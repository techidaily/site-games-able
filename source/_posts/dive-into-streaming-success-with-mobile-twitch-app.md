### Key Takeaways

* Start live streaming on Twitch from your Android phone by opening the app's Creator Mode, selecting**Create > Stream IRL** , customizing the stream's details for optimum viewer engagement, and tapping Stream.
* On iOS, once in Creator Mode, tap**Create > Stream IRL** , personalize the stream information, and hit Stream to go live.
* While Twitch mobile streaming is easy, limitations include a small chat window, it automatically ends if the phone screen locks, and the inability to capture the screen and camera simultaneously.

 You don't need to use your laptop or desktop computer to go live on Twitch. Twitch's mobile apps on Android and iOS have the functionality baked in, allowing you to live stream from your phone—and this is how it works.

## Limitations of Live Streaming on Twitch via Mobile

 Streaming on Twitch via mobile is convenient, but it has several limitations you should be aware of.

* If you're streaming your screen, everything you see is also visible to your viewers.
* Because of the limited screen space, you get a small window for viewing chats, which won't be optimal if you receive many messages from your viewers.
* The stream will automatically end if your screen is locked. Therefore, ensure your phone's screen doesn't lock to avoid the stream being cut short. You should also avoid using headphones or any Bluetooth-powered speakers, as they won't provide the best audio experience. According to Twitch, don't use headphones if you need to capture all the sounds.
* Unlike on PC, you can't simultaneously capture your screen and camera. You'll have to pick one.

 Streaming on Twitch via mobile is quite straightforward compared to streaming on your laptop or desktop. But this convenience comes with its downsides. You should note the limitations and see if you can tolerate them. Otherwise, you're better off using a laptop or desktop to go live on Twitch.
