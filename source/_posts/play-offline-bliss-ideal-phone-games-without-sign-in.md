## 2\. Plague Inc

 If you've ever played the Pandemic flash game, you'll love Plague Inc. The concept is the same: your goal is to spread the plague, infect the world, and bring humanity to an end.

 It sounds like it would be easy, but this is a strategy game at its core—not so difficult that you'll want to give up, but it offers enough of a challenge to keep you playing. Every country will try its best to stop the plague, so you'll need to be quick and smart to stop them.

## 4\. Unblock Me

 You may know Unblock Me by its real-life counterpart, Rush Hour. The setup is simple: you have a 6x6 grid of blocks that can only move in the direction of their length, and your goal is to get the red block out of the grid.

 Your goal is to climb each level as high as you can go. Just make sure you don't fall or collide with any enemies. There are lots of unique obstacles that pose a challenge, but there are also many power-ups to help you out.
