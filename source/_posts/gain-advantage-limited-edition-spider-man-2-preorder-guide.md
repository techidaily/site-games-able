## Gain Advantage: Limited-Edition Spider-Man 2 Preorder Guide

 The PlayStation 5 has been available for many years now, but the very first limited-edition console is about to hit the market. And it’s not just any limited-edition console. It’s a Marvel's Spider-Man 2 limited-edition console.

 The Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5 console is undeniably cool and pretty much guaranteed to sell out at record speeds. It's already sold out at a few different establishments, but there are a couple of places where you can still get your hands on this elusive PS5.

## When Can I Get the Limited-Edition Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5?

But considering the hype for this limited-edition console, the chances are it could be sold out long before you get to your local store to pick it up.

 Like many limited-edition items, the golden rule is that if you really want it, you should preorder it. That way, you can sit back and play some video games on your Spider-Man-themed PS5 on release day instead of crying into a pint of Ben & Jerry’s.
