## Acquiring Your Steam Identifier Without Hassle

 Every user on Steam has a Steam ID. It's a unique number that identifies your account. Third-party tools can sometimes require it to link to your account.

 We're going to explain everything you need to know about your Steam ID, including how to find out what it is.

## What Is a Steam ID?

 Every account on Steam has a unique Steam ID. You will never have the same Steam ID as someone else. It exists in a few formats, but is often shown as a 17-digit number known as the 64-bit ID. It's tied to your account and you can't change it.

 Your Steam ID is not your username, which you use to sign in to Steam (you can't change this). It's also not your display name, which is what you appear as to other players (you can [change your Steam display name](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-steam-display-name/) ).

 Your Steam ID may appear in your profile URL. By default, Steam profile URLs format like so, with your Steam ID appended: <https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/>

 If you've [set a custom URL for your Steam profile](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-custom-url-steam-profile/) in your account settings, "profiles" becomes "id" and your custom text appends instead of your Steam ID.

## Why Do You Need Your Steam ID?

 You may never need to know what your Steam ID is. It's not private information, so don't worry if someone says they know your Steam ID—you can just as easily find out theirs, using tools like [Steam ID Finder](https://www.steamidfinder.com/) .

 Some third-party services or developers/publishers (like Ubisoft and EA) can ask for your Steam ID. They might need this to link something to your account or to look you up in their database to provide support.

## How to Find Your Steam ID

It's simple to find out what your Steam ID is. Here's how:

1. Open the Steam client.
2. Click your**profile picture** in the top-right.
3. Click**Account details** .
4. Your Steam ID is listed at the top of the page, beneath the title.

## Find Out More About Your Steam Account

 You might not have known that your Steam account has a unique ID. Should you ever get asked for it, you now have the knowledge to retrieve it.

 Did you know that you can also view your entire Steam purchase history from your account? It's worth poking around in your account settings to see if there's anything you want to customize.
