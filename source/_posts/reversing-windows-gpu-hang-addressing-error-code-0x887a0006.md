It displays an error message window that includes a 0x887A0006 code and says, ‚ÄúA problem has occurred with your display driver.‚Äù

 Microsoft has described the DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE\_HUNG error to be a command communication issue between system hardware and games. This error is a big deal when it keeps crashing affected Windows games. However, players have resolved the 0x887A0006 error with these potential fixes.

## 1\. Set Affected Games to Run With Administrator Rights

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Update Your GPU‚Äôs Driver

 The 0x887A0006 error message explicitly says that an issue has occurred with your PC‚Äôs display (graphics) adapter. That could mean there‚Äôs an outdated graphics driver on your PC that isn‚Äôt compatible with affected games. The probable solution in such a scenario is to update the driver for your PC‚Äôs GPU.

 You can update an NVIDIA or AMD driver in a few different ways. Some users utilize driver updater software packages, but some of them don't update graphics drivers to the newest ones available. To ensure you‚Äôre installing the very latest driver available for your GPU, download it from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.

 Our guide for [updating your graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) provides further details about the various methods.

## 7\. Disable DirectX 12 in Any Affected Games

2. Click the circle button that includes your user initials.
3. Select the**Settings** option on the menu that opens.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 9\. Don‚Äôt Overclock Your PC

 Overclocking GPUs or CPUs (central processors) is one of the more common causes of error 0x887A0006\. Have you overclocked your PC with overclocking software like CPU Tweaker, AMD Ryzan Master, or MSI Afterburner in any way? If so, it‚Äôs recommended you disable (undo) any overclocking you‚Äôve applied by restoring default system values with whatever overclock software you utilize.

![The DWORD (32-bit) Value option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-dword-option.jpg)
4. Type**TdrLevel** inside the DWORD‚Äôs text box.
5. Double-click**TdrLevel** to view a**Value data** box for that DWORD.  
![The Edit DWORD (32-bit) Value window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-edit-dword-value-box.jpg)
6. Enter**0** in TdrLevel‚Äôs**Value** box, and select**OK** to save.
