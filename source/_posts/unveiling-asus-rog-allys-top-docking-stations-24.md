## Unveiling ASUS ROG Ally's Top Docking Stations '24

 The ASUS ROG Ally certainly gives Valve's Steam Deck a run for its money, but much like the latter, sometimes you want to play on the big screen. Not only does the Asus ROG Ally have its own official docking station, but many of the [best Steam Deck docks](http://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-dock-alternatives/) work just as well with ASUS' handheld, making it really easy to extend its functionality.

## Best Overall ASUS ROG Ally Dock: UGREEN Steam Deck Dock
![UGREEN Steam Deck Dock connected to steam deck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ugreen-steam-deck-dock-connected-to-steam-deck.png)

UGREEN

 Let's start by talking about the elephant in the room: the [UGREEN Steam Deck Dock](http://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Ethernet-Charging-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0BQB6VG39?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2027251&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-rog-ally-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) has "Steam Deck Dock" in its name. While the device is advertised as being a Steam Deck dock, it also works with the ASUS ROG Ally. In fact, you can even use it for your iPad or most other devices with a USB-C output.

 Not only can you use the UGREEN Steam Deck Dock to connect your ASUS ROG Ally to your TV, but it also has an Ethernet port, letting you download games quicker or even giving you the upper hand in competitive games with a lower ping. The USB 3.0 and USB-C ports can be used to add peripherals to your ASUS ROG Ally, including a keyboard and mouse or even a portable hard drive.

![ugreen steam deck dock](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ugreen-steam-deck-dock.png)

##### UGREEN Steam Deck Dock

Best Overall

 The UGREEN Steam Deck Dock comes with everything you need to play your ASUS ROG Ally on your TV. It even includes an Ethernet port, as well as USB and USB-C ports.

**Pros**

## Best Budget ASUS ROG Ally Dock: iVoler Docking Station
![iVoler Docking Station compatible with asus rog ally](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ivoler-docking-station-compatible-with-asus-rog-ally.png)

iVoler

 Playing your ASUS ROG Ally on your TV might be awesome, but simply connecting the ROG Ally to your TV may not be enough, especially if you want to add peripherals like a keyboard, mouse, and headset. The [iVoler Docking Station](http://www.amazon.com/Docking-Station-iVoler-Support-Charging/dp/B0B46337V4?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2027251&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-rog-ally-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) offers an affordable solution for playing your favorite games on your TV in stunning 4K@60Hz. It also includes three USB ports, HDMI, and a USB-C port for fast charging your device.

 The only downside to the iVoler Docking Station is the lack of an Ethernet port, which can help alleviate lag while gaming and also speed up download times with a physical connection. But the ASUS ROG Ally comes with Wi-Fi 6E support, so if you have a [Wi-Fi 6E router](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-wi-fi-6e-routers/) , you should still get impressive speeds even without Ethernet connectivity.

##### iVoler Docking Station

**Pros**

**Cons**

* No Ethernet port

ASUS

 If you want to invest in an official charger and dock, the [ASUS ROG 65W Charger Dock](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-65w-charger-dock-supports-hdmi-2-0-with-usb-type-a-and-usb-type-c-for-rog-ally-black%2F6542054.p%3FskuId%3D6542054) is the best choice. However, it doesn't offer as many features as third-party options and could end up costing you a little more.

 This 65W charger dock supports HDMI 2.0 and includes a USB Type-A and USB Type-C port. Supporting 1080p@120Hz or 4K@60Hz, the ASUS ROG 65W Charger Dock lets you enjoy your games on the big screen. You can also charge two devices at once, up to 60W using the USB-C port and 5W using the USB-A port.

 With an HDMI 2.0 output, the LISEN Steam Deck Dock can output 4K video at 60Hz with ease. It also includes two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports for fast data transfer, as well as three USB 2.0 ports for connecting your peripherals.

## FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between the Steam Deck and ROG Ally?

 The biggest difference between the two handhelds is hardware. In almost every category—display, performance, SSD—the Asus ROG Ally is noticeably better, like its 120Hz panel, as opposed to the Steam Deck's 60Hz panel. For the finer details, check out our guide pitting the [Asus ROG Ally against the Steam Deck](https://www.makeuseof.com/asus-rog-ally-vs-steam-deck-which-is-better-on-paper/) .

### Q: Is the ROG Ally basically a PC?

 Yes, much like the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally is just a PC in a handheld form factor.

### Q: Can the ASUS ROG Ally play Steam games?

 Yes, you can. Not only will the ASUS ROG Ally run Steam games, but you can run games available on Windows, GOG, Epic Games, Xbox Game Pass, and beyond.

### Q: How do I put the ROG Ally into docked mode?

 On the original ASUS ROG Ally Charging Dock, you'll see three ports: HDMI, USB-C, and USB-A.

* Plug the charging dock into an outlet.
* Connect an HDMI cable from the external monitor to the HDMI port on the charging dock.
* Now plug in a USB-C cable from the ASUS ROG Ally to the USB-C port on the charging dock.

 Once you've done that, you're good to go! Your ASUS ROG Ally is now a dedicated desktop PC. You're welcome to use the remaining USB-A port for a Bluetooth dongle or connect wirelessly to the handheld itself.
