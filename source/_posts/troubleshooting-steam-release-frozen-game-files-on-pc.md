## Troubleshooting Steam: Release Frozen Game Files on PC

 Games updates are a big part of the gaming world, but what do you do if you try to update a Steam game and get the “content file locked” error?

 This may happen due to incorrect permission settings or corrupted cache data, among other reasons. Either way, the solutions below will help you fix the issue in no time.

## 1\. Check for Conflicting Apps

 There’s a chance you keep running into the "content file locked” error on Steam due to conflicting apps. Even if you’ve closed potential conflicting apps, their processes might still be running in the background and interfering with Steam’s functionality.

 Instead of searching through Task Manager for interfering processes, restart your computer to stop them from running.

 Additionally, try temporarily turning off Windows firewall and the third-party antivirus, if you’ve installed one. If Steam now works as usual, you should[allow it through the Windows firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) or add it to your antivirus exception list.

## 2\. Run Steam With Administrative Privileges

 As we’ve mentioned, permission issues might cause the “Content file locked” error on Steam. If you’ve signed in using a guest account, Steam might lack the necessary permission.

 In this case, switch to an administrator account. If you’re already using an administrator account, there’s one more thing you should try. Right-click Steam’s executable file and select**Run as administrator** . Then, try to update the problematic game.

 If this solved the issue, you should have Windows always run Steam with administrator privileges. Check out[how to always run apps as an administrator on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) for more information on how to do this.

## 3\. Clear the Steam Download Cache

 Steam downloads and stores cache data for every game in your library whenever it installs a new update. But if the stored cache got corrupted or Steam can’t access it, you’ll run into the locked content error.

 In this case, deleting Steam’s cache data should fix the issue.

1. Launch Steam’s client.
2. Click**Steam** in the top-left corner and head to**Settings** .
3. Open the**Downloads** menu.
4. Click on**Clear Download Cache** .
5. Confirm the action in the subsequent pop-up window.

 After rebuilding its cache, Steam should have no issue updating your game. But if that’s not the case, move on to the next solution.

## 4\. Check the Game's File Integrity

 If the “content file locked” is limited to a specific game, there might be a problem with the game’s files. Fortunately, you don’t have to reinstall your Steam games to fix the issue. You can have Steam check the file’s integrity and fix the issue for you.

 To do so, right-click the problematic title and select**Properties** . Then, from the left pane, choose**Installed Files** . Click**Verify integrity of game files** and Steam will now search and automatically fix any detected issues.

## 5\. Reset Winsock

 Winsock (short for "Windows Socket API") is an application programming interface designed to establish communication between your Windows network software and network services.

 If Winsock isn’t working as usual, Steam might have trouble connecting to its servers and fail to update your games. Fortunately, you can reset Winsock and get it back working using a command line.

[Launch Command Prompt as administrator](http://makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) and type in the**netsh winsock reset** command. Then, press**Enter** to run it. Reboot your computer and check if the issue is now fixed.

## 6\. Reinstall Steam

 If you still can’t update any game in your library and still can’t find a way to fix Steam, you should reinstall the app. Press**Windows key + I** to launch Windows Settings and go to**Apps > Installed apps** . There, click the**three-dot** icon next to**Steam** and select**Uninstall** .

![Uninstall Steam on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/uninstall-steam-1.jpg)

 Then, head to[the Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/) and download the app. Of course, you’ll have to reinstall every game, but you can speed up the process by[batch-installing Steam games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/its-easy-to-batch-install-and-uninstall-steam-games/) .
