## Ultimate List: 7 Must-Play Sports Games on Mobile

 Mobile gaming has revolutionized the way we engage with our favorite sports. Now, with just a few taps on your smartphone, you can compete against opponents worldwide and hone your skills in single-player matches in your favorite mobile sports games.

 Below, we've created a list of the best sports games for mobile users, each offering unique features that have earned them a spot on our list. We’ve included a game from every popular sport on this list, so no matter which sports your passion lies in, you’re likely to find a game that caters to your interests.

## 1\. Table Tennis Touch
![Table Tennis Touch gameplay](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/table-tennis-touch-gameplay.jpeg)

 Table Tennis Touch is user-friendly, with simple gameplay mechanics and impressive animation and graphics. The game boasts four engaging modes: Career, Quick Game, and Arcade.

 The Quick Game mode can be played against AI-controlled opponents from various countries. All you have to do to play is hit the ball across the table by swiping your racket. You’re awarded a point if your opponent misses the ball, and you lose a point to your opponent if you miss the ball instead.

 One thing disappointing about the game is that you cannot play against real opponents. Although a multiplayer mode is provided, accessing it requires downloading a separate multiplayer version of Table Tennis Touch called Ping Pong Fury.

 Ping Pong Fury, although popular, lacks many of the features present in Table Tennis Touch, such as offline gameplay and career and arcade modes. The game's developers should consider integrating a multiplayer mode within Table Tennis Touch itself.

**Download:** Table Tennis Touch for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/table-tennis-touch/id860620713) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.yakuto.TableTennisTouch) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 2\. Tennis Clash

 Tennis Clash is one of the [best mobile multiplayer games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-awesome-cross-platform-mobile-multiplayer-games/) on this list that delivers a thrilling tennis experience with stunning 3D graphics and intuitive controls. The gameplay mechanics are easy to master—all you have to do is position where you want to hit the ball and swipe on the screen to deliver a hit. You earn a point when your opponent fails to return the ball and concede a point if you miss the ball yourself.

 In Tennis Clash, you can play offline matches against an AI opponent or with real players worldwide in iconic locations such as New York, Sydney, Rio, Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, and more. Additionally, you can join or create clubs and play in exciting events.

 One thing that the developers of Tennis Clash could work on is the match-making ability of the game. Several players have complained about being matched to opponents with a far higher skill level. The in-game purchases to level up your player are also a bit costly.

 Aside from these drawbacks, we’d say the game offers the best realistic tennis action we’ve seen in any other tennis game so far.

**Download:** Tennis Clash for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tennis-clash-sports-stars-game/id1346179411) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfgco.games.sports.free.tennis.clash) (Free, in-app purchases available)

 Several titles compete for the top spot in the list of [best mobile cricket games](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-cricket-games-for-iphone-and-android/) . However, one game that stands out as our personal favorite is Cricket 22, thanks to its user-friendly interface and advanced gameplay mechanics.

 The graphics and animations in Cricket 22 are truly remarkable. You can customize various aspects of the match, including the stadium, difficulty level, number of overs, pitch type, time of day, and even the commentator. Every aspect of the game, whether it's batting, bowling, making runs, catching a ball, or executing a run-out, is manually controlled by you. This level of control delivers the most authentic gaming experience that truly helps you appreciate [the differences between 3D and 2D games](https://www.makeuseof.com/2d-games-vs-3d-games-differences/) .

 While Cricket 22 offers an exceptional gaming experience, mastering its gameplay mechanics may require some practice. However, you are just a little practice away from thoroughly enjoying the rewarding experience that Cricket 22 has to offer.

**Download:** Real Cricket 22 for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/real-cricket-22/id1577721431) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nautilus.realcricket) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 4\. FIFA Soccer

 FIFA Soccer is the official FIFA World Cup 2022™ mobile game and is one of [the best FIFA companion apps for iPhone and Android](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-for-fifa-iphone-android/) . The game is about building your ultimate dream team and dominating the football pitch. You can swap and compare different players, form different lineups and formations, and unlock the powerful abilities of players in your team by training them and getting skill boosts.

 The gameplay is smooth with manual controls, allowing you to pass, tackle, shoot goals, and more with precision and skill. FIFA Soccer truly captures the essence of the game with its stunning graphics and lifelike animations that bring every football match to life on your mobile screen.

 The only thing that we thought could be improved was the interface. Currently, the game features are spread out, and it can be challenging to familiarize oneself with all the functionalities. A more organized home page with all game features neatly placed under relevant sections or categories would greatly benefit players.

**Download:** FIFA Soccer for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fifa-soccer/id1094930513) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.fifamobile) (Free, in-app purchases available)

![NBA 2K Basketball game gameplay](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nba-2k-basketball-game-gameplay.jpeg)

 NBA 2K Mobile Basketball Game is the highest-rated basketball game on mobile. You can collect virtual player cards representing real NBA players to build a team you’d like to play with. Additionally, NBA 2K Mobile offers daily mini-games called Drills, which allow you to test your skills in different basketball-related challenges and earn rewards.

 Hockey All Stars is one of the best hockey mobile games featuring fast-paced gameplay that aims to capture the excitement and intensity of ice hockey. As you progress through the game, you can upgrade your team of All-Star players through training or by collecting player cards. You can either play against bots in-game or face off against other players' teams online.

 The game follows simple rules that involve poke-checking opponents to steal the puck and strategically maneuvering your way toward the goal by passing the puck to your teammates. Once you are in a favorable position near the goal, you can aim and shoot to attempt to score a goal.

 However, the game bots in Hockey All Stars do not pose a significant challenge and lack basic defensive and offensive skills, making it too easy to score goals against them. By creating a more balanced and competitive AI system, this game has great potential to deliver a more engaging and enjoyable experience for players.

**Download:** Hockey All Stars for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hockey-all-stars/id1437616335) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distinctivegames.hockey2019) (Free, in-app purchases available)
