## Exit Strategy for Realms: World Restoration Guide

 If youâ€™re taking the usual Minecraft hiatus, you wonâ€™t want to keep being charged for Minecraft Realms, but you also wonâ€™t want to lose your world. Hereâ€™s how to unsubscribe from Minecraft Realms and keep your world for future use.

## How to Unsubscribe from Minecraft Realms on Bedrock and Java Edition

 In this guide, weâ€™ll be using the Microsoft account to unsubscribe from Minecraft Realms. If youâ€™re on a different platform on Bedrock Edition, you should still be able to find your subscription on your Microsoft account if you made the purchase with it. If you made the purchase using Google Play, PlayStation, Amazon, or iOS, you will need to find the subscription manangement settings on your respective platform.

### 1\. Open Your Microsoft Order History

## What Happens After Unsubscribing from Minecraft Realms?

![Pencil button on Minecraft Realms Bedrock Edition](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/pencil-button-on-minecraft-realms-bedrock-edition.jpg)

 When you unsubscribe from Minecraft Realms, you wonâ€™t lose your access until the next billing cycle. Youâ€™ll be able to use your Realms until that date, but when it expires, you will lose a few things.

 For both the Java and Bedrock Editions, your personal server will go offline, meaning neither you nor your friends will be able to join your Realm. On the Bedrock Edition, youâ€™ll also lose access to the free Marketplace content from Realms Plus.

 You wonâ€™t lose your Realms world immediately, and the backups will still exist. However, the Realms servers will only keep them for 18 months. Weâ€™ll be covering how to download your Minecraft Realms backups for offline play or on[free Minecraft server hosting services](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-minecraft-server-free/) .

## How to Download Your Minecraft Realms Worlds After Unsubscribing

 If you donâ€™t want to lose your backups, you should download them locally. Hereâ€™s how to download your backups and find the files so you can use them elsewhere.

![Configure button Minecraft Realms Java Edition](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/configure-button-minecraft-realms-java-edition.jpg)

![Minecraft Realms Java Edition World backups button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/minecraft-realms-java-edition-world-backups-button.jpg)

![Minecraft Realms Java Edition Backups section](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/minecraft-realms-java-edition-backups-section.jpg)

 Finally, you can click on**Download latest** or choose the specific backup you want to save.

![Minecraft Java Edition world saves file location](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/minecraft-java-edition-world-saves-file-location.jpg)

 Once itâ€™s saved, itâ€™ll show up in your single-player worlds with your username. In this case itâ€™s Majikoeda. The file location can be found in**AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/saves** in case you want to move it to a different device, upload it to a server hosting service, or save it on Google Drive. That file location can also be used to[add downloadable Minecraft maps](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-install-minecraft-maps/) .

![Download backup button on Minecraft Realms Bedrock Edition](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/download-backup-button-on-minecraft-realms-bedrock-edition.jpg)

 Click on**Backups,** then click on the**download** **icon** beside the backup of your choosing. In our case, we just have one backup for this test server.

 Once you download your backup, it will be available in the single-player section for offline play.

 Clicking on the**pencil icon** beside the single-player downloaded backup will allow you to click**Play on Realm** in the future if you re-subscribe. Instead of finding the file on your device, you can also scroll down to the very bottom and click on**Export World** . This is much quicker as the Bedrock Editionâ€™s world files are harder to find.
