## Mac Gaming Enhanced: Counter-Strike 2 Basics

### Key Takeaways

* Mac users can still play Counter-Strike 2 on their devices using CrossOver, despite Valve discontinuing macOS support for the game.
* To install CrossOver, visit the CodeWeavers website and download the trial version or purchase the software.
* After installing CrossOver, download and install the Windows version of Steam, then search for and install Counter-Strike 2 from the Store section. Adjust CrossOver settings for optimal performance before launching the game.

 Counter-Strike 2 has replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but unfortunately for Mac users, Valve has discontinued macOS support for its latest title, citing notably low player counts on the platform. But that doesn't mean Mac users don't have options. Here's how to play the popular title on your Mac.

Fortunately,

## Install CrossOver to Play Counter-Strike 2

 Just because there is no native support for the game doesn't mean you can't play it. CrossOver allows you to run the Windows edition of Counter-Strike 2 on your Mac, ensuring you can still indulge in your preferred esports title. The first step to enjoying Counter-Strike 2 is then, naturally, to download and install CrossOver on your Mac. You can do so by following these steps:

![CrossOver Download page requesting for email address, name and OS.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/crossover-download-page.jpg)

1. Head over to the [CodeWeavers website](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/download) to download CrossOver. You can use the 14-day trial to test it out before committing to a purchase ($74).
2. Ensure your operating system is set to**macOS** , then provide your name and email address. Finally, click on**Download Trial Now** to initiate the download.
3. To complete the installation, simply double-click the**crossover.zip** file you downloaded to extract the app. Subsequently, move the**CrossOver** app to [the Applications folder](https://www.makeuseof.com/applications-folder-mac/) .
4. When you run the app for the first time, you'll come across a prompt asking you to buy or try CrossOver. For now, you can select the**Try Now** option.

## Download Steam and Install Counter-Strike 2

 After successfully installing CrossOver, proceed to install the Windows version of Steam to access and download Counter-Strike 2\. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the**Install** tab located in the bottom left corner of the CrossOver menu. You can either search for**Steam** using the search bar or directly choose it from the Popular Applications section.
2. Double-click on the**Steam** option and click on the**Install** button.

3. CrossOver will initiate the automatic download of the Steam setup. Once the installation process starts, follow all subsequent prompts and agree to the License agreement.
4. **Steam** will now open automatically, and you can log in to your existing account or create a new one.

5. After logging into your Steam account, proceed to the**Store** section. Search for Counter-Strike 2, and initiate the download by clicking**Play Game** on the store page and then selecting the Install button. You can also [run the game from an external drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-steam-games-on-an-external-drive-with-steam-storage-manager/) if you're low on internal storage.

 Now, you simply need to be patient while Steam completes the download.

## Configuring CrossOver for Counter-Strike 2

 Before launching Counter-Strike 2, it's essential to adjust settings in CrossOver to enhance performance and stability. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Close the Steam window, and open CrossOver again.
2. Select the**Steam** bottle and toggle on**D3DMetal** on the right. This will enable [hardware acceleration via DirectX](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-directx-why-important-for-gaming/) and translate all API calls to Metal.  
![CrossOver Steam bottle configuration settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/steam-bottle-configuration-settings-crossover.jpg)
3. Reopen Steam, go to**Library** , Control-click on Counter-Strike 2, and navigate to**Properties > General** .
4. Type in the following command under the**Launch Options** field:  
`-nojoy -+cl_forcepreload 1 -novid`  
![Counter-Strike 2 Launch Options page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/counter-strike-2-launch-options.jpg)
5. Finally, click the**Play** button to start the game. Note that during the first launch, it may take a couple of minutes for the game to start up.

 Expect some stuttering in your initial few games as shaders are being cached in the background. It's advisable to start by playing a few matches against bots before diving into an online game.

## Start Playing Counter-Strike 2 on Your Mac

 Mac users need not be disheartened by the discontinuation of macOS support for Counter-Strike 2\. Thanks to CrossOver, enjoying the successor to CS:GO on your Mac is still possible.

 By following the steps outlined above, from installing CrossOver to configuring settings for optimal performance, you can successfully run Counter-Strike 2 and experience your favorite esports title on macOS.
