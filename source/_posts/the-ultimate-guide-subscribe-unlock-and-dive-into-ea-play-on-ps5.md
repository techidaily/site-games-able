## The Ultimate Guide: Subscribe, Unlock, and Dive Into EA Play on PS5

 One of the ways you can save cost on games on an Xbox or a PS5 is by getting a subscription. Sony offers subscriptions in the PlayStation Store apart from PlayStation Plus, and EA Play stands among the best in terms of value for money.

 EA has published and developed numerous household titles and franchises, including Need for Speed, the Sims, FIFA, UFC, Star Wars, and many others. EA Play offers a way to tap into EA’s PS4 and PS5 games without buying them all individually.

## What Is EA Play?

 Essentially, EA Play (once known as EA Access) is a subscription service for PlayStation and Xbox that offers select EA titles to “rent” while your subscription is on. It also gives you a 10% discount on some non-free titles, season passes, points packs, and DLCs. Lastly, EA Play membership will give you a free 10-hour early access trial to some EA games, and your progress will sync should you choose to buy the game.

 You can[get EA Play on PC through Xbox Game Pass](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-pc/) . But your subscription won’t carry over to PlayStation. EA Play on Xbox and PlayStation are not the same, and they offer different games.

 EA Play on the PS5 is $4.99/month or $29.99/year, and it will grant you access to more than 50 games. This makes it way cheaper than any of the[PlayStation Plus subscription tiers](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-plus-essential-vs-extra-vs-premium/) . Judging solely by the number of games available, EA Play will give you more value than PlayStation Plus Essential ($9.99/month).

 By the way, EA Play is one of the[ways you can get The Sim 4 for free](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-and-play-the-sims-4-for-free/) .

## How to Subscribe to EA Play on the PS5

 Trying to navigate your PS5 to pay for EA Play could be a little tricky. Before you begin, you must[add a card as a payment method on your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/add-psn-wallet-funds-and-buy-games-on-ps5/) (EA Play insists you have a card even though it will charge your wallet). So, we’ve detailed all the steps you should follow to successfully subscribe to it:

1. Navigate to and select**PlayStation Store** from your PS5’s home.
2. Tap**R1** till you reach the**Subscriptions** tab.
3. Scroll down till you see EA Play’s banner and choose**Learn More** .

4. Select**$4.99** and choose**Order & Pay** .

 In the image above, you’ll see that EA Play is going for $0.99\. This is a limited offer and doesn’t reflect the regular price.

 If you have money in your wallet, EA Play will debit the wallet before any other payment method—even on subsequent renewals.

## How to Use an EA Play Membership on the PS5

 You won’t automatically find EA Play games in your library; you must go to the Play List to find and download the games. Here’s how to find them:

1. Go to**PlayStation Store > Subscriptions** and scroll down to EA Play’s banner.
2. Select**View Games** , and you’ll find yourself in the**EA Play Play List** .

3. Navigate to the game you wish to download, select the cover art, and choose**Download** or the discount game price button.  
![Battlefield 4 EA Play PlayStation Store page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/battlefield-4-ea-play-playstation-store-page.JPG)

 The game will download and install on your device from there. If you got the game free, you’ll no longer have access when your EA Play membership expires. However, if you bought it with the 10% discount, you’ll have the game forever.

 You can tell which games in your library are EA Play games; just look for the tiny red circular EA Logo when you highlight the game.

## How to Cancel an EA Play Membership on the PS5

 You might no longer want EA Play after paying for the first month. And this might be the best course of action if you’re only trying to use the membership to get discounts. In that case, head into **Settings > Account > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions > EA Play > Cancel Subscription** .
