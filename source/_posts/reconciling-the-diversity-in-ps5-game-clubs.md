## Reconciling the Diversity in PS5 Game Clubs

 Subscriptions can make gaming a lot cheaper by giving you huge discounts and offering you game bundles for a small recurring fee. Sony has integrated this into the PS5 by creating a section for gaming subscriptions in the PlayStation Store and a way to manage them all in Settings.

 We’ll show you everything you need to know to navigate subscriptions, where you can find them, and how to cancel and renew them.

## What Are the Available Gaming Subscriptions on the PS5?

 You can find the dedicated PlayStation Store subscriptions page by going to the**PlayStation Store** and tapping**R1** on your controller till you reach**Subscriptions** .

 While there’s a dedicated page for subscriptions, Sony offers only three for the US region:

* **PlayStation Plus** \- Sony’s flagship game subscription service. You can learn all about the[PlayStation Plus subscription tiers](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-plus-essential-vs-extra-vs-premium/) in our dedicated guide.
* **Ubisoft+ Classics** \- A compilation of some of the best Ubisoft games on PlayStation. It comes with a PS Plus Extra and Premium subscription.
* **EA Play** \- It’s a standalone EA subscription that grants you access to generous discounts and access to over 50 games for only $5/month. We’ve previously explained[how to subscribe to EA Play on your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-subscribe-to-and-use-ea-play-on-ps5/) if you’re interested.

 Sony might add more subscriptions down the line, but this is all it offers for now. You can check back to this page as often as possible to see what’s new. Sometimes there could be huge sales on the subscriptions, too.

## How to Manage Your PS5 Subscriptions

 You pay for subscriptions by going to**Subscriptions** in the PlayStation Store, and you can also view the games in their collections from there. However, there’s a dedicated panel in the PS5’s settings for managing your ongoing or terminated gaming subscriptions.

### How to View Your PS5 Subscriptions

 If you would like to have a look at all the subscriptions you’ve made on your PS5 (active and inactive), here’s what to do:

1. Open**Settings** and go to**Users and Accounts** .  
![Users and Accounts section of the PS5 settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/users-and-accounts-section-of-the-ps5-settings.JPG)
2. Select**Account** inside the Users and Accounts panel and choose**Payment and Subscriptions** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Scroll down the Payment and Subscriptions menu and select**Subscriptions** to a list of your subscriptions.  
![List of subscriptions in the Subscriptions page of the PS5's settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/list-of-subscriptions-in-the-subscriptions-page-of-the-ps5-s-settings.JPG)

 If you have no current or previous subscriptions, you’ll see a message saying, “You don’t have any subscriptions right now.”

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### How to Cancel Your PS5 Subscriptions

 For those who have active subscriptions, you can easily cancel them by following these steps:

1. After you go to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions** , you should see a list of your subscriptions.
2. Select the one you would like to cancel.
3. Navigate to the**Cancel Subscription** button on the left and tap**X** on your controller.  
![EA Play subscription settings page on a PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ea-play-subscription-settings-page-on-a-ps5.JPG)
4. You’ll get a message informing you that you won’t be billed again for your subscription.  
![Prompt notifying when EA Play subscription will cancel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/prompt-notifying-when-ea-play-subscription-will-cancel.JPG)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Canceling your subscription doesn’t mean losing your benefits. Your benefits only expire once the subscription has run its course. Canceling only means you won’t be charged again.

 Even with an inactive (or canceled) subscription, you can return here to manually buy your subscription again by selecting**Buy Again** . This saves you from being debited every month or year, and you can choose when exactly you would like to renew your subscription as long as it’s before the billing month ends.

### How to Renew Your PS5 Subscriptions

 If you have a subscription you once paid for, like PlayStation Plus, for example, you can renew it in subscription settings. But “renewal” only happens when your subscription billing month has ended.

Here’s how to renew a PS5 gaming subscription:

1. Go to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions** to open your list of subscriptions.
2. Choose the one you would like to renew from the list.
3. Select**Subscribe** .  
![PlayStation Plus subscription page in the PS5's subscription settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/playstation-plus-subscription-page-in-the-ps5-s-subscription-settings.JPG)
4. Follow the payment steps.

 That’s all it takes to renew a subscription on your PS5\. You will be billed recurrently until you cancel with the above-mentioned steps.

## Keep Track of All Your PS5 Subscriptions

 Subscriptions can rack up, and they are sneaky, easy-to-forget bills. However, the PS5 does make it easy with the way its UI works. Even though the subscriptions are embedded a little deep in the settings, it’s pretty easy to navigate and keep tabs on your subscriptions once you know where it is.

 And once again, subscriptions can be a great way to make gaming on a PS5 cheaper.
