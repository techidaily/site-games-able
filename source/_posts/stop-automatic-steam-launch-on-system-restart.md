## Stop Automatic Steam Launch on System Restart

 Steam automatically launches when you sign in to your computer. This is fine if you often immediately jump in to a game, or want to appear online so you can talk to friends on Steam Chat, but chances are it isn't necessary.

 If you have lots of programs set to launch on startup, it can slow down your computer. Steam might also unexpectedly drain your data when updates download in the background. Besides, it doesn't take long to launch Steam.

 We're going to show you how to disable Steam's automatic launch on startup.
