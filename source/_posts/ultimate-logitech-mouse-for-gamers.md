## Ultimate Logitech Mouse for Gamers

 Logitech has made a name for itself crafting reliable, high-performing gaming mice—really, the majority of PC gadgets and gizmos.

 Let's take a look at the best Logitech gaming mice available today.

![Logitech G502 X Plus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Logitech-G502-X-Plus.jpg)

##### Logitech G502 X Plus

Best Overall

The king of Logitech gaming mice

 $141$160 Save $19

 With more than a dozen programmable buttons, textured siding, and a matte finish, the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed is made for nothing else other than gaming. And with its impressive battery life, you don't have to worry about long gaming sessions.

**Pros**

* Slopes and dips in the design feel comfortable in the hands
* Up to 120 hours of battery life (and rechargeable)
* 13 programmable buttons
* Compatible with the PowerPlay charging system
* Glides across the mat like an ice skater

**Cons**

* Does fine with FPS games, though you may want something lighter

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G-Artanis-WL-Black/dp/B092CB69Q4?linkCode=ll1&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=3816cca2eb6d2f6a5ee9495864040057&language=en%5FUS&ref%5F=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$141 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g502-x-plus-lightspeed-wireless-gaming-mouse-with-hero-25k-sensor-black%2F6512122.p%3FskuId%3D6512122)

 From performance to design, the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Mouse is the holy grail of Logitech gaming mice. It comes fitted with Logitech's fantastic HERO 25K optical sensor, as well as optical-mechanical switches to ensure your clicks register and provide satisfying feedback.

 More importantly, the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Mouse is designed to let you take full advantage of its performance. The extra buttons are quite distinct and easy to reach. To prevent sweaty palms from becoming a problem, the G502 X Plus also has a matte finish, along with textured siding around the side buttons.

 Lastly, the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed Mouse is entirely wireless, though you're more than welcome to attach a USB-C cable at the front (which is also included in the packaging). When fully charged, the G502 X Plus has 120 hours of juice, so it's more than up to the task of handling long gaming sessions.

##### Logitech G203 Mouse

Most Affordable

 The perfect companion for the casual gamer

 $26$40 Save $14

 With a uniform design and six-button layout, the Logitech G203 is as comfortable as it is affordable. The mouse buttons feel especially good, given their mechanical springs.

**Pros**

* Durable metal springs
* Comfortable design
* Great price per performance

**Cons**

* DPI is too low for advanced players

[$30 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082J7P19K?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$26 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g203-lightsync-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-8000-dpi-sensor-black%2F6409361.p%3FskuId%3D6409361)

 The Logitech G203 is for anyone on a tight budget but is looking for a mouse that delivers precise tracking and maximum comfort. The Omron switches and six buttons click satisfyingly, enabling you to assign quick gaming commands. Better yet, Logitech uses the metal spring button tensioning system to give you more consistency and actuation.

 The four tiny oval feet on each corner glide smoothly without any annoying scratchiness. Tracking with this mouse is enjoyable as it uses the Logitech G HUB software to provide you with up to five sensitivity settings. Although the 200-8,000 DPI optical sensor doesn’t have the high DPI resolution seen in some latest sensors, it allows you to game without any noticeable jitter or acceleration.

 There is a vast range of colors to choose from, including lilac, blue, black, and white, to suit your unique gaming style. The lighting effects on the three separate zones are well-lit, and you have the versatility to choose your preferred presets.

##### Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse

Best for MMOs

Why stop at two extra buttons?

 The Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse is a raider's best friend. It's not only sculpted for comfort but has 12 easily reachable buttons for mapping all manner of spells and skills.

**Pros**

* Highly customizable
* Feels exceptionally good
* Extra buttons are very distinct
* 12 side buttons

**Cons**

* Big learning curve

[$90 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0086UK7IQ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$40 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g600-mmo-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-black%2F5608091.p%3FskuId%3D5608091)

 The stand-out features of the Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse are the incredible customization options and a logical button layout. Shooting and raiding for hours without experiencing fatigue is possible as the mouse has a sculpted design that makes it comfortable to hold. The bottom part features low-friction polytetrafluorethylene feet, allowing the mouse to move smoothly on almost any surface.

 With an 8,200 DPI, executing actions that require ultra-fast accuracy, like in shooting games, is a breeze. Managing attacks, spells, and potions is seamless with the 20 MMO-tuned buttons. Although the buttons are squashed into a small space, it won’t take too long before you figure out the right one to press.

 You won't need to replace it any time soon either, since the mouse has a long-lasting braided cable, and the primary buttons are rated to 20 million clicks. The well-designed thumb panel places your thumb in a way that minimizes misclicks without compromising your overall comfort. This eliminates the likelihood of pressing the wrong button during a heated match.

##### Logitech G Pro X Superlight

Best for FPS

 Flick and sweep your way to the top of the leaderboards

 $103$110 Save $7

 Weighing under 63 grams, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight is the go-to mouse for fast-paced action. Along with a lightweight build, it's also fitted with Logitech's fast and accurate HERO 25K optical sensor.

**Pros**

* Fitted with Logitech's HERO 25K optical sensor
* Weighs under 63 grams
* Rechargeable battery
* Can switch between wired and wireless
* Compatible with any grip

**Cons**

* No RGB
* Left-handed people can't access the extra buttons

[$103 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RMZKYTL?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$132 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-pro-x-superlight-lightweight-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-hero-25k-sensor-black%2F6440334.p%3FskuId%3D6440334)

 If a lot of what you play involves intense action and speed, like a first-person shooter, you need a gaming mouse that keeps up with sudden and sporadic movements. With the Logitech G Pro X Superlight, you can’t ask for a better mouse—doubly so if you play competitively.

 The Logitech G Pro X Superlight is fitted with Logitech’s powerful HERO 25K optical sensor. It’s not just accurate pixel tracking that makes it so good, but the level of customization you get. You can increase the DPI all the way up to 25,600 and cap the polling rate at 1000Hz, each of which can be adjusted to your liking.

 That’s all well and good, but the Logitech G Pro X Superlight’s secret weapon is its super-light weight. At 63 grams, you barely feel the weight of the mouse, especially paired with its large PTFE feet. It glides like butter on a hot skillet, making those flicks and sweeps feel effortless.

![Logitech-MX-Vertical-Mouse-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Logitech-MX-Vertical-Mouse-1.jpg)

##### Logitech MX Vertical Mouse

Most Inclusive

 Everyone deserves to join in on the fun

 $90$100 Save $10

 The Logitech MX Vertical Mouse is the definition of ergonomic. It keeps your hand in a natural position, reducing muscle strain and fatigue to keep you gaming for longer!

**Pros**

* Great choice if you suffer from chronic physical pain
* Ergonomic design reduces strain on your wrist
* Rechargeable battery
* Can easily switch between devices

**Cons**

* Learning curve

[$90 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FNJB8TT?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$100 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-mx-vertical-advanced-wireless-optical-ergonomic-mouse-with-usb-and-bluetooth-connection-graphite%2F6282602.p%3FskuId%3D6282602)

 Combining unique customizable features with an ergonomic design, the Logitech MX Vertical Mouse is a suitable choice for avid gamers. The ruling idea behind the 57-degree tilt is to reduce muscle strain and prevent forearm twisting by ten percent compared to a non-vertical mouse. Consequently, you can play for extended sessions without experiencing discomfort.

 Battery life is a stand-out feature in the Logitech MX Vertical Mouse, as it offers you up to four months of gaming time on a single charge. In addition, you can quickly charge the mouse for one minute to get three hours of juice. The back conforms well to your palm, while the soft-touch material offers maximum comfort during long gaming sessions.

 The chances of experiencing muscle fatigue are minimal as the mouse has a 4,000 DPI high-precision sensor, which reduces hand movement up to four times. You can connect the Logitech MX Vertical Mouse to three computers simultaneously using a USB unifying receiver, USB-C charging cable, or Bluetooth technology.

##### Logitech G703 Lightspeed

Best Palm Grip

 Fast, accurate, adjustable, and perfectly suited for palm gripping

 $65$100 Save $35

 If you're moderately competitive and need an upgrade, the Logitech G703 Lightspeed is a knockout option for palm grippers. Its design gives your palm all the control while maintaining comfort.

**Pros**

* Wields Logitech's HERO 25K optical sensor
* Thumb buttons are distinct
* Includes removable weights
* Compatible with PowerPlay charging system
* Up to 35 hours of battery life

**Cons**

* Noticeably heavier than your average mouse

[$65 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NSSPV9S?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$71 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g703-lightspeed-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-black%2F6333840.p%3FskuId%3D6333840)

 The Logitech G703 Lightspeed has had a few updates since its inception. Gone is the PixArt 3366, replaced by Logitech’s excellent HERO 25K optical sensor, the same one used in many of its high-end gaming mice. It’s the kind of sensor you want in any competitive situation, whether it’s a local event or when money is on the line.

 More importantly, the Logitech G703 Lightspeed is a palm-gripper’s best friend. The secret is in the design, with a large hump in the back that your palm can comfortably cradle for maximum control. Additionally, the mouse buttons are quite sensitive. As a palm gripper, the fingertips are doing the work rather than your knuckles.

 Lastly, the Logitech G703 Lightspeed is open to some light customization. Along with six programmable buttons, you can pick up an extra 10-gram weight if you want a little more heft. Logitech’s G Hub software is pretty easy to pick up too, and gives you the opportunity to adjust RGB lighting, profiles, and fine-tune performance settings like DPI.

##### Logitech G305 Lightspeed Mouse

Most Versatile

 A well-rounded experience with an accurate sensor

 $35$50 Save $15

 The Logitech G305 Lightspeed Mouse drops a flashy design for reliability, function, and performance. Though it uses batteries, a good set will keep it running for up to 250 hours.

**Pros**

* Lightweight, mechanical design
* Reliable wireless connection
* Fitted with Logitech's HERO optical sensor

**Cons**

* May feel too small if you have big hands

[$41 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CMS5Q6P?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$35 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g305-lightspeed-wireless-optical-6-programmable-button-gaming-mouse-with-12000-dpi-hero-sensor-black%2F6214343.p%3FskuId%3D6214343)

 Versatile, durable, and comfortable, the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Mouse is one of Logitech’s stand-out offerings. Even with its simple form factor, the mouse delivers unrivaled responsiveness. The mouse helps you grow into a better player, especially if you love playing first-person shooters.

 Its 12,000 DPI Optical Hero Sensor provides you with high-speed responsiveness and accuracy. The sensor also hits a maximum velocity of 400 IPS (inches per second), meaning the mouse can keep up with high-speed movements. This mouse is lightweight, weighing 99 grams, allowing you to maneuver across the surface effortlessly.

 Better yet, the chassis feels sturdy and has a matte finish that gives it a premium look. Next to the battery is a compartment that secures the dongle when traveling, ensuring you don’t lose your lightning-speed connection. The mouse comes in four colors (black, lilac, blue, and white), allowing you to choose an option that looks attractive to you and fits with your desktop setup.

##### Logitech G705

Most Compact

Smaller fit for daintier hands

 $78$100 Save $22

 Just because your hands are tiny doesn't mean you can't join in on the fun, not while the Logitech G705 exists. It has the right amount of tactile feedback, performance, and weight for a wide variety of gaming genres.

**Pros**

* Up to 40 hours of battery life (and rechargeable)
* Two extra buttons on the side
* Can connect with 2 separate compatible devices
* Has an adorable, yet comfortable design

**Cons**

* Right-handed only
* Side buttons need to be a little wider

[$78 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V1JWV82?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-logitech-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$80 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g705-aurora-collection-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-customizable-lightsync-rgb-lighting-white-mist%2F6511295.p%3FskuId%3D6511295)

 Baby hands, small, dainty—however you'd describe your hands, those tiny mittens of yours might have trouble getting a grip on even average-sized gaming mice. They're cumbersome and too unwieldy, and the weight makes it feel off-balance. It makes a world of difference when you switch to a much smaller gaming mouse, like the Logitech G705.

 Given the dimensions of the Logitech G705, it’s significantly smaller than the average computer mouse by a good two to three inches. The upper half is stubbier, giving you just the right amount of reach to click the mouse buttons at the edge rather than the middle. Additionally, the two extra thumb buttons are tactile and easily reached, though they could have been a tad longer.

 No doubt, the best part of the Logitech G705 is its performance. It’s quite snappy and responsive, so you’ll have no problem enjoying first-person shooters. However, it has just the right amount of weight—85 grams—to give you some control.

## Picking the Best Logitech Gaming Mouse For You

 In this day and age, finding the right gaming mouse has gotten a lot simpler. Prioritizing performance hasn't changed, but you also want to consider features like extra buttons or how accommodating a gaming mouse is to certain grips.

 For that reason, the Logitech G502 X Plus Lightspeed is our undisputed champ. The HERO 25K optical sensor is a slam dunk in the performance department, and it goes above and beyond with its extra buttons, like the "sniper" button. It's also rather pleasing to the eyes.

 If you're on a shoestring budget, the Logitech G203 is the next best thing, especially if you aren't married to a single game genre. There's a bit of RGB, the design is comfortable, and you get six programmable buttons. Additionally, you can crank the DPI up to 8000 and even adjust the sensitivity.
