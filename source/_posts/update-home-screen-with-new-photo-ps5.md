 While you can[change the background wallpaper on your PS4](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-ps4-wallpaper/) , the background on your PS5 depends on what game or menu icon you have selected. These automatic backgrounds can't be changed and will alternate according to which menu item you have selected.

![media gallery selected on ps5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/media-gallery-selected-on-ps5.jpg)

 For example, when I hover over Baldur's Gate 3, the background changes to the game's cover art. When I hover over another title, the background changes again.

 You can change the background or cover image of your PS5 profile, but this doesn't show up on the main console home screen. You will have to visit your profile to see this image.

## Can You Use PS5 Themes?

 Again, unlike the PS4, you can't get themes for the PS5\. Hopefully, the feature will roll out in the future so that users have a bit more customization available.

 However, you do have some options to customize your profile on the PS5.

## How to Change Your PS5 Profile Background

 When it comes to adding some customization to your PS5, you can change certain aspects of your profile. This includes your profile picture or avatar and the background of your profile.

 To edit your profile, go to the PS5 home screen and select your avatar in the top right corner. From the drop-down menu that appears, select**Profile** .

![ps5 home screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ps5-home-screen.jpg)

 This will take you to your profile page, which is visible to you and your friends, depending on your privacy settings.

 To begin editing your profile, select the**pen icon** on the right. This will take you to a menu where you can select which aspect of your profile you would like to change.

 To change your profile background, select**Cover Image** .

![changing your profile background on the ps5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/changing-your-profile-background-on-the-ps5.jpg)

 Once you have changed your background to your liking, select**Done** .

 If you want to customize your profile further, such as[changing your PS5 profile avatar](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-ps5-profile-picture-avatar-cover-image/) , you can go back to the edit menu and select**Profile Picture** . There you can choose to use a pre-made avatar or upload a profile picture through the PS App.

 If you select the Avatar option in the edit menu, you can choose between several avatars that you receive from your games, as well as some default avatars from Sony.

 While these customization options are limited, they can offer you a way to make your PS5 user interface stand out a little bit more. Hopefully, Sony introduces more customization options in the future so that PS5 backgrounds aren't so limited.
