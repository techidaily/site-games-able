![TIMOVO Lens Protector & Controller Silicone Pads](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timovo-lens-protector-controller-silicone-pads.png)

_TIMOVO_

 Protect your PSVR2 lenses and get a grip (or a better one, at least) with this TiMOVO PSVR2 Lens Protector and Controller Pads set. The lens protectors have been cut to match the PSVR2’s measurements and are made from soft silicone to ensure a scratch-free fit. A sponge cushion sits inside the lens protector to provide extra reinforcement.

 Two sets of soft silicone pads are included to supply extra comfort and grip on your VR controllers, which have a nano glue coating on their backs. This keeps the pads firmly in place and allows for easy and mark-free removal that won’t damage the controllers. The pads themselves are anti-slip and anti-sweat, too.

 This TiMOVO PSVR2 set is a handy way to keep lenses and surfaces clean and protected, and well worth considering for PSVR2 gamers.

_Sony_

 While the PSVR2 package will include a pair of earbuds, the design of the headset itself is such that it also supports the use of wireless headphones as well. Many gamers prefer wearing headphones rather than earbuds, as the audio experience they provide is arguably more immersive. Having been designed specifically for the PlayStation 5, Sony’s Pulse 3D Wireless Headset is the go-to headset for PS5 gamers.

 Fine-tuned for 3D audio on the PS5, the Pulse 3D is equipped with dual noise-canceling microphones that provide crystal-clear voice capture. Soft and comfortable on the ears, this headset allows for easy switch-up between audio modes for solo gameplay and voice chat. And on a full charge, you can enjoy 12 hours of wireless play.

 The Pulse 3D Wireless Headset is the perfect companion for the PSVR2 and the best way to enjoy the huge library of VR-compatible games that are heading to PS5.

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need a PS5 to use the PSVR2?

 Yes. The PSVR2 isn't a self-contained VR headset, unlike some of the other alternatives on the market. This means it needs to be paired with a PS5 console for you to use it.

### Q: Can I play PSVR1 games on the PSVR2?

 Unfortunately, and as confirmed by Sony prior to the PSVR2's launch, the PSVR2 isn't backward compatible. This means that you won't be able to use it to play any of your PSVR games.

### Q: What kind of display does the PSVR2 have?

 The PSVR2's display consists of a dual OLED panel with a 4K display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 pixels per eye. It has a refresh rate of 120Hz and also supports HDR.

### Q: How do I prevent motion sickness with VR games?

 Extended VR gameplay can tend to induce motion sickness for the user. This can be reduced by taking regular breaks and ensuring each gameplay session has a time limit on it.

 The effects of motion sickness in VR can also be lessened by sitting instead of standing, ensuring that you're using your headset in a well-ventilated area, and by adjusting the VR settings on your headset.

### Q: Can I play VR games with glasses?

 Yes, the PSVR2 has been designed to accommodate users who wear glasses as well as those who don't. The headset itself is fully adjustable, so you should be able to find a comfortable fit while you're immersed in VR.

 There are also a variety of glasses inserts that you can buy for the PSVR2, which can provide additional comfort for glasses users, as well as an additional layer of protection for your lenses.
