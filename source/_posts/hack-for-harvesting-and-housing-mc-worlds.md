## Hack for Harvesting and Housing MC Worlds

 Playing Minecraft can be a fantastic outlet for your creativity. However, the game can start to feel a little stale and repetitive after a while. One way that you can resolve this is by installing new Minecraft maps. These maps are easy to find, and they make playing Minecraft feel fresh again.

 Let's explore the best places to download Minecraft maps and how you can install them on your Minecraft copy.

## What Are Minecraft Maps?

 Minecraft maps are basically the same as Minecraft worlds: custom virtual environments made by fellow Minecraft players. These maps can range from pixel-art statues to parkour challenges or even an entire city ripe with fun things to explore.

 Once players create a new Minecraft map, they can share their creations with the community. You can then download and install these awesome maps to explore them.

## How to Download Minecraft Maps

 Before downloading and installing Minecraft maps, you need to determine which version of Minecraft you have. Keep in mind that Bedrock maps aren't compatible with Java versions of Minecraft.

 Once you've verified your version, you can download maps from the websites listed below. Minecraft maps come in one of two file formats: .zip or .mcworld.

* **.zip file** : .zip files are used to share maps created in the Java edition of Minecraft. The .zip file contains the assets related to loading the map in-game. Bedrock editions of the game (Windows 10, iOS, Android) also formerly used .zip files. A great source for zip maps is the[Minecraft Maps](https://www.minecraftmaps.com/) website.
* **.mcworld file** : The .mcworld extension stores all map-related assets in a single file. To install a .mcworld map, simply double-click on it. You can find .mcworld maps on the[MCPEDL](https://mcpedl.com/tag/mcworld/) fan site, along with skins, seeds, texture packs, and mods for Minecraft.

 Once you've downloaded your new Minecraft maps, it's time to install them.

## How to Install Minecraft Maps on Windows (Java)

![New mods make Minecraft amazing](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/muo-gaming-minecraft-mountain.jpg)

 To use your new map file, you'll need to place it in the correct directory. Here's how you can do that for Minecraft Java on Windows:

1. Extract the .zip file you've downloaded.
2. Copy the**map folder** by highlighting it and pressing**Ctrl + C** on your keyboard.
3. On your keyboard, press**Win + R** to open the Windows**Run** app.  
![Using Run to open the appdata directory.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/minecraft-run-appdata-1.jpg)
4. In the text box, type**%appdata%** and press**Enter** to open the**C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming** directory.

5. In the**Roaming** directory, find the folder labeled**.minecraft** . Inside, you'll find a folder labeled**saves** . This is where Minecraft stores its maps.
6. Open the**saves** folder and paste the map folder inside. That's it!

### Alternate Method

 If you want to avoid using the Run app, you can also access the Minecraft saves folder through the Minecraft Launcher. Here's how:

1. First, copy the map folder as before.
2. Open**Minecraft Launcher** .
3. Under**Minecraft: Java Edition** , click the**Installations** tab.
4. Hover over**Latest Release** and click the folder icon to open the Minecraft installation directory.
5. Navigate to the**saves** folder.
6. Paste the map folder.

 To explore your downloaded world, launch Minecraft in single-player mode. You should see your map there. Click the map to load it, and once everything loads, start exploring!

 Installing Minecraft maps on Android is also simple, thanks to the new .mcworld extension. All you need to do is open the map file, and it should automatically launch in Minecraft.

 Older Minecraft maps, on the other hand, might use the traditional .zip format. To install these, you'll have to unpack the zip files and paste them into the minecraftWorlds folder. If your Android device's file manager can't unpack zip files, you can try other[free Android file managers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-best-file-explorers-android/) like Files by Google.

**Download** : Files by Google for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2000389/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) (Free)

Here's how you can install older Minecraft maps on Android:

1. Open the Files by Google app on your Android device.
2. Navigate to your Minecraft map file.
3. Click on the .zip file and select**Extract** . You should now see a folder containing the Minecraft map.
4. Copy the Minecraft map folder.
5. Navigate to the root directory and then to**games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds.**
6. Paste the map folder.

 Done! Your Minecraft map should now show up in the game. Alternatively, you could also skip having to navigate on your phone by[moving the files from your computer to your Android device](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-to-get-data-from-your-desktop-to-your-android/) .

## How to Install Minecraft Maps on iOS (Bedrock)

![Person playing Minecraft on an iPhone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/minecraft-ios-map.jpg)

 Like other Bedrock editions, if your downloaded map uses the .mcworld extension, all you have to do is run it, and Minecraft will load the new map.

 If you have an older map in a .zip format, you'll need to convert it to a .mcworld file. This consists of[extracting the zip file on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/open-zips-compressed-archives-iphone-ipad/) and compressing its content as a .mcworld file.

1. Open the map file.
2. Extract the files.
3. Open the map folder and select all files and folders.
4. Tap**More** and then select**Compress** .
5. Find the Archive.zip file and rename it to change the extension to**.mcworld** (Map.mcworld, for example).
6. Next, tap the**.mcworld** file you just created. Then tap**Open in another app** and select**Minecraft** . The new world should load now!

 You should see your new map under the Worlds heading. Tap it, and select the new world to explore it!

 If the steps in this method seem inconvenient, you can prime the files on your PC and then[transfer the files from your PC to your iPhone or iPad](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/transfer-files-wirelessly-computers-ios-devices-fileapp/) .
