 Many independent game developers display their fun, creative, and unique experiences on itch.io. However, the platform’s saturation can make it hard to find great titles. Try these methods I use to discover indie games worth playing on itch.io.

## 1 Use Tags and Filters

 On itch.io, you can use various tags and filters to find great indie games. I am a big fan of [roguelite video games](http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-roguelike-and-roguelite-video-games/) , so I use the**Roguelite** tag to ensure I only see the relevant results.

 On the itch.io homepage, you will find the frequently used tags in the**Popular Tags** section on the left. But if you want to search for a particular tag, click the**Browse All Tags** link.

![The itch.io homepage.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itch-io-home-page.png)

 Click the**Find Tag** dropdown in the top-right corner and select the tag you want (e.g.,**2D** ,**Platformer** ,**Action** ,**Puzzle** ,**Horror** ,**Visual** **Novel** , and**Adventure**).

![Searching for the tags on itch.io.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/search-indie-tag-itch.png)

 You can add more tags to refine your search further. To do that, click the**Select a Tag** dropdown and choose the tags you want (you can also search for them).

![Adding tags to a search on itch.io.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/add-roguelite-tag-itch.png)

 The games will be sorted by what's popular, but to find the great games, I usually look at the**Top Rated** and**Top Sellers** tabs. This has led me to discover fun roguelites like [Corebreaker](https://aquadiun.itch.io/corebreaker) and [Xenopunch](https://overboy.itch.io/xenopunch) .

## 2 Check Out Game Bundles

 The itch.io website has a [Bundles page](https://itch.io/bundles) where you can find game bundles created by developers. These are promotional packages containing multiple games. Each bundle is sold at a discounted price, and when you purchase it, you get instant access to all the games.

## 3 Check the itch.io Blog

 The [itch.io blog](http://itch.io/blog) is a surprisingly good place to find sales and bundles of some great indie games. These promotions are curated based on various themes, such as winter, summer, Halloween, or Valentine's Day. The blog also highlights “Games of the Week,” where the team curates several great indie games for you to try.

## 4 Check Out Game Jams

 Game jams are a fantastic way to discover hidden gems for free. On itch.io, game jams take place throughout the year, so keep your eye on the [Game Jams page](https://itch.io/jams) to see upcoming events on the calendar. Look for past game jams to try highly rated game submissions.

![The page to see past game jams on itch.io.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/past-game-jams-itch.png)

 These game jams usually have creative and innovative indie games from different genres. Developers usually display talent in crafting unique experiences at these events. Fun games I have discovered through game jams on itch.io include [Inside Job](https://featurekreep.itch.io/inside-job) ,[Bready or not - unSURVIVOR](https://aramilion.itch.io/bready-or-not-unsurvivor) , and [Let There Be Cat](https://kyboon.itch.io/let-there-be-cat) .

 Since these are game jams, don't expect fully fleshed-out games with lots of content and complex features. Developers usually have time constraints and a limited scope to work with, as well as specific problems to solve. Many enter them to learn about game development and to tackle unique challenges.

## 5 Follow Developers

 If a particular indie developer has a game you like, you can follow them to stay updated on their latest releases. This allows you to see what games they have in their collections and those they have rated highly.

 Another way to discover developers to follow is by looking at your feed, which shows you recommendations based on your activity on itch.io. I usually switch to the**Featured Games Feed** or**Global Feed** tab to see what is trending based on my interests.

![The feed on itch.io showing featured games.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itch-feed-featured-games.png)

 Keep in mind that this feed doesn't only show games, but things like asset packs and comics as well.

## 6 Look at User Reviews and Ratings

 If you have a problem deciding whether a game is good, you can look at its rating. On the game’s itch.io page, scroll down past the description and click**More Information** . Here, you can see how many users rated the game (out of five stars).

![A game's page on itch.io showing more information so the rating can be seen.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/more-information-game-itch.png)

 You can also scroll down to the comments to see the sentiments around the game. Also, it can be a fantastic way to interact with the developer.

## 7 Check Out Community Recommendations

 The itch.io community has the [Recommend a Game page](https://itch.io/board/13293/recommend-a-game) . This is where people post games that they've enjoyed and why. It's a good place to see the discussion around the game, ask questions, and even find people and developers to follow.

 Keep in mind that itch.io is just one of the many platforms to find great indie games. You can also find them on Steam, PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Xbox Marketplace, Nintendo eShop, and others. And If you love itch.io for its free games, there's also a way to [find free games on Steam](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-free-games-on-steam/) .
