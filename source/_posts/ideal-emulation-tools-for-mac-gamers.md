## Ideal Emulation Tools for Mac Gamers

 Although macOS isn't for gamers, emulation allows you to enjoy a wide array of your beloved games, ranging from the latest Nintendo Switch titles to childhood classics from the Game Boy Advance era. Here, we'll list the top console emulators you can effortlessly use on your Mac, opening up a world of gaming possibilities that cater to all your preferences and nostalgia.

 While using emulators to play games is legal, downloading and installing ROMs for games you don't own is illegal.
