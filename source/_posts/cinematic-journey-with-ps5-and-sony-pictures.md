## How to Download and Use Sony Pictures Core on Your PS5

 Sony Pictures Core is a free app available to download on PS4 and PS5 consoles.

![the Media Tab on a PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/media-tab-ps5.jpg)

 Using Sony Pictures Core requires you to enable the HDCP settings on your PlayStation.[HDCP is different to HDMI](https://www.makeuseof.com/hdcp-vs-hdmi-whats-the-difference/) . It stands for High-Bandwidth Digital Copyright/Content Protection, and it prevents you from being able to stream or record content while you’re watching it on the app.

![Go to HDMI option on Sony Pictures Core PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/go-to-hdmi-sony-pictures-core-ps5.jpg)

 If your HDCP settings are enabled already, you will be able to launch and use Sony Pictures Core as normal. If not, an error screen will appear, prompting you to enable the settings before you can use the app. To enable HDCP, select**Go to HDMI** . Your PlayStation will direct you to the exact setting you need to change.

 Once you launch Sony Pictures Core, you will be required to make an account to gain access to the massive catalog of epic Sony Pictures movies. Creating an account is also free. Press**Get Started** to set it up.
