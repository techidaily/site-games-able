## Dissecting the Implications of Xbox's Controller Policy Limitations

### Key Takeaways

* Xbox bans "unauthorized" third-party controllers to ensure safety and quality control on its platform.
* If you connect an "unauthorized" controller to your Xbox, you will receive an error code and have two weeks to contact the manufacturer or seek a refund.
* You can still use a majority of third-party controllers that are involved in the Designed for Xbox program or feature an official Xbox logo.

 Third-party accessories can be a versatile and cheaper alternative to official console controllers. But with Xbox's ban on unofficial controllers and accessories, you'll likely want to know how you're affected as an Xbox owner. Let's take a look.

## Why Has Xbox Banned “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controllers?

 If you utilize third-party Xbox controllers, you'll want to know why Xbox restricts your accessory choices. However, Xbox's ban only affects "unauthorized" third-party controllers, as evidenced by [the official Xbox website](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/errors/error-code-0x82d60002) . All third-party accessories involved in the Designed for Xbox program are unaffected.

 As for why Xbox felt the need to ban "unauthorized" third-party accessories and controllers, there are a few main factors:

* Banning "unauthorized" third-party devices allows Xbox to ensure all controllers and accessories on its platform are part of the Designed for Xbox program and safe to use.
* Third-party providers of unofficial Xbox accessories can include devices like Cronus Zen that allow for or make cheating easier.

* By banning unofficial third-party devices, Xbox ensures you can only purchase official or Designed for Xbox accessories and controllers, which encourages Xbox sales.

 So, while there are sales incentives for Xbox, the ban itself acts to quality control the third-party controllers and accessories you can use on Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S.

 However, if you [connect an Xbox controller to your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/) , you can still use unofficial controllers for PC gaming, just not via an Xbox One or Series X|S.

## What Happens if You Use an “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controller

 While Xbox may have had good reason to ban unofficial third-party devices, you will still want to know how your devices are affected by the ban.

 Luckily, how Xbox bans "unauthorized" third-party devices provides you time to return your device or contact the manufacturer. So, regarding what happens if you connect an "unauthorized" third-party device to your Xbox, the process is as follows:

* If you connect an unauthorized controller or accessory to your Xbox console, you will receive the error code:**0x82d60002** .
* From the point of receiving error code**0x82d60002** , you have two weeks before your device is banned from being used with your Xbox.
* Xbox advises that within the two weeks time-frame, you contact the manufacturer of the device or return it to seek a refund.

 If you are unsure if your third-party device is "unauthorized", you can connect it to your Xbox. As long as you don't receive error code**0x82d60002** , you know you can carry on using your device as normal.

## What Third-Party Controllers Can You Still Use With Your Xbox?

 Even if your third-party devices receive error code**0x82d60002** , you don't have to abandon third-party Xbox controllers altogether. In fact, despite the ban, you can utilize a vast majority of third-party Xbox devices.

 Xbox still supports third-party devices involved in the Designed for Xbox program. But Xbox also highlights that any third-party controllers that feature an official Xbox logo between the left and right triggers should be useable on all Xbox consoles.

 As for identifying whether third-party devices are Designed for Xbox, you should look for the official Designed for Xbox logo when buying new devices. Alternatively, you can register your third-party devices via [the official Microsoft website](https://account.microsoft.com/devices?) to determine if your device is official.

 And you can still utilize [the best Xbox Wireless Controller tips and tricks](https://www.makeuseof.com/essential-xbox-controller-tips/) for use with most Designed for Xbox gamepads, maintaining functionality.

## Utilize Third-Party Devices on Xbox Without Compromising Your Console

 While Xbox's ban on unofficial third-party controllers and accessories restricts the devices you can use on Xbox, it does ensure the safety and security of your Xbox console and gaming experience.

 And with plenty of third-party devices being a part of the Designed for Xbox initiative, you can still utilize third-party devices, just so long as they are officially approved by Xbox.
