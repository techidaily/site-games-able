## 3 Ways to Redeem Digital Codes for Your Xbox

 Redeeming gift cards, digital content, or even entire games via digital codes can be a bit of a pain, especially when the process of doing so is hidden among a myriad of settings. On Xbox, this is no different.

 Fortunately, there are a few methods of redeeming your digital Xbox codes that involve using either your Xbox Series X|S, a web browser, or the Xbox app. So if you're wondering how to redeem a digital code for your Xbox, let's take a look at some of the easiest ways to do so.

## 1\. Redeem Your Xbox Digital Codes on Your Xbox Series X|S

 The most straightforward way to redeem a digital code for your Xbox account is to use your Xbox console. Generally, whether you want to [redeem Microsoft Reward Points from your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-redeem-microsoft-reward-points-on-xbox-series-xs/) , or simply redeem a digital code, doing so from your Xbox is the most direct method.

 To redeem a digital code straight from your Xbox Series X|S, then, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* From the main menu of the Guide, select the bottom option for**Store** .

 Your Xbox will then check the validity of your digital code. If the code is valid, you will then be able to select**Confirm** to unlock the associated content for your Xbox account.

## 2\. Use the Xbox App to Redeem Your Digital Codes on Windows

 While you can utilize your Xbox console to redeem digital codes, or even [redeem digital direct offers from your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-how-to-redeem-digital-direct-offers/) , you may not always have direct access to your console.

 In this case, it may be better for you to utilize your PC or laptop, and redeem your code through the Xbox app for Windows, available for free via [the official Xbox site](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) . With the Xbox app installed on your laptop or PC, you can redeem your digital code by following these steps:

* Load the Xbox app and sign into your Xbox account.
* Select your Xbox profile icon in the top-right of the Xbox application's home screen.
* Choose**Settings** .

* Under**Account** , select**Redeem** .

 As with redeeming a digital code from your Xbox Series X|S, if your code is valid you will then be able to confirm the associated digital content and unlock it for your Xbox account.

## 3\. How to Redeem Your Xbox Code From a PC or Mobile Browser

 A final way you can redeem your digital codes for your Xbox account is by accessing the Microsoft Store. This method is particularly useful if you don't have access to either your Xbox or the Xbox app for Windows. To redeem your digital code via the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

* Enter the**Redeem your code or gift card** page of the [Microsoft Store](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem?refd=account.microsoft.com) .
* Sign into the Xbox account you want to redeem the code for.
* Enter the digital code's unique 25-character code.
