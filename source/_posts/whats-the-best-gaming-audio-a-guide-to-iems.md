## What's the Best Gaming Audio? A Guide to IEMs

### Key Takeaways

* Gaming IEMs offer advantages such as portability, noise isolation, and clear voice communication for multiplayer, making them ideal for mobile gaming and on-the-go scenarios.
* However, compared to gaming headphones, IEMs lack spacious soundstage and their audio signature tends to be more neutral, resulting in a flatter sound.
* Choosing between IEMs and gaming headphones depends on priorities: immersive soundstage and tailored gaming audio favor headphones, while mobility, voice chat clarity, and noise isolation favor IEMs. Consider your specific gaming needs when selecting an IEM model.

 In-ear monitors, commonly known as IEMs, have become a popular audio choice for many gamers. But are dedicated gaming IEMs the right pick for your needs? Let's dive into the pros and cons of using IEMs for gaming and how they compare to traditional gaming headphones.

## What Are Gaming IEMs?

 In-ear monitors are a type of earphone that sit inside your ear canal, using silicone or foam ear tips to create a seal. The in-ear design provides excellent noise isolation, blocking out external sounds for an immersive listening experience. Many IEMs are also designed specifically for gaming, with features like surround sound, gaming mode for low latency, and built-in boom mics for voice chat.

 However, gaming IEMs haven't caught on like gaming earbuds, and especially not gaming headsets. If you head online and search for gaming headsets, you'll find countless reviews, recommendations, and options. In contrast, there are some good gaming IEMs, but only around a tenth of the choice. Simply put, the range of gaming IEMs isn't there, and that could be a direct reflection of the gaming audio market as a whole.

 Still, that hasn't stopped some of the biggest names in gaming audio from launching gaming IEMs, with brands like Razer, HyperX, and EPOS offering gaming-focused IEM models.

## Specs and Features to Check Before Buying Gaming IEMs

 Gaming IEMs and other headsets aren't so different. There is still a core set of specs and features to check out before you buy, many of which are similar to a regular gaming headset.

### Features

Your gaming IEMs need the following features:

* **Low latency** : Minimal delay between audio signal and sound reproduction for precise in-game reactions.
* **Detachable boom microphone** : For clear in-game voice chat and communications.
* **In-line controls** : Allows easy volume adjustment and muting without obstructing game controls.
* **Situational awareness** : Ability to blend in external sounds alongside game audio for safety.
* **Sound isolation** : Closed IEM design that blocks distracting ambient noise.
* **Customizable fit** : Interchangeable ear tips to get a secure, comfortable fit for long gaming sessions.
* **Durable construction** : Can withstand rugged gaming on the goâ€”reinforced cables and connectors (an [array of IEM connection options](https://www.makeuseof.com/types-of-iem-connectors/) would also be useful).

 Given most gaming IEMs are wired, low latency should be a given, but it's always worth checking beforehand.

### Specs

 Like the features, you'll want to [check out the following specs when buying gaming IEMs](https://www.makeuseof.com/in-ear-monitor-buying-guide/) .

* **Frequency response** : Extended bass and treble for exciting in-game effects. 10Hz to 25kHz is the ideal range, though most use standard 20Hz to 20KHz (the effective limits of human hearing).
* **Soundstage** : Precise channel separation and left/right imaging for directional audio cues.
* **Impedance** : Low impedance, from 16 to 32 ohms, for compatibility with mobile devices.
* **Sensitivity** : High sensitivity over 90dB for loud, powerful audio reproduction.
* **Drivers** : Multiple balanced armature drivers or dynamic drivers 10mm+ in size.
* **Battery life** : For wireless models, 8+ hours for uninterrupted gaming sessions.
* **Microphone type** : Omnidirectional or cardioid mic pattern for clear voice pickup.

 Aside from the specs and features, comfort is another factor when buying gaming IEMs. If they're not comfortable for long gaming sessions, there is no point in buying them.

## Gaming IEM Pros and Cons

 For many gamers, IEMs provide advantages over bulky gaming headsets. Their small, lightweight size makes IEMs highly portable and ideal for mobile gaming. The noise isolation lets you focus on game audio, even in loud environments. IEMs also occupy very little space, making them great for gaming in tight quarters or on the go. Many include detachable boom mics that enable clear voice communication for multiplayer.

 However, there are some potential downsides to choosing IEMs over headphones for gaming purposes. Their closed-in-ear design lacks the spacious, open soundstage many gaming headphones provide. This can limit your ability to pinpoint directional audio cues in games like first-person shooters accurately. The audio signature of IEMs also tends to be more neutral versus the boosted bass and lively treble of gaming headsets. This may result in a flatter, less exciting sound for some gamers.

 When comparing IEMs to dedicated gaming headphones, both have their merits. Large over-ear headphones surround your ears with big audio drivers, creating a wide dynamic range and crystal-clear positional audio. This lends itself well to experiencing a game's full immersive soundscape. Headphones crafted specifically for gaming also fine-tune the sound signature to accentuate important in-game frequencies like footsteps or reloads.

 On the other hand, the supreme noise isolation and portability of IEMs make them a superior choice in certain gaming scenarios. If you primarily game on the go with a Nintendo Switch or mobile phone, IEMs are far more practical and provide better listening privacy. For voice-chat-dependent team multiplayer games, many IEMs now integrate high-quality boom mics with gaming-optimized controls for balancing game and chat audio.

 Ultimately, choosing between IEMs and gaming headphones comes down to weighing your priorities. If immersive soundstage and tailored gaming audio are most important, over-ear headphones are a better pick. But if you value mobility, voice chat clarity, and noise isolation over an expansive cinematic experience, today's gaming IEMs can deliver.
