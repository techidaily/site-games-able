## Trouble With Xbox & PC: Reconnection Tips Inside

 Xbox Wireless Controllers are a quintessential gaming accessory that works just as well on Xbox as on PC. But that isn't to say you won't experience issues with your controller. If you're having trouble connecting your Xbox Wireless Controller to a PC, here are a few quick tips that may help.

## 1\. Update Your Xbox Wireless Controller on PC

 While you may frequently[update your Xbox Wireless Controller on your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-xbox-one-and-series-controllers/) , you can also update your controller through your PC. In instances where your controller won't connect to your PC, installing a PC Xbox Wireless Controller update can fix the issue.

 To update your Xbox Wireless Controller on your Windows PC, you need to install the Xbox Accessories application from the[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xbox-accessories/9NBLGGH30XJ3?hl=en-us&gl=US&rtc=1) . Once the Xbox Accessories app is installed on your PC, update your controller by following these steps:

 However, even if an update is unavailable, selecting**No update available** will still force the app to check your controller's firmware and install any inessential changes. Doing so may allow your Xbox Wireless Controller to connect to your PC or iron out any errant firmware causing the issue.

## 2\. Re-Pair Your Xbox Controller to Your PC

 While running a PC controller update can rectify your Xbox Wireless Controller not connecting to your PC, the method doesn't work if the Xbox Accessories app fails to pick up your controller, even through a USB. Moreover, it's not guaranteed that performing a controller update on a PC will fix your problem.

 However, if you have connected your Xbox Wireless Controller to your PC before, you can potentially fix connectivity issues by re-pairing your controller.

## 3\. Run the Windows Bluetooth Troubleshooter

## 4\. Restart Your Xbox Wireless Controller and PC

 Even if none of the above methods have helped your Xbox Wireless Controller connect to your PC, you can still try restarting your PC and controller. This may sound like a simple fix, but resetting your devices can often be exactly what's needed to fix tech issues.

 However, while it may be a simple process to reset your PC, resetting your Xbox Wireless Controller is less common. So, to reset your Windows PC and Xbox Wireless Controller, follow these steps:

* To restart your Windows PC, press the**Start** button to access the options under**Power** and select**Restart** .
* To restart your Xbox Wireless Controller, hold down the**Xbox button** for around 6 seconds. Once your controller turns off, wait a moment and press the**Xbox button** again to restart your controller.

 If your Xbox Wireless Controller still won't connect to your PC, a fault with your hardware may be the cause. In this case, you should see if other devices can connect to your PC.
