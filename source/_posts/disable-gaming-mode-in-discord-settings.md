## Disable Gaming Mode in Discord Settings

 Discord's overlay allows users to keep track of Discord activity while playing a game, even in full-screen mode. Whether you want to monitor newly received messages or get notifications for incoming calls, the overlay lets you stay on top of Discord communications without closing the game.

 The overlay is equally helpful for anyone looking to minimize the chances of missing an important text or call while gaming. Below, we'll show you how to enable or disable Discord's in-game overlay.

## How to Enable the Discord Overlay

 To use the Discord overlay in a game, you must enable the feature in Discord. The app must also recognize the game you want to use the overlay in.

To turn on the Discord overlay, follow these steps:

1. Click on the**gear icon (User Settings)** in the bottom-left corner.
2. Navigate to the**Game Overlay** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Turn on the toggle next to**Enable in-game overlay** .

 Right next to the toggle, you'll find a keyboard shortcut for turning the overlay on or off. If you want to change it, click on it and press the shortcut keys on your keyboard.

 After that, run the game you want to enable overlay for and minimize it. Then, navigate to the**Registered Games** tab in Discord settings and check whether the game is detected as being played. If it's there, click the monitor icon next to it to turn the overlay on.

## How to Use the Discord Overlay During Gaming

 Once you have enabled the overlay, you'll get a notification for every incoming text or call, even when playing the game in full screen.

 If you need to respond to a text or call, open the overlay window using the shortcut key. If you want to engage with a specific server or contact, you can pin the chat so that it always remains visible to you. To do this, open the overlay window and click the**pin icon** in the top-right corner.
