## Top Affordable Gamers' Keyboard Selection

 When it comes to building a budget gaming PC, you have to cut some corners somewhere, and keyboards are a fine place to start.

 Having a $150 pristine gaming keyboard sounds lovely, but more often than not, you can find an equally good keyboard for a third of the price. Budget-friendly gaming keyboards tend to focus on performance, which is all that really matters at the end of the day. You can then put those savings towards upgrades for your rig, like a better CPU or GPU. It's a win-win!

 Without further ado, here are the best budget gaming keyboards available right now.

![logitech-g413-keyboard-2](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/logitech-g413-keyboard-2.jpg)

##### Logitech G413

Best Overall

 Has the Looks, Performance, and Durability

 $52$70 Save $18

 The Logitech G413 fires on all cylinders with its durable aluminum top and mechanical Romer-G Tactile switches. It even has a handy USB passthrough for connecting peripherals.

**Pros**

* Durable, aluminum top case
* Romer-G Tactile mechanical switches
* 12 programmable keys via G Hub software
* Additional USB pass-through port

**Cons**

* Macros limited to function keys
* Lacks a wrist rest

[$55 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Full-Size-Mechanical-Anti-Ghosting-Keys-White/dp/B08Z6X4NK3/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002121&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-gaming-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$70 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-g413-wired-gaming-mechanical-romer-g-switch-keyboard-with-backlighting-carbon%2F5877911.p%3FskuId%3D5877911) [$52 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-G413-Backlit-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-with-USB-Passthrough-Carbon/583007950)

 This practical keyboard from Logitech is exactly why you don't have to spend twice as much on a fantastic gaming keyboard. The Logitech G413 has a nice, durable aluminum top (plastic underneath) and mechanical Romer-G Tactile switches. It even has a few essential features for gaming.

 Starting with the keys, the Romer-G Tactile switches are light to the touch and require very little to activate. And since they're mechanical, you'll feel the tactile feedback that's required to know you've pressed the key. With how fast these keys respond, it makes this perfect for gaming on a budget.

 The Logitech G413 also comes in handy when you've got a paper to write. Along with tactile mechanical keys, its 12 function keys are programmable via Logitech's proprietary G Hub software. More importantly, it has a 26-key rollover and anti-ghosting for improved performance.

##### Redragon K552

Best Value

Performance on a Budget

 The Redragon K552 finds a great balance between durability and performance, in addition to being a mechanical keyboard. It’s also compact, given its TKL layout.

**Pros**

* TKL keyboard layout
* Metal construction can take a beating
* Choice between Blue, Red, and Brown mechanical switches

**Cons**

* Additional features limited to function keys
* Lacks customization software

[$43 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019O9BLVY?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002121&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-gaming-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$44 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fredragon-kumara-k552-rgb-wired-tkl-gaming-mechanical-blue-switch-keyboard-with-rgb-backlighting-black%2F6458719.p%3FskuId%3D6458719) [$47 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Redragon-K552-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-RGB-LED-Backlit-Wired-with-Anti-Dust-Proof-Switches-for-Windows-PC-Black-87-Keys-Red-Switches/1841546059)

 For users who prefer durability and size above all, the Redragon K552 is a great choice without sacrificing performance. However, you will need to love the sound of Cherry MX Blue switches. They will click quite a bit, so it isn't recommended for populated areas. Its Cherry MX Blue equivalent switches feel and sound enchanting, but isn't ideal if you prefer something quieter.

 While other, more expensive, gaming keyboards may outperform this one in terms of latency, they don't require much of a press, resulting in quick responses if you press fast enough. And since the keys can take a beating, you can type away.

 Speaking of durability, the Redragon K552 is a pretty strong piece of hardware. It boasts a metal and ABS construction, with the keys themselves being plate-mounted, adding to the tactile feedback.

![corsair-k55-2](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/corsair-k55-2.jpg)

##### Corsair K55 RGB

Best IP Rating

For Those Prone to Tipping Drinks

 The Corsair K55 RGB is a rather robust membrane keyboard built for gaming. It’s also quite sturdy, featuring a dust and water-resistant rating of IP42.

**Pros**

* Good tactile feedback despite being membrane
* Easy-to-use Corsair iCUE macro software
* IP42-rated for dust and spill resistance
* Six programmable macro keys

**Cons**

* Limited to rubber dome switches

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M4LIKLI?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002121&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-gaming-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate)

 The Corsair K55 RGB feels like a complete package, the ideal keyboard gamers tend to think of when imagining the perfect companion for their PC. It has RGB backlighting, six macro keys, and a comfortable wrist rest. For lovers of RGB, you'll have three custom lighting zones to play around with. The lights can breathe, fade, pulse, or be turned off entirely. What's really nice is the ability to save those lighting profiles.

 Despite using rubber domes for switches, the Corsair K55 RGB has surprisingly good tactile feedback. It isn't as clicky as a mechanical keyboard, but there's still a fair bit of bump and great response. A good comparison would be softer MX Brown switches.

 Additionally, six macro keys are found on the left-hand side, which you can use Corsair's iCUE software to program. For a gaming setup, the Corsair K55 RGB is a fantastic solution for those on a budget.

##### SteelSeries Apex 3

Quietest Keys

 Not Everyone Likes the Clicking and Clacking of Keys

 The SteelSeries Apex 3 not only excels at gaming but keeps everything nice and quiet. It's the perfect option if you only game at night when everyone else is asleep.

**Pros**

* Quiet key press is perfect for nighttime gaming
* Comfortable wrist rest
* IP32 rating for water resistance

**Cons**

* No mechanical switches
* Doesn't have USB passthrough

[$50 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGDPT4M?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002121&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-gaming-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$62 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SteelSeries-Apex-3-RGB-Gaming-Keyboard-10-Zone-RGB-Illumination-IP32-Water-Resistant-Premium-Magnetic-Wrist-Rest-Whisper-Quiet-Gaming-Switch/921722537)

 For those wanting to casually game and type, the Steel Series Apex 3 is a tempting offer. It finds a nice compromise between switch latency, comfortability, and features. One example is the single clickable button in the top-right corner to control media. Despite not using mechanical switches, the membrane keys are still fairly responsive, though a step behind mechanical switches.

 The advantage here, however, is that the keys produce far less sound. If you tend to game at night, when others are asleep, this is a fine option. In addition to good switches, it has great durability. Its magnetic wrist rest is comfortable and easily removable. More importantly, it has an IP32 water resistance rating.

 The Rosewill Neon K85 RGB offers excellent gaming performance on a budget, specifically with the switches and their feedback. On top of performing well, it holds its own with the build quality, nicely utilized backlighting, and good software support.

 Starting with its switching, the Rosewill Neon K85 RGB uses Kailh Blue switches. They're known for fast actuation and tactile feedback, and they do not disappoint. It does fine for typing, but it'll feel wonderful for gaming. There's also good software support for customizing keys, profile settings, and even macro recordings.

 Sturdy and tough, the Rosewill Neon K85 RGB has an aluminum build, giving it longevity, a premium look, and a sleek design. The RGB lighting, in particular, is quite vibrant, with many customization options available.

 The magic comes from HyperX’s mechanical switches, which feature a short travel time and require very little force to actually press. That combination makes the HyperX Alloy Origins 60 incredibly responsive and a must-have when gaming gets intense. The HyperX Alloy Origins 60 can also take quite the beating. Given its aircraft-grade aluminum casing, it is resistant to bending and gives the keyboard quite a long lifespan.

##### ROCCAT Magma

 A Comfortable Gaming Experience With Flair

 With a solid response and comfortable wrist rest, the ROCCAT Magma is perfectly suited for gaming as much as it is typing. It even earns bonus points for its stylish layout.

**Pros**

* Surprisingly responsive for a membrane keyboard
* 26-key rollover
* Comfortable detachable wrist rest
* Good spacing between the keys

**Cons**

* Can only save one profile
* Wrist rest adds a fair bit of width

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ROCCAT-Membrane-Ergonomic-Detachable-Compatible/dp/B093MH824D?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002121&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-gaming-keyboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$59 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ROCCAT-Magma-Silent-Membrane-Switch-PC-Gaming-Keyboard-with-5-Zone-10-LED-AIMO-RGB-Top-Plate-and-Detachable-Palm-Rest-Black/602085349)

 If you game for hours on end, or even casually, the ROCCAT Magma just might be your next best friend. Not only does it double as a fashion piece for your rig, but the keyboard as a whole is quite a comfortable experience.

 For starters, the ROCCAT Magma’s wrist rest is among the most pleasant to use. It’s not overly bulky, allowing your palms and wrists to rest more level with your hands. Got your own wrist rest? No problem! The wrist rest is detachable, too.

 On top of support for your wrist and palms, the ROCCAT Magma has good spacing between the keys. Combined with the keyboard’s membrane design, the softness of the key presses is a soothing experience for some when it comes to typing.

##### Razer Ornata V3 X

Lowest Profile

 Silent Keys and a Low Profile Keyboard From a Trusted Brand

 $35$40 Save $5

 The Razer Ornata V3 X gets the reward of the "most bizarre" keyboard, given its mechanical-membrane hybrid switches. It creates an experience that's both clicky and soft to the touch.

**Pros**

* Very low profile
* Mecha-membrane switches
* Soft, detachable wrist rest
* Ergonomic design

**Cons**

* Wrist rest adds a bit of width
* More suited for casual gaming than competitive

 Mixing keyboards and wrist rests typically leads to one or the other being too low or bulky. The problem is that wrist rests are very useful for providing comfort to your wrists, especially when you're gaming. Luckily, the Razer Ornata V3 X takes all the guesswork out of this dilemma.

 The Razer Ornata V3 X is the entire package. It features a detachable wrist rest, one that's quite soft to the touch. More importantly, it's designed to level with the keyboard itself, providing a great deal of support to your wrists and palms without forcing you to bend at odd angles.

 You'll need that support for all the gaming you'll be doing with the Razer Ornata V3 X. Did you think it was just for typing? Sure, its mecha-membrane switches are perfectly suited for typing, but they're equally useful for gaming. They give the clicky feedback of a mechanical switch with the softness of a membrane keyboard.

## Choosing the Right Budget Gaming Keyboard For You

 Finding the right budget gaming keyboard is actually quite simple. Since they're usually stripped of many bells and whistles, all you really need to worry about is performance. It also wouldn't hurt to consider the type of switches you want—membrane or mechanical. The latter is almost always superior for typing and gaming.

 For that reason, the Logitech G413 is the overall best choice as it strikes a nice balance between cost, performance, and features. It has a full layout, great durability, and a myriad of mechanical switch types to choose from.

 If you love stretching your bottom dollar, then it's the Redragon K552 you want. It's a surprisingly durable TKL keyboard, and Redragon even gives you a choice between Blue, Brown, and Red mechanical switches.
