## How to Change Steam Language for a Specific Game

 If you share your Steam account with other people, it might make sense to change the default language for individual games. To do so, right-click the game you want to change the language for and select**Properties** . Then, in the**General** tab, use the drop-down menu next to**Language** to select your preferred option.
