## Unveiling the Mechanics of Roblox's Frame Rate Hacking

 Do you struggle to get high FPS in Roblox, and your gameplay keeps lagging most of the time? If so, you should try boosting the FPS by closing other resource-intensive processes, optimizing your in-game display settings, getting a more stable internet connection, and upgrading your system hardware.

 If these attempts don't improve your FPS, you can try a less-known method to make Roblox run faster: using a Roblox FPS Unlocker.

 Below, we'll describe what the FPS unlocker is, how you can set it up, and whether it is safe to use.

## What Is Roblox FPS Unlocker, and How Does It Work?

 Roblox caps the FPS at 60 by default. That means that no matter how powerful your device is, the frame rate won't surpass 60; it will always remain around this mark. If you are used to playing games at high frames per second, 60 FPS may not provide the experience you want.

 The Roblox FPS unlocker is designed to unlock this limitation, allowing the FPS to go higher than 60\. With this limitation removed, you might be able to get more than 100 frames per second, depending on how powerful your device is. Consequently, you will notice a significant performance boost. (Check out an in-depth explanation of[what FPS means in gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-fps-meaning/) )

 The Roblox FPS Unlocker removes the frame rate cap that prevents Roblox from going beyond 60 FPS. So, it's only useful if your device is powerful enough to deliver more than 60 frames per second. Otherwise, using the unlocker would be pointless.

4. Go to the**FPS Cap** menu, and select any value higher than**60** .

5. Restart Roblox.

 Once you follow these steps, hopefully, you won't be restricted to 60 FPS anymore, and it will go as high as your device is capable of.

 Many users have reported on[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/otk7kg/i%5Fthink%5Fthe%5Fnew%5Froblox%5Ffps%5Funlocker%5Fhas%5Fmalware/) ,[Opera](https://forums.opera.com/topic/61909/roblox-fps-unlocker-blocked-for-virus) , and other public forums that Windows sometimes blocks the unlocker's operation and, in extreme cases, uninstalls it completely.

## Can You Get Banned for Using Roblox FPS Unlocker?

 The Roblox FPS Unlocker is designed to turn off the frame limiter and VSync in Roblox. Technically, it doesn't alter game files or give users an unfair advantage. Because of this, Roblox allows users to use it. During a live video stream on[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNzFsJlFbo) , the VP of Engineering at Roblox clarified that unlocking FPS in this manner is not considered suspicious.

 Having explored forums and reading feedback from users who have been using this software for quite some time, it sounds like Roblox FPS Unlocker is safe to use.

## Remove the FPS Cap in Roblox

 While using the dedicated software to boost Roblox FPS is a great way to prove performance, there are many other possible ways to optimize it further.
