## Exploring PS5 Slim: Crucial Upgrades Exposed

### Key Takeaways

* Sony is releasing a "Slim" model of the PlayStation 5 in November 2023, which is smaller and more compact than the original models.
* The "Slim" models are slimmer and lighter than previous models, with a glossy finish on the top and a matte finish on the bottom.
* The "PS5 Slim" will cost between $449.99 and $499.99 and will be available in the US first, with rollout to other countries happening in "the following months".

 Sony has released slim models of its games consoles for years, beginning with the PS2\. And the company is continuing the trend with the PlayStation 5, releasing a "Slim" model just in time for the 2023 holiday season. It should be noted however, that Sony isn't officially branding this as a PS5 Slim.

## The "PS5 Slim" Is Arriving In November 2023

 Since the PlayStation 5 launched in 2019, you have had two options. The physical edition, which is a bit pricier but holds a disc tray as past consoles have, or the digital edition, which is cheaper but doesn't feature a disc tray.

 Now, as announced on [the PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/?sf269561474=1) , there's going to be a new model for both versions; which is smaller and more compact with an optional disc-drive add-on. Launching in November 2023 in the US, you can expect to purchase this from select retail stores (to be announced closer to the date) as well as from [direct.playstation.com](http://direct.playstation.com) .

 If you're not in the US, you'll have to wait a little longer to get your hands on one of these new, slimmer PS5s. Sony has announced that it will be rolling out the new PS5 model to other countries in "the following months", but the wording is deliberately vague.

## How Is the "PS5 Slim" Different From the Standard Model?

 If you're in the market for a PlayStation 5 or want to upgrade your current PS5, you may be wondering how the "Slim" is different.

 Well, as anticipated, the headline difference is that the "Slim" models are much slimmer and lighter than the previous models. The new model has 30% less volume than the two previous models, and weighs 18% less than the original digital model and 24% less than the original regular model.

 There is also an optional additional product, the Ultra-HD Blu-ray disc drive, which can add on to the digital version so that you can watch your favorite Blu-rays. There's also a glossy finish on the top, with the bottom remaining in the matte style as the original models.

## When Can You Expect the "PS5 Slim"?

 As previously noted, the "PS5 Slim" is launching in the US in November 2023, with rollout to other countries happening in "the following months". There are many [reasons why the PlayStation 5 should be your next console](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-ps5-should-be-your-next-console/) , and if you're buying one, you may as well buy the latest model.

 Depending on the model you go for, the "PS5 Slim" will cost between $449.99 and $499.99, which is similar in price to what the original models launched at.

## The "PS5 Slim" Is the Newest Console on the Block

 If you haven't already got a PlayStation 5, news of a newer, slimmer model arriving just in time for the 2023 holidays is great. That is as long as the supply issues that plagued the original models upon release aren't repeated.
