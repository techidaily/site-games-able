## Steam's Year in Review Is Now Available

 The Steam Year in Review dropped for all users on December 19, 2023, via an announcement on the[Steam Blog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/steam/?emclan=103582791457287600&emgid=3877100446784043483) . The 2023 Steam Year in Review compiles your stats, achievements, and more information about games you played on the platform.

 Steam released this report as Steam Replay 2022 in late December 2022, and it's doing it again in 2023\. However, Steam changed the name from Steam Replay to Steam Year in Review, and it's also releasing the report about two weeks earlier than last year.

 Once you've seen your report, you can share it on social media and other platforms. You can also[check out your Steam Replay 2022](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-see-steam-replay-2022/) and compare how your gaming habits changed over the year.

 If you had opened the Steam app between December 19 and 21, 2023, you would have seen the Year in Review banner at the top of the store page. However, if you missed that, you can still see the banner if you scroll down a bit during December 2023.

 But if you missed the banner and can't find it, you should see the report announcement in your Steam-registered email, provided you did not unsubscribe to Steam's email newsletter or[block emails on Gmail](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/block-emails-gmail/) .
