## RTX 4070 Ti Super vs. RTX 4070 Super vs. RTX 4080 Super Compared

 Nvidia chose CES 2024 to unveil the latest updates to its 4000-Series GPUs: The RTX 4070 Ti Super, the RTX 4070 Super, and the RTX 4080 Super. It's the first time Nvidia has launched new GPUs with its "Super" branding, as while there were numerous rumors that the RTX 3000 Series would receive a refresh, it never came.

 The new GPUs bring decent upgrades to Nvidia's existing lineup, and while they're still pricey, they're very much worth considering as your next GPU upgrade, especially if you're using an older GPU.

 Let's compare the specs of the RTX 4070 Ti Super, RTX 4070 Super, and RTX 4080 Super, along with the original models.

### Specs

 As you can see from the table, the new GPUs receive a performance bump over the original RTX 4070 and RTX 4080\. However, the performance boost isn't uniform, with the new RTX 4070 Super and Super Ti getting a bigger upgrade than the new RTX 4080 Super.

 The RTX 4080 Super receives a minute 50MHz bump to its clock speed, rising to 2,550MHz, a small increase in the number of CUDA cores, and no notable changes elsewhere. The biggest difference between the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super is the price, which we'll come to in a moment.

 It's a different story for the RTX 4070 Super and Super Ti, with both new 4070 GPUs receiving larger performance boosts.

 The RTX 4070 Super brings a significantly higher number of CUDA cores, rising from 5,888 to 7,168.[CUDA cores are specialized GPU hardware](https://www.makeuseof.com/nvidia-cuda-cores-vs-tensor-cores-whats-the-difference/) responsible for processing and rendering, and the increase should deliver a decent performance boost for the RTX 4070 Super. On top of that, the 4070 Super receives a slight power draw increase, rising to 220W from 200W.

 Similarly, the RTX 4070 Super Ti receives a further boost, with its CUDA cores rising to 8,448\. Importantly, the 4070 Super Ti also has 16GB memory, rising from 12GB, while its memory bus also rises to 256-bit (bringing it in line with the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super). The 4GB memory increase and wider memory bus should see the RTX 4070 Super Ti deliver a hefty performance boost over the original RTX 4070 (as well as the RTX 4070 Ti, which is already on the market).

### Price to Performance

 The [RTX 4080 launched in 2022](https://www.makeuseof.com/nvidia-rtx-4080-reasons-upgrade/) , priced around $1,199—the highest figure ever for one of Nvidia's "80" tier cards. Even allowing for inflation between the launch of the RTX 3080 in 2020 (around $699), the sky-high pricing put many would-be buyers off.

 Now, Nvidia is dropping the price of the RTX 4080 Super to $999\. It's still an expensive outlay; there's no escaping that, but the performance boost and price drop make the new RTX 4080 Super more palatable.

 But the price drops stop there. The RTX 4070 Super and Super Ti will launch at the same prices as the non-Super predecessors, coming in at $600 and $800, respectively. Given the performance upgrade for both GPUs, the lack of a price drop doesn't seem problematic, as you'll get more bang for your buck.

## Should You Upgrade to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, RTX 4070 Super, or RTX 4080 Super?

 If you haven't upgraded from an older GPU, like the RTX 3000 or RTX 2000 Series (or an older AMD GPU), Nvidia's GPU upgrades present a good opportunity.

 Dropping the price of the RTX 4080 Super to $999 is a good move, but it's hard to escape that it remains an extremely expensive GPU. Whereas the RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super look like a much better proposition, especially the RTX 4070 Ti Super at $800\. While absolute performance benchmarks aren't available until the GPUs launch later in January 2024, they're certain to bring a boost, which can only be a boon for gamers.
