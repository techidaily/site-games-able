## 1\. Call of Duty: Mobile

 Call of Duty has an exclusive mobile game which some claim is better than the COD games available on consoles.

 Call of Duty: Mobile features several modes. The most popular is the Battle Royale mode, which features a full-sized map. 100 players drop into the map and gather weapons and materials. The last person standing wins the match.

 There are also classic Deathmatch modes offered, and you can even play on your favorite legacy maps like Nuketown or Shipment.

 However, it is important to know that some advanced players actually play in 30FPS anyway, as they claim it makes it easier to find other players. So who knows, maybe playing on your phone will make you a better player.

 Playing Fortnite on iPhone requires cloud gaming, and while you can download it to Android devices, cloud gaming is recommended.

## Improve Your Mobile Games With Controller Support

 If you enjoy gaming on your iPhone or Android device, then you might want to consider taking your gaming to the next level and getting a controller. Not only does it improve gameplay, but in some cases it can actually make you better at the game.

 If you’re used to playing on consoles, you can also get a controller to improve your overall experience. Using a controller also lets you see the whole screen, as opposed to using your fingers which can block some aspects of the game.
