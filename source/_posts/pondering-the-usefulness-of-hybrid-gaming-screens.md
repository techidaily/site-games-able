### Key Takeaways

* Dual-mode monitors offer two refresh rates at different resolutions, allowing gamers to switch between a high resolution and a high refresh rate.
* The advantage of a dual-mode monitor is the option to have a refresh rate as high as 480Hz, which is beneficial for competitive gamers.
* Before purchasing a dual-mode monitor, consider if you can tell the difference between refresh rates and if your hardware can support the monitor's capabilities. It is not necessary for all gamers.

 In 2024, several manufacturers released "dual-mode" gaming monitors, allowing users to enjoy high refresh rates and resolutions on the same screen. But what exactly is a "dual-mode" monitor? And do you really need one for gaming and entertainment?

## What Is a Dual-Mode Monitor?

 A dual-mode monitor is a display that offers two refresh rates at different resolutions. For example, the 32-inch ROG Swift OLED, which [Asus unveiled at CES 2024](https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-monitors/rog-swift-oled-pg39wcdm-pg32ucdp-pg27aqdp/) , allows users to switch between 4K@240Hz or 1080p@480Hz.[LG also announced](https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2023/12/lg-ultragear-unveils-worlds-first-4k-oled-gaming-monitor-with-dual-hz-feature/) the UltraGear 32GS95UE around the same time, featuring the same technology.

 Dual-mode monitors allow gamers to switch between an ultra-high resolution mode or an ultra-fast monitor refresh rate, allowing you to enjoy the best of both worlds if you're a competitive gamer.

## What Is the Advantage of a Dual-Mode Monitor?

[LG](http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2023/12/lg-ultragear-unveils-worlds-first-4k-oled-gaming-monitor-with-dual-hz-feature/)

 The most significant advantage of a dual-mode monitor is getting a screen with a refresh rate as high as 480Hz. This is great for competitive gamers and esports players, where [monitor refresh rates matter](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/60hz-vs-144hz/) every second of the match.

 However, high-refresh rates are taxing to computer resources, especially if you don't have [a high-end graphics card](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-high-end-graphics-card-how-much-do-they-cost/) . Furthermore, most monitors with a refresh rate greater than 300Hz only have resolutions of 1440p or lower. That's why you only get a 1080p resolution at the maximum refresh rate setting with the current crop of dual-mode monitors.

 But at 32 inches or greater, the 1920x1080 resolution used at 480Hz does not offer a sharp and crisp image. This means you will not get the optimal experience when using your computer for other tasks like watching a movie or playing less intensive, more relaxing games.

 Pressing a button on the dual-mode monitor gives you a higher 3840x2160 pixel resolution, although at a much lower 240Hz. With this, you get the sharpness and crispness of a UHD display while still retaining a fast refresh rate.

 Combining these two modes into a single display means you don't need separate monitors for your daily and gaming needs, allowing you to save space on your desk.

## Should You Buy a Dual-Mode Monitor?

 While the dual-mode monitor is an exciting piece of technology, the question most gamers will ask is: do you really need it to be a better gamer?

 Before pouring money into this likely expensive piece of equipment, you must determine if you can tell the difference between 240Hz and 480Hz. If you're not going to use your computer for extensive gaming, the most likely answer is no, and you're better off spending your money on other computer parts you will use more often.

 But if you're a competitive gamer, especially if you play first-person shooters and like to enjoy other content at higher resolutions, too, this might be a worthwhile investment.

 However, you should also look at your available hardware. For example, my computer only has an RTX 3060 video card, so it's struggling to run the 4K 144Hz [Redmagic 4K Gaming Monitor](https://www.makeuseof.com/redmagic-4k-gaming-monitor-review/) .

 If you want to maximize the 4K@240Hz or 1080p@480Hz feature of these dual-mode monitors, you should ensure that you're running the latest, most powerful video cards, like the 7900 XTX or 7900 XT from AMD and RTX 4090 or RTX 4080 from NVIDIA.

 Aside from that, you must consider that your other components, like your CPU or RAM, can support your GPU. Otherwise, you might run into [PC bottlenecking issues](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-bottlenecking-my-pc-how-do-i-fix-it/) and not get the most out of these dual-mode monitors.

 If you have the cash to spend on these new displays and the hardware to match their capabilities, then you should absolutely buy one. They will give you an advantage over your opponents while giving you visual satisfaction when you're not in a competitive match.

 But having the best gear will not automatically mean better skills; you still have to practice and put in the hard work. The dual-mode monitor is just a tool to help you play better.
