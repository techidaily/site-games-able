## Best Overall USB Hub for PS5: Anker Ultra Slim 4-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub

![Anker USB hub with four USB A ports](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/anker-usb-hub.jpg)

 The[Anker Ultra Slim 4-Port USB 3.0 Data Hub](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Extended-MacBook-Surface-Notebook/dp/B07L32B9C2?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2020627&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-usb-hubs-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is arguably the best USB hub for anyone with a PS5\. It connects to one of the USB-A ports on the console and offers four regular USB-A ports that you can use to connect different[PS5 accessories](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-ps5-accessories/) , so you no longer have to constantly switch out devices.

 It supports 5Gbps speeds instead of 10Gbps as with the PS5's USB ports, but it's not a dealbreaker since most PS5 accessories don't require USB 3.2 Gen 2 speeds. Only SSD external drives can take full advantage of 10Gbps, but Sony recommends you connect them directly to the console.

 The build quality is solid, and it comes with a relatively long (2ft) cable, giving you a lot of flexibility on where to place the hub on your desk. While it's not powered, this hub can charge your controllers and headsets as long as the console is on.

Designed specifically for the PS5, the hub fits right onto the console's front USB ports, allowing you to connect up to four USB-A devices and one USB-C device seamlessly and charge a controller or headset.

 The hub supports USB 2.0 speeds but works fine with headsets, keyboards, game controllers, and speakers. Additionally, the fast charging port makes charging your controller a breeze. The only downside is that it doesn't work with the PSVR unit or camera because of the lower bandwidth, but you can plug those into the free ports at the back. The build quality is impressive, especially considering the affordable price tag, and it has a sleek black-and-white design that complements the PS5's aesthetic.
