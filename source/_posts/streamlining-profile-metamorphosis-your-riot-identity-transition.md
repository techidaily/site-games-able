## Streamlining Profile Metamorphosis: Your Riot Identity Transition

 Choosing a gamer tag for yourself can be a hit or miss. You need a name that is catchy, unique, and maybe funny. It might take a couple of tries before you settle down with a gamer tag you really like.

 Most games offer you the choice to modify your username and gamer tag one way or another. By the end, you'll know how to change your in-game name on Riot Games for the better. This would allow you to easily modify your gamer tag on games like Valorant and League of Legends.

## How to Change Your Riot Games ID and Tagline

 Games developed by Riot Games use a single account to fetch the name and tagline of a user. Therefore, if you want to change your gamer tag on any such game, say Valorant, you'll have to edit the username on your Riot Games account.

To do that, follow the steps below:

1. Head over to[account.riotgames.com](https://account.riotgames.com) and enter your account credentials to sign in.
2. On the Riot Account Management page, edit the**RIOT ID** and**TAGLINE** fields to change your display name and ID.
3. Finally, click on**Save Changes** to proceed.

 You can only change your Riot name and tagline once every 30 days. If you've already modified your details for the said period, your account dashboard will display a notification stating the same.
