 So you’ve made the decision to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch to the Nintendo Switch OLED.

## Does the Nintendo Switch OLED Work With the Old Dock?

 The short answer is yes! You can still use your Nintendo Switch OLED with your old Nintendo Switch docking station. It might not have the shiny new white coat of paint or a LAN port, but it will still fulfill its duties of streaming your Nintendo Switch gameplay to your TV.

 If you[compare the Nintendo Switch OLED to the original Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-vs-switch-oled-model/) , the former holds many advantages. In terms of shape and size, however, they are almost identical. At first glance, both systems look the same, but the Nintendo Switch OLED is a fraction of an inch wider than its predecessor.

 But apart from the size and obvious screen upgrade, that's more-or-less where the physical differences between the two systems end. Both Switch models have the same charging port, which is how the Switch connects to the dock. That means that your old dock will still connect to your new OLED Switch without any problems, and vice versa.

 The Nintendo Switch docking station has an open design, so the size difference doesn’t matter either. Your Nintendo Switch OLED will still fit snuggly inside your old dock.

 The Nintendo Switch OLED's upgraded screen makes gameplay look incredible when you're playing handheld. There are, however, a few settings you can change to[improve your Nintendo Switch graphics while docked](https://www.makeuseof.com/improve-nintendo-switch-docked-graphics/) , so your game can look just as good on your TV as it does in your hands.

 All Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons are also compatible with both models, so you might want to refrain from throwing those into the depths of your closet as well. The white Joy-Cons that come with the Nintendo Switch OLED are exactly the same as those of the original Nintendo Switch. This means you can still mix and match your Joy-Cons to switch up your color scheme, or play multiplayer with a friend on a new OLED with your old Joy-Cons.

## Are There Any Old Switch Accessories I Can't Use With the Nintendo Switch OLED?

 While you can still use your old docking station and Joy-Cons, some other accessories might not work with the Nintendo Switch OLED. Aside from being 1cm larger, the buttons along the top of the Switch and game card slot have a slightly different layout.

 This means that hardcover protective cases and grips that are made to fit the original Nintendo Switch will not be compatible with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. There are also some Nintendo LABO kits that won't be able to accommodate the Nintendo OLED’s wider size.

## Keep Hold of Your Original Nintendo Switch Dock

 While the Nintendo Switch OLED docking station might have all the bells and whistles, you can still rely on your original dock to do the job.

 To make the most out of your Nintendo Switch gaming sessions, set your old dock up in another room, so you don’t have to unplug and move it every time you want to game on the big screen.
