[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GUNNAR-Gaming-Computer-Glasses-Blocks/dp/B00JKWVCKG?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013562&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-gaming-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$50 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/GUNNAR-Gaming-Computer-Glasses-Riot-Onyx-Clear-Tint/710478309)

 With an extensive product range already established, GUNNAR is no stranger to the gaming glasses industry. And its GUNNAR Riot glasses are an excellent choice for gamers looking to reduce the effects of harmful blue light, allowing you to keep gaming for longer.

 GUNNAR’s patented lens technology has been employed here with the Riot glasses to provide protection against blue light, dry eyes, and screen glare. Riot’s lenses are housed inside a polycarbonate frame and have a mild yellow tint to them. The intention with this design is to replicate natural light, and thereby minimize the effects of eye strain.

 This tint not only protects the eyes, but also treats them to enhanced contrast and sharpness, too, allowing you to better focus on your gameplay. They can block up to 98 percent of blue light, and their hard lens coating also helps prevent any scratch damage. These stylish frames walk the walk and talk the talk as one of the best mid-range options currently available.

Best Value

##### Setex Blue Light Blocking Glasses

Superior grip for anti-slip gameplay

 Featuring their patented Gecko Grip, the Setex Blue Light Blocking Glasses provide non-slip comfort for hours on end. With just a 40 percent lens tint, you can enjoy longer gaming sessions with minimal color distortion and improved visibility.

**Pros**

* Affordable
* Best gaming grip for noses
* Ultra-lightweight
* Flexible
* Effective UV and blue light protection

**Cons**

* Less effective at reducing glare

[$30 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Setex-Blocking-Glasses-Gaming-Anti-Slip/dp/B0C4BBKN2G?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013562&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-gaming-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate)

 Already well-versed in the gaming peripherals market, Setex has turned its hand to producing its own blue light-blocking glasses. Featuring their own Gecko Grip design with the optional anti-slip nose grips included, they make a fine choice for gamers on a budget.

 Flexible spring hinges add to the overall comfort level here and mean that your head (large or small) is adequately catered for. The ultra-light frame weighs just 22 grams, and the lenses feature a 40 percent yellow tint to provide effective protection against blue light with as little compromise to visual quality as possible.

 The downside (if there is one) is that they are non-polarized. Excellent for blocking blue light and UV light, but less effective at reducing the glare factor. However, with superior comfort and grip (even when faced with the oiliest of noses), and a competitive price point, Setex’s gaming glasses offer premium blue light protection that won’t cost the Earth.

 If you have the money to burn, you might like to cast it into the inferno. We’re talking, of course, about the Gamer Advantage Inferno gaming glasses. With a near-clear lens that does away with the usual sickly yellow hue that adorns many blue light glasses, you can enjoy 100 percent UV protection as well.

 That yellow is still present in Inferno’s resin lenses, as it needs to be to fight the effects of prolonged blue light exposure. But it has been toned down to the lowest level possible, thanks to Gamer Advantage’s Rezme lens technology. The result is glasses that are effective at blocking out 41 percent of the most harmful blue light.

 These frames are effortlessly stylish and have plenty of flex to suit all head shapes and sit well with your gaming headset of choice. They come complete with a polarized sunglasses clip that transforms them into powerful anti-glare sunglasses too. The devil is in the details, and Gamer Advantage has delivered a premium pair of blue light glasses here with the Inferno, and with a price tag to match.

Best Blue Light Blocking

##### Okany Blue Light Blocking Glasses

 Blocks 100 percent of harmful blue light

 Enjoy 100 percent protection against harmful blue light with Okany's Blue Light Blocking Glasses. These super cool gaming glasses feature eight layers of protection, including two layers of blue light protection, making them a great choice for longer sessions.

**Pros**

* 100 percent blue light blocking
* 100 percent UV protection
* Anti-scratch lenses
* Lightweight frames

**Cons**

* Strong yellow tint won't appeal to all gamers

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Technology-Anti-Fatigue-Protection-Eyestrain/dp/B09QYW1CJ8?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013562&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-gaming-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate)

 A straight-up pair of gaming glasses, these Okany Blue Light Blocking Glasses feature a very noticeable yellow tint, and they don’t care hue knows it! Designed specifically for gamers, they are effective at blocking 100 percent of harmful blue light. Plus, the polycarbonate lenses offer anti-scratch and anti-reflection protection.

 The trade-off with glasses such as these is that the greater the blue light protection provided, the more yellow the tint of the lenses. And effective though they are against blue light, you might be put off by something with such a strong yellow tint. This tint will obviously taint the visuals of your gameplay somewhat.

 However, with eight-layer protection embedded into these Okany lenses (including two blue light-blocking layers), you can certainly game safer for longer. The polycarbonate frame is comfortable enough for longer stretches, and it plays nicely with headsets too, which is a bonus. These glasses are excellent for mitigating blue light damage, if you can live with the stronger yellow tinge.

Lightest

##### KLIM Optics Blue Light Blocking Glasses

 Super lightweight protection against 92 percent of blue light

 At just 0.7 ounces, the KLIM Optics Blue Light Blocking Glasses are one of the most lightweight pairs of gaming glasses you can find. Effective at blocking 92 percent of blue light, they also offer plenty of protection against its ill effects.

**Pros**

* Blocks 92% of blue light
* Very lightweight
* Surprisingly durable

**Cons**

* Yellow tint can affect some darker games

[$25 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/KLIM-Optics-Blocking-Protection-Blockers/dp/B072R1HXX6?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013562&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-gaming-glasses%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$31 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/KLIM-Optics-Blue-Light-Blocking-Glasses-Reduce-Eye-Strain-Fatigue-Gaming-PC-Mobile-TV-Blocks-92-Computer-UV-Protection/741260092)

 Also new for 2023, these KLIM Optics Blue Light Blocking Glasses offer 92 percent protection against harmful blue light, reducing fatigue, dry eyes, and associated headaches. Weighing in at a paltry 0.7 ounces, you’ll barely feel them sat on your nose. The frame is made from TR90, a flexible thermoplastic material, which gives them a super lightweight feel.

 As you might expect, the level of blue light protection here comes at a price. Not in monetary terms (the price point is actually very reasonable), but in terms of the yellow tint on the lenses. So, if you’re partial to survival horror titles, for instance, you may find that the yellow tint doesn’t play too well with the darker color palette on-screen.

 Nevertheless, for advanced blue light filtering, these gaming glasses take some beating. Their reinforced frame is surprisingly durable, given its weight, and the lenses offer a decent level of protection against scratch damage too.

## Finding the Right Blue Light Glasses for You

 When searching for the ideal pair of blue light-blocking gaming glasses there are a couple of things to consider, besides your budget.

 Naturally, you'll want something that will be comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, so you'll need some frames with a bit of flexibility. Obviously, you'll want something that provides effective protection against blue light damage, too. But there's often a trade-off between blue light blocking and color distortion. Yellow-tinted lenses are great for blocking out blue light, but not so great at minimizing color distortion while you play. Striking the right balance between these two factors is key.

 The GUNNAR Riot glasses tick a lot of the right boxes. In the mid-range in terms of price point, they offer decent protection against blue light, with a relatively minor trade-off in terms of color distortion. Their yellow tint is as slight as it can be, without it affecting the color palette of your games. Plus, they also protect against screen glare, which is a bonus.

 For budget buyers, the Setex Blue Light Blocking Glasses are well worth considering. With Gecko Grip nose pads they provide ultimate comfort, and won't slip from your nose. They offer reasonable blue light-blocking capabilities and are also great for protecting against UV light as well. Less effective against glare, they are still one of the very best options available for the price.

 But for the asking price, the HyperX Spectre Stealth hit that sweet spot between form and function. For stylish cool looks, they're unbeatable. Plus, they provide good all-around protection against blue light and UV light damage. They're lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and flexible enough to fit most shapes and sizes of heads and noses. Plus, they can sit comfortably alongside your favorite gaming headset without causing an obstruction. Spectre-tacular.
