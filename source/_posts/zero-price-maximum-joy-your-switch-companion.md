## Zero Price, Maximum Joy - Your Switch Companion

 After spending so much money buying a Nintendo Switch, you probably don’t have enough funds to buy all the games you want.

 Fortunately, the Nintendo eShop has a solution: free-to-play games. There are many great games you can download and start playing without spending a single dime.

 Here are some of the best free-to-play games you can get on your Nintendo Switch.

## 1. Fall Guys

 It had been a long time coming, but in 2022, we finally saw Fall Guys for the first time on the Nintendo Switch. The good news is that Fall Guys came out as a free-to-play game. Was the wait worth it? That is probably up to you to decide.

 What is true is that this game is still silly, charming, and fun to play. You’ll control your very own Fall Guy, which you can customize with different skins, accessories, and emotes.

 There are also many different games you can play by yourself, with random players, or with friends and family. The main goal is to beat as many mini-games as possible and earn experience, Kudos (this game's in-game currency), or Crowns.

 While Fall Guys might feel repetitive if you play it for too long, it’s still a nice game to play on your off time or when you want to play something that doesn’t require much skill.

## 2. Pokémon Café ReMix

 If you love Pokémon, puzzles, and free games, you’ll surely love Pokémon Café ReMix. Previously known as Pokémon Café Mix, this game lets you manage your very own café and serve food and drinks to the Pokémon that visit you.

 The gameplay is pretty simple: You’ll mostly need to cater to your customers and bring them the dishes they want. You create these dishes by solving puzzles and using the right ingredients. If a Pokémon likes your services and your café, they might even start working for you.

 Granted, this game might not be for you if you’re more of a competitive player. But if you want a different Pokémon experience and want a nice relaxing time, you should try it. After all, the game is free to download on your Nintendo Switch, and you can play on your smartphone, too.

## 3. Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel

 You’ve probably heard of Yu-Gi-Oh! before, but did you know there’s a game you can play for free on your console? Master Duel brings everything that makes Yu-Gi-Oh! fun and competitive to the Nintendo Switch.

 Just like regular Yu-Gi-Oh!, Master Duel lets you create your own deck with many cards from the trading card game. You can then use your deck against players worldwide to reach different ranks. Or you can take your deck to the Solo mode, where you'll play against the computer and earn many rewards.

 While the game is really fun, it’s worth mentioning that you won’t have access to all these cards from the get-go. Like many other trading card games, you will have to pay for the chance to unlock several cards. What’s more, some of the most competitive decks will require two or even three copies of the same card, which might be a bit hard—and expensive—for most of us.

 So, while the game is free, microtransactions might ruin your experience. The good news is that when you’re starting, the game will give you a good amount of gems, so you should be able to build a very good deck without spending a dime.

## 4. Tetris 99

 Whoever said that Tetris and[Battle Royale games](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-battle-royale-games/) don’t mix well together? Tetris 99 is an online version of the classic game Tetris. In it, you’ll compete against up to 98 other players.

 The gameplay is the same as regular Tetris, so your goal is to keep your board clear as much as possible by aligning your bricks into rows to make them disappear. One of the key differences is that you can send “garbage” to other players to eliminate them. Of course, that’s easier said than done.

 Surprisingly, the competitive aspect of Tetris 99 makes the game a really fun experience. Plus, winning a game feels way more satisfying.

 It’s worth noting that while Tetris 99 is technically free, you will need a[Nintendo Switch Online subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online-everything-need-know/) to play it. If you’re already subscribed, then this game is worth checking out.

## 5. Fortnite

 Fortnite is a game that needs no introduction. This game has become so popular that it’s partnered with other popular names in the entertainment industry, like Ariana Grande, Marvel, and Dragon Ball.

 Fortnite is one of the biggest online multiplayer and Battle Royale games available and one of the reasons is that the game is completely free to play.

 You can buy anything from skins to emotes and battle passes using its in-game currency, V-Bucks—which you can get by playing or with real-life money—but you don’t need any of that to play the game and have some fun.

## 6. Fallout Shelter

 Fallout Shelter is a Fallout game like you’ve never seen before. Instead of exploring the wasteland with nothing but your skills and weapons, you manage a vault and keep the people inside happy (and alive).

 Each person, or dweller, will have different stats to help you keep your vault running properly. Depending on their SPECIAL stats, the dwellers can help you produce water, energy, or entertainment.

 And, of course, since you’re still living in a post-apocalyptic world, some dwellers are good at fighting, which is great when you have to deal with the occasional infestations.

 Fallout Shelter isn’t an action-packed game, but if you’re into management simulators and want to explore the wasteland, keep dwellers alive, and expand your vault into a fully-operational facility, this game is fun and will keep you playing on your Nintendo Switch or smartphone.

## 7. Pokémon Unite

 If you don’t want to run a café for Pokémon, you can always try to make them fight in an arena. Pokémon Unite is an interesting multiplayer game in which you control a Pokémon and battle against other players online.

 The game mechanics are pretty similar to games like League of Legends, so you’ll probably already know if this game is for you or not. You’ll enter an arena with four other players and start battling a different team.

 The battle system is completely different from the main Pokémon games, so don’t expect your fire-type Pokémon to be super effective against your opponent’s water-type Pokémon. Instead, you’ll have to rely on your skills and special moves to defeat the opponent.

 Pokémon Unite is one of the[best MOBA games you can play today](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-moba-games-to-play/) . You'll have a great time if you’re a fan of the Pokémon franchise.

## 8. Super Kirby Clash

 Whether you love Kirby or want something to play with your friends, Super Kirby Clash is a perfect game for your Nintendo Switch.

 This free-to-play game is the spiritual successor of a 3DS game called Kirby Clash Deluxe. You'll have to team up with three other players to go on a quest to defeat evil bosses.

 You and your teams can choose a Kirby variant with a different ability. For instance, you can stop time, heal your teammates, or cause a lot of damage to the bosses.

 During your quests, you can earn different rewards to improve your weapons or unlock more quests. Overall, Super Kirby Clash is a cute game that will give you countless hours of fun with your friends and family.

## 9. Rocket League

 Do you love soccer and fast cars? Why not put them together and play some Rocket League? This free-to-play game has been one of the[most popular multiplayer titles](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-awesome-cross-platform-mobile-multiplayer-games/) since 2020 and for a good reason.

 The rules are simple. You enter a soccer field with your favorite car, and your job is to score as many goals as you can. Playing soccer with a car makes the game both fun and difficult, but it is much more rewarding when you score.
