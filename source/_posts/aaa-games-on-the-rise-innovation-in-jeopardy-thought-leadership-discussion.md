## AAA Games on the Rise: Innovation in Jeopardy? [Thought Leadership Discussion]

 This week's podcast is a discussion around the recent comments from Ubisoft executive Philippe Tremblay concerning the [future of game subscriptions](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-exec-says-gamers-need-to-get-comfortable-not-owning-their-games-for-subscriptions-to-take-off) . Specifically:

> "One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. (...) So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game."
