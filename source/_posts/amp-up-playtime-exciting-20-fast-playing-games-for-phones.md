## 1 iSlash Heroes

Close

 Sharpen your blade and prepare for iSlash Heroes. Your goal is to slash pieces of the board away until the meter reaches the red ribbon. The trick is to watch out for the bouncing ninja stars because if you hit one, you lose a life.

## 2 Fishing Break

Close

 Fishing Break is a casual and colorful challenge. You hop into your boat and travel to different watery worlds, catching fish and creating a collection. Swipe to cast, then tap and hold to reel in your catch. Just be careful not to pull them in too quickly, or they may break the line.
