 Marvel Snap launched in 2023 and became an instant hit. Later updates also introduced the ability for players to invite their friends to games.

 This two-player card game can be played on mobile as well as Steam. While the main mode is a two-player ranked mode, you also get the unranked Conquest mode and the Friendly mode (which lets you invite specific friends).

 The short matches are a great way to kill some time and the large variety of cards can appeal to different play styles.

![rocket league sideswipe 2v2 match](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rocket-league-sideswipe-2v2-match.jpg)

 Rocket League Sideswipe is a mobile take on the popular Rocket League game. In the mobile title, you can play with friends or strangers online.

 If you want to play with friends, you will have to invite them to a party using the in-app Epic Games integration. This will allow you to play in 2v2 matches with others online.

 If you want to play the 1v1 mode, the game will match you with another player online.

 While the controls and perspective are different, Rocket League Sideswipe captures the fun and chaos of the original PC title.

 If you're looking for something a little different, Badland is a unique title with a great art style that the critics have praised. The aim of the game is to guide your blob through obstacles until you reach the end of the stage.

 The game has both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. You play on the same device, which is the best way to coordinate your characters in real-time.

![shark character in ultimate bowmasters](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shark-character-in-ultimate-bowmasters.jpg)

 Ultimate Bowmasters combines ragdoll physics, a charming art style, and cartoon violence to create a game that is fiendishly fun. The aim is to eliminate your opponent by lobbing a weapon towards them.

 Calculating the trajectory of your weapon is half the fun. Meanwhile, the other half is landing the target and watching your friend's dismay.

 Before you can unlock the game's PvP modes, you will need to complete the tutorial. After that, two players can compete on the same device.

 While the game is fun and simple, its ads can be intrusive. If you find yourself really enjoying the game, you might want to opt for the in-app purchase to remove them.

Close

 After the success that was the Scrabble-inspired game Words With Friends, Zynga launched Words With Friends 2—an updated version. Two-player Android games that emulate classic board games are notoriously popular and this one is no different.

 You can play online either with random opponents or add friends that you invite to play. Another benefit of the game is that if you're interrupted, you can continue your turn later.

 However, you are required to sign in to the game with either Facebook or your email address.

 Clash Royale comes from the developers of Clash of Clans and is a mixture of a battle card and tower defense game. Opponents draw attackers and defenders from their deck of cards, with the aim of destroying the competitor's towers before your own are destroyed.

 You'll need to finish the tutorial before you can play against a friend. Once you unlock this mode, you simply need to add your friend and start a friendly match. You can also play with users from around the world using the game's standard battle mode.

 Golf Battle lets you play 1v1 matches online with your friends on your smartphone, but you can hold matches with up to six people. The catch is that you need to connect via Facebook.

 However, the game has a lot going for it—providing plenty of casual fun with short challenges and matches. It also doesn't require too much concentration and doesn't have a steep learning curve, making it easy to hop in and enjoy.

 If your friends aren't available, you can also join public matches—the default multiplayer mode of the game.

 You will need to sign up for or log into your Hoyoverse account to get started. Even after downloading the app, there is more data you will need to load before getting into the game. We recommend that you do this over Wi-Fi.

 Once in the game, you can invite people on your friends list to join you for a co-op session. If you want to add new friends, you can do so using their user ID.

 Dots and Boxes turns a traditional childhood pen-and-paper game into a convenient way to kill time with your phone. With local multiplayer, two people can play the game using the same phone.

 This offline functionality makes it useful when you don't have access to Wi-Fi. It's a simple, yet competitive and addictive game.

## 10\. Tank Stars

![tank stars two player mobile game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tank-stars-two-player-game.jpg)

 Tank Stars is a Worms-inspired tactical game that has a very similar graphical style to Ultimate Bowmasters. The variety of tanks and weapons, combined with the precision element of aiming, makes the game a fulfilling way to challenge your friends.

 You can play on the same device or by connecting over the same Wi-Fi network. However, both modes need to be unlocked by completing a few practice AI matches.

 The downside to the game is the in-game ads, which appear even if you have a[Google Play Pass subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-play-pass-apps-games/) .

Close

 Crossy Road takes inspiration from the classic retro game Frogger, delivering the same frustrating and addictive gameplay with a fun block aesthetic.

 The two-player mode allows you to play on the same device using a split-screen format for input. While the game opens in the standard mode, you can switch to the competitive mode by clicking the icon with a duck and a chicken.

You can simultaneously compete with and sabotage your opponent.

![terraria mobile tutorial](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/terraria-mobile-tutorial.jpg)

 While most of these games are designed for short bouts of gameplay, Terraria is a multiplayer mobile game that you can spend hours playing. It is a mobile port of the popular PC game and allows you to play with friends using local Wi-Fi or by connecting to a dedicated server.

 It's an inexpensive way for two players to enjoy a mobile game together. However, using the mobile version of the game can be difficult for those used to the simpler controls of a PC or console. We would definitely recommend[connecting a controller to your Android phone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-a-game-controller-to-android-for-console-like-gameplay-si/) or iPhone.

## 13\. Warcraft Rumble

![warcraft rumble two player pvp](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/warcraft-rumble-two-player-pvp.jpg)

Close

 Warcraft Rumble is similar to Clash Royale, but is themed around the characters and figures in Azeroth—the setting for the Warcraft games.

 Instead of collecting cards, you collect mini-figures. You then place these mini-figures on a map and try to destroy your opponent's base.

 The game has PvP and PvE modes. As of February 2024, the two-player game only allows you to match with strangers online. However, the ability to match with friends will likely be introduced in future.

Close

 Archery Battle is a sports game that pits you against another opponent as you each try to prove your archery skills. The aim is simple: try to get as close as possible to the center of the archery target.

 You can play against strangers online or link your Facebook account to play with friends.

![a 1v1 match in 8 ball pool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/a-1v1-match-in-8-ball-pool.jpg)

 8 Ball Pool is another free mobile game for two players that lets you play against friends or strangers. You can invite friends to play via Facebook, adding them with a unique ID, or sending them a friend request link. Otherwise, you can add friends from the strangers you play online.

 The 1v1 matches follow the same format as the game's real-life counterpart. Sink your balls and finally the black ball before the other player.

 Matches are relatively quick and the aim mechanic is surprisingly intuitive, giving you a sense of satisfaction when you sink a tricky shot.

 Hopefully one of these games has piqued your interest. Each of them allows you to play two-player games on a smartphone, either through online connectivity or by using co-op modes on the same device.
