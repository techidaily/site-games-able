## Eradicate Epic Game Crashes on Windows Systems

 The Epic Games Launcher serves as the central hub for launching and managing all your games bought or downloaded from the Epic Store. However, you can’t do any of that if the Epic Games Launcher keeps freezing or crashing on your Windows computer.

 If you are facing a similar issue, this guide contains some troubleshooting tips that will help.

## 1\. Close the Epic Games Launcher Completely and Reopen It

 The Epic Games Launcher may freeze on your Windows PC due to malfunctioning or unresponsive app processes. In most cases, you can resolve the issue by closing the Epic Games Launcher completely and then reopening it. Hence, it's the first thing you should try.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to[open the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) .
2. Locate and select**EpicGamesLauncher** on the list.
3. Click the**End task** option at the top.  
![Close Epic Games Launcher](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/close-epic-games-launcher.jpg)

Reopen the Epic Games Launcher and try using it.

## 2\. Run Epic Games Launcher as an Administrator

 Running the Epic Games Launcher with admin rights can help you avoid any issues caused by a lack of relevant permissions to access system files and settings. Right-click on the**Epic Games Launcher** shortcut and select**Run as administrator** . Select**Yes** when the UAC (User Account Control) prompt appears.

![Run Epic Games Launcher as Admin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/run-epic-games-launcher-as-admin.jpg)

 If this method gets Epic Games Launcher to operate smoothly, you can configure it to[always run as an administrator on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ways-to-run-a-program-as-administrator-in-windows/) .

## 3\. Check the Epic Games Server Status

 Issues with Epic Games servers can also cause its launcher to misbehave on your Windows PC. You should[check Epic Games server status](https://status.epicgames.com/) to ensure they are operating smoothly.
