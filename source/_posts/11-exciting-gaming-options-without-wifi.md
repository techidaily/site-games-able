## 11 Exciting Gaming Options Without WiFi

 Mobile data plans are a dime a dozen these days. Still, even so-called unlimited data plans often have hidden caps, restrictions, and speed throttling. This huge inconvenience is why it's important to install some fun mobile games that don't require a strong internet connection or use data.

 Unfortunately, the most popular mobile games often require an internet connection just to open them. And if you want to play them, you'll need to spend even more data. So here are the best mobile games that don't use data and don't need an internet connection to play.

## 1\. Alto's Odyssey

 There's no doubt that Alto's Odyssey is one of [the most beautiful games you can play on your smartphone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-games-pretty-youll-forget-theyre-played-smartphone/) . But that's not all; it's also incredibly fun to play.

 Alto's Odyssey has everything that made its predecessor, Alto's Adventure, great. That means intuitive and easy-to-learn controls, a beautiful atmosphere, and many places to explore. Your goal is to go as far as you can, exploring different places and learning their secrets.

 Along the way, you'll also unlock other characters you can use on your adventure. Overall, this game is extremely fun, and you'll love experiencing a new world with beautiful places. And if you think [Apple Arcade is worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-apple-arcade-worth-it-in-2021/) , then you'll love playing Alto's Odyssey — Remastered, which looks even better than the original.

**Download:** Alto's Odyssey for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosodyssey&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) (free, in-app purchases available) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409) ($0.99)

## 2\. Plague Inc

 If you've ever played the Pandemic flash game, you'll love Plague Inc. The concept is the same: your goal is to spread the plague, infect the world, and bring humanity to an end.

 It sounds like it would be easy, but this is a strategy game at its core—not so difficult that you'll want to give up, but it offers enough of a challenge to keep you playing. Every country will try its best to stop the plague, so you'll need to be quick and smart to stop them.

**Download:** Plague Inc. for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.plagueinc) (free, in-app purchases available) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/plague-inc/id525818839) ($0.99)

## 3\. Shattered Pixel Dungeon

 If you've never played Shattered Pixel Dungeon (or the original Pixel Dungeon), you've been missing out. It's probably the best introduction to the roguelikes on Android genre. In short, it's a lightweight RPG with randomly generated levels, items, and monsters.

 This means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. It's unique every time, so it'll be a long time before you get bored of playing this one.

**Download:** Shattered Pixel Dungeon for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon) (free, in-app purchases available) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109) ($4.99)

## 4\. Unblock Me

 You may know Unblock Me by its real-life counterpart, Rush Hour. The setup is simple: you have a 6x6 grid of blocks that can only move in the direction of their length, and your goal is to get the red block out of the grid.

 It's a puzzle game, obviously, harder than you might expect—but in a fun, addictive way. At first, you won't have a problem with any level, but as you go forward, you'll have to stop and think about your next move. It pushes you to think outside the box, and each victory is quite satisfying.

**Download:** Unblock Me for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiragames.unblockmefree) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/unblock-me-free/id315019111) (free, in-app purchases available)

## 5\. Doodle Jump

 Doodle Jump is a never-ending vertical jumper. In contrast to a lot of popular endless runner games, Doodle Jump feels less frantic and chaotic. Instead, it's addictive and one of [the best mobile games to kill time](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fast-fun-free-mobile-games/) .

 Your goal is to climb each level as high as you can go. Just make sure you don't fall or collide with any enemies. There are lots of unique obstacles that pose a challenge, but there are also many power-ups to help you out. Of course, if you want something more modern, you can also try Doodle Jump 2, but you really can't beat the classics.

**Download:** Doodle Jump for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lima.doodlejump) (free, in-app purchases available) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/doodle-jump/id307727765) ($0.99)

## 6\. Mini Metro

 Mini Metro must be one of the [most relaxing strategy games](https://www.makeuseof.com/relaxing-mobile-games/) ever made. Ever wanted to be a subway network planner, trying to maximize passenger pickup/dropoff efficiency while chilling to the calm, rhythmic bopping of ambient sounds? Then this is the game for you, and we believe everyone should try it at least once.

**Download:** Mini Metro for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.codepoint.minimetro) ($1.06) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/mini-metro/id837860959) ($3.99)

## 7\. Cut the Rope

 When it comes to classic mobile games on the App Store and Google Play Store, Cut the Rope is one of the best. This game uses physics in such a clever and easy-to-understand way that you'll become addicted to this game in no time.

## 8\. Super Hexagon

 Looking for a tough game that doesn't treat you like a child? Super Hexagon is that game. It's really simple but really hard—in fact, it's one of [the hardest games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-hardest-games-in-the-whole-wide-world/) available. The average player loses their first game in three seconds.

 What's great about Super Hexagon is that it's hard but fair. Every loss is your fault, making you want to try again. With enough practice, everyone can eventually beat this game (assuming they don't give up first).

**Download:** Super Hexagon for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36652/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distractionware.superhexagon) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-hexagon/id549027629) ($2.99)

## 9\. Papers, Please

 Papers, Please is one of the [best console games you can play on your smartphone](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/console-games-android-iphone/) .

This game will give you nine different letters, and your job is to find as many words as possible. Don't worry; the game will give you as many hints as you need if you get stuck.

## 11\. Journey

 Journey is one of the best, most relaxing indie games you can find on any console or smartphone. This game won't tell you anything about itself. When you start, you don't know what you're doing or where you're going; all you know is that you must continue to figure it out.
