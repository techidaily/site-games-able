## Block Party Plan: Engaging Friends in Innovative Minecraft Gameplay

 Playing Minecraft by yourself is a blast... but playing Minecraft with friends is an entirely new world of fun. If you're not sure how to play Minecraft with friends yet, don't worry; we'll make it quick and easy for you in this article.

 You have more than a few options for Minecraft Multiplayer; some of which require an internet connection, while you can play other methods offline and from the same room.

 Regardless of how you want to craft, we'll look at how to play Minecraft with friends.

 We've included instructions for both Minecraft Java Edition (JE) and Minecraft Bedrock Edition (BE).

## 1\. Join Minecraft Public Servers

 Both Bedrock and Java Edition have public servers available for anyone to join. You can find servers on Bedrock easily on any platform whether you're on console, PC, or mobile, but there are limitations. Java has fewer limitations, but you'll need to do some digging to find good servers, and you might need to deal with more technical issues.

 While Java Edition is only on PC, you can[play Minecraft on Steam Link](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-game-pass-on-steam-link-with-glossi/) and play it on your TV, phone, or tablet and get close to a cross-platform experience.

### Minecraft Java Edition

![Minecraft multiplayer server list](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mc-server-list-multiplayer.png)

 Public servers are what most Java players use to link up with others. Servers are free to join and you can find them by using any of the many server-listing sites such as[minecraftservers.org](https://minecraftservers.org) (just search "Minecraft Servers" in your web browser to find more listing sites).

 We've covered an in-depth guide on[how to join a Minecraft server](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-minecraft-server/) already, but here's a quick rundown:

1. Copy the IP Address of the server you want to join. This will look something like "makeuseof.example.com"
2. Navigate to the**Multiplayer** screen in your Minecraft client. Click on**Add Server** or**Direct Connection** .
3. Paste the IP address into the box labeled**Server Address** .
4. If you chose**Add Server** on step two, give the server a name and click**Done** , then double-click on the server from your list or select it and choose**Join Server** . If you chose**Direct Connection** , click**Join Server** .

 Joining servers in Bedrock Edition is a lot easier, here's how to do it:

### Minecraft Bedrock Edition

![Minecraft Bedrock Edition Servers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minecraft-bedrock-edition-servers.jpg)

 While your range is narrower than Java Edition players', there are definitely public servers you can join to play Minecraft with your friends in Bedrock Edition.

1. Start Minecraft BE. Click**Play** and navigate to the**Servers** tab.
2. You can choose from the list of**Featured Servers** which have a high player count and feature game modes like Skywars, Build Battle, and more.
3. You can also add another server by clicking**Add Server** .
4. Enter the server's name, IP address, and port. Click**Save** to keep this server bookmarked.

 If you don't want to pay to host a server, there are third-party services you can try like the ones we'll show you below.

## 2\. Minecraft Server Hosting Services

 Hosting your own private Minecraft server is great if you just want to experience it with your friends. However, you either have to pay for Minecraft Realms or get a powerful PC that you'll have to keep on if you want your friends to keep playing on the server while you're away.

 Thankfully, there's an alternative method. You can set up a Minecraft server for free with services like Minehut or Aternos. These services have their own computers that host the servers for you so you don't have to keep your computer on all the time. Here's how to set up a server on Aternos:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Aternos Create a Server button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/aternos-create-a-server-button.jpg)

 In Aternos, log in and click on**Create a Server** .

![Aternos MUO test server IP address](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/aternos-muo-test-server-ip-address.jpg)

 In the next page, you can customize the IP address your friends will use to connect and choose whether you want Bedrock or Java Edition. After that, click**Create** .

![MUO Aternos server start button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-aternos-server-start-button.jpg)

 Finally, you'll need to click on the large green**Start** button. Once it's on, you can copy the IP address and paste it into Minecraft as you would a public server. This server is all yours and you can even[install CurseForge to add Minecraft mods](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-curseforge-to-install-minecraft-mod-packs/) and upload copies of existing worlds if you wanted.

## 3\. Minecraft Realms

 Minecraft Realms is available for both Java and Bedrock, but they are separate subscriptions. Realms are officially hosted servers that you have to pay for, but it has the benefit of being more convenient, streamlined, and reliable than third-party hosting services.

### How to Create a Minecraft Realm

![Minecraft Realms start new realm](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minecraft-realms-start-new-realm-1.jpg)

**Java Edition** : First, you'll need to purchase a subscription for a Realm (you can check the pricing plans on[Minecraft's website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms-for-java/plans/) ). You can activate a 30-day free trial to test the waters and cancel anytime.

 Once you have a subscription plan, open Minecraft and click**Minecraft Realms** . If this is your first time creating a Realm, click on**click to start your new Realm** . Here you can name your Realm and enter a brief description before choosing your world type.

 Choose between generating a**new world** , uploading a previous world save, or exploring Realms'**World templates** ,**Adventures** , and**Experiences** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Minecraft Java Edition configure Realm](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mc-configure-realm.png)

 Now that you've created your Realm, choose**Configure Realm** (the wrench icon) and click on**Players** . Now all you have to do to whitelist a friend on your server is click**Invite player** and type in their username before clicking**Invite player** again. Your friend will receive an invitation to join your Realm.

**Bedrock Edition** : Minecraft BE is slightly different.

![Minecraft Bedrock Edition Realm edit button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minecraft-bedrock-edition-realm-edit-button.jpg)

1. Start Minecraft BE and click**Play** . Head to**Worlds** and choose**Create New** .
2. Choose**Create New World** again.
3. Select**Create on Realms** from the left pane. Choose a two or 10 player Realm capacity.
4. For a**Two-Player Realm** : Name your Realm, read and agree to the terms and conditions, and select**Create Realm** .
5. For a**10-Player Realm** : Select**Buy Now** from the navigation list. Name your Realm, read and agree to the terms and conditions, and select**Start Free Trial** .

 Now that you know how to create a Realm, you probably want to check out your friends' Realms too. Here's how to join a Realm:

### How to Join a Minecraft Realm

![Minecraft Realms invite envelope](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minecraft-realms-invite-envelope.jpg)

**Java Edition** : If you've received an invitation to join your friend's Realm, open Minecraft and navigate to**Minecraft Realms** .

 At the top of the screen, to the right of where it says**Minecraft Realms** , is a small**envelope** icon. This**envelope** contains any pending invites you've received; click it to join your friend's Realm.

**Bedrock Edition** : Ask for the invite code from the creator of the Realm—we only need the characters after "realms.gg/".

 Launch Minecraft, then click**Play** . Head to**Friends** and click on**Join Realm** . Enter the invite code you received from the Realm owner and click**Join** .

## 4\. Play Minecraft LAN

 While servers are the best way to play Minecraft with friends who are far away, a LAN (Local Access Network) connection is an easy way to craft with friends who are nearby.

### Minecraft Java Edition

<a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Minecraft Java edition scanning for LAN games](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mc-scanning-for-lan-games.png)

 If you're under the same local IP address as the player you want to join, you can do this pretty easily. Launch Minecraft and click on**Multiplayer** . Minecraft will automatically scan for games on your local network.

 If another player has a LAN world available to join, it'll show up in your list of servers. You can either double-tap the server or highlight it and click**Join Server** .

### Minecraft Bedrock Edition

 LAN play is on by default in Bedrock Edition. Just navigate to the**Worlds** tab, and if there are any available games on your network, they'll appear here for you to join.

![Split Screen Minecraft on Switch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/img_3176.jpeg)

 Just like old-school console games, you can play split-screen on Minecraft Bedrock edition with up to four players. This is only available on consoles, but you can get on your couch, and[play split-screen Minecraft on your Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-two-player-minecraft-on-nintendo-switch/) .
