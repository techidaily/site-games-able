## Create a Vibrant Gaming Community on Discord Through Xbox Streams

 Unifying your social media presence with your gaming console of choice can help streamline multiple aspects of your gaming platform. And, with Xbox Series X|S and Discord, not only can you link servers and channels, but you can even stream games directly to Discord.

 As long as you have your Xbox and Discord accounts connected, you are always only a few minutes away from streaming games. But how do you stream your Xbox games directly to Discord, and what do you need to do to ensure the process works? Let's take a look.

## What You Need to Know About Discord on Xbox

 Before we jump into streaming gameplay from your Xbox Series X|S to Discord, there are a few things about how the streaming feature works on Xbox, and Discord functionality, that you may need to be aware of. To be specific, the key aspects of how streaming to Discord on Xbox Series X|S works can be defined by the following:

* The ability to stream games to Discord from Xbox is only available for Xbox Insiders that are opted into the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha rings of the Preview program. Luckily, you can [become an Xbox Insider](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-xbox-insider/) relatively easily.
* Because the feature is only available to Xbox Insiders, you may experience bugs or unintended interruptions when streaming games from your Xbox to Discord.
* As well as being an Xbox Insider, you will need to have linked your Discord and Xbox accounts so you can access Discord from your Xbox Series X|S.

 If you already [use Discord voice chat on your Xbox console](https://www.makeuseof.com/use-discord-voice-chat-xbox-console/) , your accounts should be linked and ready to go. However, if you're new to using Discord on Xbox, the process to link your accounts is simple as long as you have a pre-existing Discord account.

## How to Set Up Discord on Your Xbox

 If you're new to using Discord on Xbox, you'll need to ensure your Xbox and Discord accounts are linked before you try to stream gameplay. And while you can [link social media sites like Twitter and Twitch to your Xbox](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-link-social-accounts/) , to link and set up Discord on your Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight**Profile & system** , and select**Settings** .
* Under**Account** , choose**Linked social accounts** .

![A screenshot of the Account settings available on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/linked-social-accounts.jpg)

* From here, find the**Discord** tab and select**Link** .

* Select**Continue on console** to be taken to the Microsoft Edge application.
* When prompted, sign into your Discord account and select**Authorize** .

 With permission given for your Discord and Xbox accounts to share information, you can access all the supported Discord features available on Xbox Series X|S.

 However, while the features for Discord on Xbox are plentiful, it's best to support your experience of Discord on Xbox with the official Discord app. If you want to [find and join some of the best Discord Servers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-find-best-discord-servers/) or even manage your servers and accounts, you're best doing so on the Discord app: it is not supported on Xbox.

## How to Stream Games Using Discord on Xbox

 Now that your Discord account is linked to your Xbox, and as long as you are an applicable Xbox Insider, you're ready to start streaming games from Xbox to Discord.

 Much like other Discord features, the ability to stream can be accessed via the**Parties & chats** section of the Xbox Guide menu. So to start streaming your Xbox Series X|S gameplay to Discord, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the options for**Parties & chats** , and select**Discord** .

![A screenshot of the Parties and Chats menu on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/parties-and-chats.jpg)

* Choose the**Server** you want to stream from, followed by the specific**Voice channel** .

![A screenshot of the available Discord Voice Channels for an Xbox account on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/discord-voice-channels.jpg)

* From here, select**Stream your game** .

![A screenshot of the Guide menu options for a Discord Voice Channel on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/start-streaming-initial.jpg)

* Choose your streaming preferences by altering**Stream settings** .
* Finally, select**Start streaming** .

![A screenshot of the Stream Settings for Discord on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stream-settings.jpg)

 And with**Start streaming** selected, Discord will stream any game you play directly to the Discord Voice Channel of your choice. You can even alter your**Stream settings** throughout the stream by re-entering the**Discord** menu on the**Parties & chats** screen.

 However, some aspects of your**Stream settings** are locked behind Discord's Nitro paid service, so if you want to stream in a higher resolution than 720p, you'll have to pay for the privilege. But even with this hindrance, streaming to Discord from your Xbox takes mere minutes and feels completely intuitive.

## Make Streaming Gameplay Easy With Discord and Xbox

 While Discord Nitro may cause some unnecessary restrictions, being able to stream your Xbox games directly to a Discord Channel of your choice in a matter of moments makes streaming accessible and easy.

 And with Discord offering numerous ways to enhance gaming communities, sharing gameplay with friends using your Discord account and Xbox console only furthers a gamer-friendly service, enhancing both platforms.
