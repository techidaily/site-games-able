## Top Gaming Screens at the Peak of Performance

 If you want to ascend into ultrawide immersion, there are plenty of gaming monitors available, ranging from affordable 60Hz screens to high-end 240Hz behemoths. While most of these options will provide excellent immersion and the ability to see more of your game at once, we think 144Hz is that sweet spot where ultrawide monitors offer the best balance of performance and affordability.

 Whether it's your first time going ultrawide or you're a veteran looking to upgrade, 144Hz ultrawide monitors hit the sweet spot for most gamers. They tend to cost less and still deliver the speed and responsiveness needed to get the perfect headshot in competitive shooters or give you an advantage in fast-paced games.

 Here are the best 144Hz ultrawide monitors for gaming available right now.

 The AOC U34G3X is a flat-screen 34-inch ultrawide monitor with a 3440x1440 resolution and IPS display, an excellent combination that ensures sharp images and rich, accurate colors. It has better viewing angles than the similar mid-range ultrawide monitors with VA panels, making it great for playing local multiplayer games with friends. In addition, the flat panel comes in handy if you're a creative professional who wants to get every line and angle perfect.

 Designed for gaming first, the U34G3X supports FreeSync Premium VRR and has a rapid 1ms response time in addition to the 144Hz refresh rate. It's excellent for playing competitive multiplayer games, and unlike VA monitors, it handles motion better with little to no ghosting or smearing in fast-moving objects. Overall, this is an excellent alternative to curved ultrawide monitors. It checks all the boxes for gaming, and the sharp display means you can also use it as a primary productivity monitor.

## Choosing the Best 144Hz Ultrawide Gaming Monitor

 While there's no shortage of 144Hz ultrawide gaming monitors, finding one that fits your needs can be an uphill task. If you don't want to go through all the options, the LG UltraGear 34GP83A-B is an excellent pick for most people. It strikes the sweet spot for both gamers and professionals, and you can even overclock it to 160Hz for increased speed and responsiveness.

 If you have more to spend, you can't go wrong with Dell's Alienware AW3821DW. It has better color accuracy, brilliant HDR picture quality, solid cross-platform VRR support, and offers more screen real estate. For gamers on a tight budget, the GIGABYTE G34WQCA provides the perfect compromise between gaming performance, picture quality, and price.

 Ultimately, the best 144Hz ultrawide monitor will depend on your budget and the types of games you plan to play. For competitive shooters and racing titles, combining the 144Hz refresh with quick response time performance and low input lag will give you the best performance. On the other hand, if you play more open-world exploration games, color accuracy, HDR, and higher contrasts should be at the top of your priority list.
