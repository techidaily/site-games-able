### 1\. Restart Google Chrome

 If Chrome fails to load Facebook games, your first step should be to restart Chrome and then try to play the games again. This can be helpful if the problem is caused by a temporary bug or glitch in Chrome.

 So, restart Google Chrome and then check whether Facebook games are loading.

### 2\. Enable JavaScript in Chrome

 JavaScript is a[programming language](https://www.makeuseof.com/programming-language-different-types/) that helps browsers like Google Chrome understand the actions available on a website. It also creates and displays animations, sound effects, and other interactive features in online minigames, such as Facebook games.

 If JavaScript is disabled, Facebook games may not work properly or may not load at all. Therefore, if Facebook games are not loading in Chrome, make sure to[enable JavaScript](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-javascript-chrome/) .

 When you visit a website, your browser stores copies of certain files on your computer to load that website faster the next time you visit. These files contain images, scripts, links, and various other details of the website and are together known as cache data.

 However, cache data can sometimes get corrupted, which can cause various problems in your browser, including the one you're having. So, if Facebook games are not loading in Google Chrome, try[clearing Google Chrome's cache data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) .

### 4\. Uninstall Problematic Extensions

 You can install all sorts of extensions in Google Chrome to improve your productivity. However, some extensions may do more harm than good.

 Facebook games may not load because of interference from an installed extension. To check for this possibility,[turn off all extensions in Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) and then try to play the games.

![Extenstions page of Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/extenstions-page.jpg)

 If they load and run properly with all extensions disabled, then one of the extensions you disabled was causing the problem. To narrow down that extension, start enabling extensions one at a time until the problem reappears.

 Once you have identified the problematic extension, you can download any available updates for it or consider uninstalling it.
