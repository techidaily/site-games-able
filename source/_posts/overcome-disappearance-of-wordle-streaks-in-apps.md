## Overcome Disappearance of Wordle Streaks in Apps

 It has been a while since Wordle took the internet by storm, and many of us still love playing the game daily. With daily play, we continue to see our streaks get longer and longer, showing our dedication to the game.

 However, streaks seem to get reset sometimes. When this happens, it's upsetting to see as we've worked hard on our scores. If your Wordle streak was reset, hope is not yet lost, and there are a few things you can try to get it back.

## Why Your Wordle Streak Is Gone

 Your Wordle streak will disappear if you delete your browsing history, delete your browsing data, or reset your phone. Some users have also reported traveling can [reset their Wordle streak](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-wordle-streak-iphone-android/) . This might have something to do with time zone changes.

 Your Wordle streak might also disappear if you added the Wordle shortcut to the home screen on your mobile device. We're not sure why this is the case, as bookmarks also use the same mobile browser where your original streak was. You can resolve this by continuing to play on your mobile browser.

 If you love Wordle, but once a day isn't enough, you should also consider these [six Wordle clones](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-wordle-clones-for-iphone/) before trying to get your streak back.

## Can You Get Your Wordle Streak Back?

 Once your Wordle streak is gone, it's difficult to get it back. There used to be a way to get your score back by going to the old Wordle website, but unfortunately, that website has shut down.

 There is now only one way to get your Wordle streak back. This involves changing the date on your phone. To do this, head to your**Date & Time** settings and turn off**Set Automatically** (this may look different on Android devices).

 Once you do this, change the date to the previous day or the day it seemed your streak disappeared. After doing this, head to the [Wordle website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) in your mobile browser. You will then do the Wordle from that date.

 Once you finish the puzzle, set your date and time back to the current day. If it worked, you should see your Wordle streak re-appear when you return to the mobile site. If you only see a two-day streak, you can keep trying this method until you get your old streak back. However, this may take some time if it's a long streak.
