## 1\. Jump King

![The top of the tower in base Jump King](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jump-king.jpg)

 If you just discovered[what Foddian games are](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-foddian-games/) , chances are you’ve heard of Jump King. It’s a massive title in the community, the completion of which holds a lot of sway. Jump King is one of the easiest Foddian games to grasp because of its simple mechanics.

 The primary objective is to get to the top of the map by jumping from platform to platform while navigating any obstacles you might encounter. This game has a somewhat medieval pixel art, which is one characteristic of classic 2D platformers.

 The knight has two primary mechanics. You can move the character from left to right on a platform. However, the focal function of the knight is his ability to jump. There are three jumping stages depending on how long you hold down the jump key.

 The short jump is more of a hop and can be used to traverse a long platform quickly. This feature is a lot more useful to experienced players. The medium jump has a little more power and can be used to bridge a small gap.

 On the other hand, the long jump requires a player to hold the jump key down for some time. It launches the knight across a great distance and can be used to clear large gaps. The knight can also bump into and bounce off of walls. This interaction is crucial for landing on some tricky platforms.

 A player can attempt to finish the game in as little time as possible once they’ve mastered all of these mechanics. What’s more? The game also has expansions that are much harder than the original for gamers looking for a real challenge.

 Overall, Jump King will bring you hours of fun for your first introduction to the Foddian genre. This is one of the factors that makes it easy to recommend.

## 2\. Getting Over It

![A guy in a pot holding a sledgehammer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/a-guy-in-a-pot-holding-a-sledgehammer.jpg)

 Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, often called “Getting Over It,” is often considered the first game to fall under the Foddian game genre, even though it isn’t the first by release date. The game allows you to maneuver Diogenes, the pot-sitting, sledgehammer-wielding character, to help him break the surly bonds of earth and touch the sky.

 Players control Diogenes’ sledgehammer with their mouse and nothing else. It can be rotated around a limited pivot but holds enough power to move the pot-dweller. As such, you’re meant to ascend steep hills and navigate tricky terrain with the sledgehammer alone.

 This makes it more challenging than other games in the genre—especially as it has just one movement mechanic.

 As you’d imagine, Getting Over It is a wonderful choice for streamers who are pressed for time and unable to[plan their live stream](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-to-do-before-going-live/) . This is because the game is frustrating and draws a natural rage that viewers often find amusing. In addition, the difficulty is appealing for speedrunners and Foddian game enthusiasts with a bit more experience with the genre.

 So, if you want to sink deeper into this unique and intriguing game genre, Getting Over It is worth exploring—to say the least.

## 3\. Pogostuck

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The experience of attempting to beat Pogostuck is summarized in the official title, Pogostuck: Rage With Your Friends. You play as a caveman on a pogo stick, attempting to scale large hills, garden-themed locations, and more to get to the top—like other Foddian games.

 You can move the caveman around as a player and jump on the pogo stick. The pogo stick has an interesting recovery mechanic that launches the caveman higher when they fall from a greater height. One can also rotate the caveman and launch them at an angle for a greater jump distance.

 Pogostuck is tough to complete but also great for a relaxed playthrough, as it is one of many[Steam Deck-compatible games](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-steam-deck-compatibility/) . It also has a multiplayer function, which the previously mentioned titles do not. As such, you can play with your friends and other players online while live tracking when someone completes a course in the same session as you.

## 4\. Bread & Fred

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Bread & Fred builds on the existing Foddian formula but adds unique elements that completely alter the gameplay flow. It’s a two-player game that follows the journey of Bread & Fred, two adorable penguins who want to reach the snow-capped summit. Both players must work together to get the penguins to the very top.

 Besides the two-player nature, one major difference between this game and other Foddian titles is the movement options. Both players can move the penguins left or right, jump, grab surfaces, swing using the tether binding them together, and anchor themselves by crouching. The map is designed around these mechanics—as certain areas are only accessible using the right movement options.

 Teamwork and synergy are important in this title, making it an excellent choice for players trying to get their friends into Foddian games. However, the developers also recognize the significance of the game's speedrunning aspect.

 As such, they released a single-player mode that chains one of the penguins to a counterweight that a single player can control. This appeals to speedrunners who would prefer to trust in their skills alone during a run. The developers also released a timer as another quality-of-life addition for speedrunners.

## 5\. Only Up

![Gazing down at the world limit on spine in Only Up!](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gazing-down-at-the-world-limit-on-spine-in-only-up.jpg)

 Only Up! has helped redefine the Foddian genre, challenging what it means to be a Foddian game. It is the only 3D title on this list, but it still contains the key traits of a good Foddian game. The goal is to help a teenage boy, Jackie, escape his life while learning about the word as he ascends to the top.

 Only Up! was developed in Unreal Engine 5, one of the most powerful 3D graphics engines on the market, and it shows in the game quality. Many of the game’s assets come from the Unreal Marketplace, but the developer found a way to organize the chaos. The result is a unique climbing experience as you traverse from one cultural biome to another.

 The game has simple mechanics; Jackie can walk, dash, jump, and climb in any direction. In addition, there are beds hidden across the map that give a small boost when jumped on. The map is massive, and players have limited control of Jackie when he falls. This leads to substantial progress resets that can be tough to recover from.

 Only Up! was at the top of the livestreaming world for almost a month, but the hype has since died. What the game lacks in replayability, it more than makes up for in difficulty. All the same, reaching the top and triggering the final cutscene feels incredibly rewarding.

 Sadly, as of September 2023, Only Up! has been pulled from the Steam store, as reported by[PCGamesN](https://www.pcgamesn.com/only-up/steam-removed) , because the game kept the developer "under a lot of stress" and they want to move on and "put the game behind \[them\]". And while many fans look forward to a return of this Foddian hit, there's no concrete evidence pointing that way.

## It’s About the Journey

 Foddian games are all, at their core, a passion project. The growth of this genre’s fanbase shows how much the creator’s passion has reached players around the world.

 And hopefully, after checking out some of the Foddian games on this list, you’ll be one of those players.
