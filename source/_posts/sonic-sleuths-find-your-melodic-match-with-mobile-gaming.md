 How much do you know about music? More specifically, are you good with song titles and artist names? Can you name a tune as soon as you hear a few notes?

 If this sounds like you, then it's time to put that knowledge to the test. These fun, free music trivia games will challenge your musical ear and have you singing a new song when you win.

## 1 SongPop - Guess The Song

Close

 Even if you've never played the original SongPop, SongPop is a must-have music trivia challenge. You play against others in a race against the clock for correct answers. Listen to the song and then select the answer, whether it is the song title or artist, as quickly as you can.

 Since players take turns at their own pace, this is one of those mobile games you can play when you have just minutes to spare. Plus, each player chooses the playlist for their turn.

 Do well, and you earn in-game coins that you can redeem for additional song lists. You'll find something for everyone here. The game covers a huge variety of music genres and artists, and decades of tunes.

**Download:** SongPop for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU43416/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.freshplanet.games.SongPop3&hl=en%5FUS) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/songpop-guess-the-song/id1528066727) (Free, subscription available)

## 2 Trivial Music Quiz

Close

 If you like a bit more variety than just the "guess this song" trope in your music trivia games, Trivial Music Quiz could be the game for you. You do, of course, have to identify songs. But there is also a wide variety of more interesting questions, such as guessing which instrument a certain musician plays or what band a musician might be in.

 Trivial Music Quiz does have a pop-up that appears the first time you open the app, asking for your support in keeping the game free for users by allowing it to track your data across other apps. This could turn users off, but you are not forced to agree. You still get full access to all aspects of the game if you deny the request.

 There are also a number of ads in Trivial Music Quiz, but the game itself is interesting enough to ignore them. If you dislike any ads in your mobile games, however, there are plenty of [free games with no ads or in-app purchases](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-mobile-games-no-ads/) you can check out.

**Download:** Trivial Music Quiz for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trivial-music-quiz/id1312876895) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU43416/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topquizgames.themedquiz.music&hl=en&gl=US) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 3 Heard-It Music Trivia Game

Close

 The Heard-It Music Trivia Game is perfect for those who enjoy a challenge. On the first go, you only get to hear a one-second clip of the song. You can then guess the song or skip to get another second. Eventually, you do get to listen to a decent chunk of the song, but guessing right after a mere second clip would be both satisfying and impressive.

 Unlike some of the other games on this list that give you four or five options to choose from, there are far more song choices in Heard-It. The options aren't infinite, but there are dozens you can guess from, so the game doesn't narrow it down for you much at all.

 It also offers a link to the song on Spotify if you happen to love the featured song, which is yet another brilliant detail in Heard-It that makes it an excellent option for any music buff.

## 4 Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game

Close

 Maybe what you really love the most is music from the 90s. If so, then Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game is one to check out. First, choose from endless or timed game modes. Then, get ready for quite a challenge. The questions include song titles, lyrics, albums, artists, and even years.

 As you earn coins for doing well, you can redeem them for adding more time, receiving hints, or skipping questions. Note that this game goes a little heavy on the ads.

 But if you can get past the ads, Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game is a super challenging trivia game for fans of that era of music.

**Download:** Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU43416/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.top.nineties.music.trivia.quiz.game) (Free)

## 5 Guess The Song Pop Music Games

Close

 Do you think you’re good at song lyrics? If so, then Guess The Song Pop Music Games is for you. Pick from pop, 90s, or 2000s music and turn up your volume.

 You’ll have the lyrics spoken to you or, if you’re lucky, you’ll hear a song clip. Then tap to select the correct song from the four possible titles. Score for your correct answers and lose points for those you guess wrong. You can climb the leaderboards, complete the achievements, and test your knowledge of lyrics with the game.

## 6 Guess The Song – Music Quiz

Close

 Guess The Song is a fun name-that-tune game available on Android. Put on your listening ears and answer as quickly as you can. You can pick from pop, rock, or country, or jump directly to your favorite decade of music.

 Continue scoring and earning coins to unlock new levels. You can connect to Facebook to see how you compare to your friends. Guess The Song is a terrific music trivia game to enjoy the tunes you love while you challenge yourself.

## 7 Jingle Quiz

Close

 Rather than dealing in the business of popular songs like most of the other apps on this list, Jingle Quiz offers you a selection of jingles to identify. The tunes featured are all from extremely popular franchises or companies that will be at least somewhat familiar to everyone, so you don't have to worry about missing out because the jingle is from a company you don't recognize.

 The jingles are all iconic sounds you've most likely heard at least once in your life. But the app does offer hints, just in case you need a little extra help on some of the tougher questions!

## 8 Songpop Classic - Music Trivia

Close

 Songpop Classic is a very popular and highly rated music trivia game. As you open the app, you will be prompted to select three out of nine music genres. This ensures you will be answering questions related to the type of music you actually like and are interested in, which is a feature many other music trivia games lack.

 You can also go head-to-head with real people and flex your music trivia skills with players from all over the world.

 The downside to this, however, is that you need an internet connection to play and enjoy Songpop Classic. This probably won't be a problem if you're playing at home, but you might have to look for another [mobile game to play when you have no internet or data](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fun-mobile-games-no-data-wi-fi/) , if you're on public transport or away from an internet connection.
