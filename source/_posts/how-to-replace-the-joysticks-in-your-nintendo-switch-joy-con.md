## How to Replace the Joysticks in Your Nintendo Switch Joy-Con

 If you own a Switch and you have for a while, the chances are you will be all too familiar with Joy-Con drift. Some of us can’t help but shudder when we hear the words and can almost hear our wallets begin to cry from the depths of our pockets. It's such a common and frustrating dilemma, in fact, that it’s worth learning how to fix it yourself.

 Replacing your own joysticks is a simple process, but it is also daunting, so we have documented the entire process for you in this guide and will walk you through every step of the way.

## Why Would I Need to Replace the Joysticks in My Joy-Con?

 The components in Joy-Con are so compact that the parts wear down at a much faster rate than other controllers. There is also no wiggle room for any of the dust or debris that can work its way into your controller over time.

 When either of these things happens, your controller will start drifting. Drifting occurs when your joystick senses incorrect input and starts to move on its own, almost like your game is playing itself. Unfortunately, though, it’s definitely not as good at that as you are.

 Once a Joy-Con has drift, there is little you can do to fix it. There are, however, several tricks you can try to[fix Joy-Con drift on your Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-fix-joy-con-drift-nintendo-switch/) before you open it up and take matters into your own hands. The first thing you should try when you notice drift in your Joy-Con is to calibrate them using the calibration tool in the Switch’s menu. That may help for a while, but it is more of a Band-Aid and doesn’t fix the root of the issue.

 You can also[send your Joy-Con away for a free repair](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-send-joy-cons-off-for-free-repair/) . This is a great service, but you aren’t guaranteed to receive the same Joy-Con back. So, if you send a limited edition pair, there is a chance you may get the classic red and blue Joy-Con back. Some gamers aren’t willing to take that risk.

 When all the above methods fail, learning how to replace your faulty joysticks yourself is the best option. It is worth noting, however, that doing so voids your warranty. But if your warranty has already run out, and you would rather fix your pair for around $10.00 rather than pay $79.99 for a new set, you don’t really have much to lose.

* 2.0mm Phillips head screwdriver.
* Plastic prying tool.
* Needle nose tweezers.
* A replacement joystick. These are universal, so don’t worry about having to locate a left or right one.

 It isn’t compulsory for the replacement, but you would also seriously benefit from using a small dish to keep all your loose screws.
