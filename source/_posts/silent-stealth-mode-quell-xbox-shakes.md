## Silent Stealth Mode: Quell Xbox Shakes

 Rumble features, haptic feedback, and general controller vibration are staple elements of gaming. But you might find persistent vibration features more abrasive than complimentary.

So even if a game requires vibration, and you disable the feature, you can always switch it back on. But how do you universally turn controller vibration on or off for Xbox Series X|S?

## What You Need to Know Before Turning Off Vibration on Xbox

 Generally, turning off controller vibration for your Xbox controllers is quite simple, but it comes with a few caveats you should be aware of:

* By universally turning off controller vibration, any supported controller could be affected, even if you use a third-party controller. However, because of the variations of third-party controllers, you may not be able to alter and customize it in the same way as an Xbox Wireless Controller.
* As mentioned, some games may rely on controller vibration for gameplay mechanics or even ways of solving puzzles. Because of this, you may need to retroactively alter controller vibration based on the game you are playing.
* Universally turning off controller vibration affects your controller**Profile** . This means that vibration will remain off even if you replace your controller, as your Xbox will automatically utilize the same**Profile** .

 But aside from the practical caveats of altering controller vibration, the most common way you might otherwise be hindered is due to physical issues with a controller. A build-up of dirt, for instance, can cause stick drift or non-responsive vibration motors, and you may need to[take your Xbox controller apart](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-controller-how-to-take-apart/) to fix any vibration problem.

## How to Disable Controller Vibration on Xbox Series X|S

 With**Turn on vibration** unchecked and disabled, your current controller**Profile** will have vibration universally disabled no matter what game or app you use on your Xbox. Inversely, if you ever want to re-enable vibration, simply go back into**Vibration settings** and ensure**Turn on vibration** is selected.

 If you ever switch your controller**Profile** or reset a**Profile** to default settings, your vibration preferences would be overwritten. In this case, you would need to[configure your Xbox Series X|S controller](https://www.makeuseof.com/configure-xbox-series-s-x-controller/) again to ensure vibration is disabled.

 So, by customizing your controller settings to your preferences, you can even go on to do the same for your Xbox Series X|S to help guarantee your gaming experience.

### Q: Does Controller Vibration Affect Your Xbox Controllerâ€™s Battery Life?

 In short, yes. Enabling controller vibration on your Xbox Wireless Controller for Xbox Series X|S will cause the battery to drain much faster than if you were to disable the feature. The extra power utilized by the vibration motors drains the battery life of your controller much faster than other controller inputs.

### Q: Why Do Xbox and PlayStation Use Haptic Feedback?

 The Xbox Wireless Controller for Xbox Series X|S and the PlayStation 5 DualSense Controller use haptic feedback to enhance your immersion in a game. Put plainly, by using smaller and more precise rumble effects, haptic feedback allows for intricate and accurate reflections of your gameplay when compared to standard controller vibration. However,[the ways haptic feedback enhances immersion](https://www.makeuseof.com/force-haptic-feedback-games/) are broad and even extend to targeting your senses.
