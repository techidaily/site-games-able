## Seeking Silent Players: 4 Ways to Find Disconnects

 When Xbox friends constantly appear offline, it can be a pain to organize online gaming sessions or, at worst, a sign that someone is avoiding you. But with an Xbox Series X|S, there are a few ways you can tell if someone is appearing offline. Let's take a look.

## 1\. Check the Friends & Community App on Your Xbox Series X|S

 On Xbox, one of the main ways you can track online behavior is through the**Friends & Community Updates** app. From here, you can view any game captures, achievements, or posts from your friends. And the best part? Even posts from friends appearing offline are shown through the app.

 If one of your friends has a post on the**Friends & Community Updates** app but has been offline for a while, they are more than likely appearing offline. To check the**Friends & Community Updates** app for friends appearing offline, follow these steps:

* From the home screen of your Xbox, select**My games & apps** .
* Highlight the option for**Apps** , and select**Friends & Community Updates** .

* Find the displayed posts under**Shared by friends** .
* Scroll through the listed posts, looking for one of your offline friends.

 If you find a recent post by an offline friend, you know they are appearing offline. And through the type of posts you find, you can see the games, achievements, or captures your friend has posted.

## 2\. View the Xbox Series X|S Gamerscore Leaderboard

 Aside from searching through Xbox posts, a quicker way of telling if someone has been appearing offline involves viewing the monthly**Gamerscore leaderboard** on your Xbox Series X|S.

 The**Gamerscore leaderboard** is a monthly tracker of all of you and your friend's earned Gamerscore for the month. And, much like the**Friends & Community Updates** app, it also tracks the earned Gamerscore of offline friends.

 So, you can use the**Gamerscore leaderboard** to tell if offline friends are still unlocking achievements, and by association, appearing offline. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X|S.
* Navigate to the options for**People** , and select**Gamerscore leaderboard** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

* Look through the rankings of you and your friends, looking for an offline friend who has been consistently earning Gamerscore.

 If you know someone hasn't been online for the duration of the time the**Gamerscore leaderboard** has been tracking Achievements, but you can see they have earned Gamerscore, they are appearing offline.

## 3\. Look Through Your Xbox Friendâ€™s Achievements

 While the past few methods help you to tell if someone is appearing offline for a long period, there are more direct ways to tell if people are offline on Xbox.

 Instead of viewing the trends of the**Gamerscore leaderboard** , if you have a friend in mind, you can specifically look at recently unlocked Achievements. This way, you can see on the day if a friend has been earning Gamerscore. To analyze a specific friend's Achievements, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X|S.
* Highlight**People** , and select**Friends** .
* Find and select the friend you want to check and choose**See full profile** .

![A screenshot of an Xbox Friend profile on Xbox Series X with the option See Full Profile highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3163.jpg)

* Under**Social** , highlight**Activity Feed** to see recently unlocked Achievements.

![A screenshot of an Xbox Friend Activity Feed on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3173.jpg)

 From here, you should be able to see your friend's most recently unlocked Achievement and how long ago it was unlocked. You know your friend is appearing offline if they are offline but have unlocked Achievements recently.

 Alternatively, you can[compare gaming statistics with a friend on your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-compare-gaming-stats-with-friends/) to provide direct Achievement comparisons with the games you have been playing.

## 4\. Use the Time Played Feature for Specific Xbox Games

 A final way you can tell if one of your Xbox friends is appearing offline is by checking a friend's**Time played** statistic in a specific Xbox game.

 Because Xbox allows you to[check the time played for any Xbox Series X|S game](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-time-played-on-xbox-series-xs/) , if you have a game you know the offline person has been playing, you can tell in real-time if they are playing a game despite being offline. To do this, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu on your Xbox.
* Highlight the options for**People** and select**Friends** .
* Select your friend's Profile.
* Highlight**Gaming** , and select a game.

![A screenshot of the Gaming option available on Xbox Series X when comparing two Xbox Profiles](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3169.jpg)

* Scroll down the on-screen gaming stats until you find**Time played** .

![A screenshot of the Time Played statistic on an Xbox Series X for a specific Xbox game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3166.jpg)

 With stats for**Time played** on-screen, you can check how much time the friend has put into the selected game. If you suspect them of being offline, you can check the**Time played** stat again to see if they have put more time into the game while seemingly offline.
