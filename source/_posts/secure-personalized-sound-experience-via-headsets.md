## Secure Personalized Sound Experience via Headsets

 In the past, consoles like the PlayStation 4 would automatically mute your device audio when you attach a headset to your controller, guaranteeing sound only plays through your headset. But on Xbox consoles, like the Xbox Series X|S, this feature is disabled by default, making you mute your TV every time you use your headset.

 Luckily, correcting this problem is quick and easy. So, if you want to ensure that audio output prioritizes attached headsets and mutes all other output devices on Xbox Series X|S, we can help.

## How to Ensure Audio Automatically Goes Through Your Xbox Headset

 Having to constantly turn down or mute your TV to stop your Xbox audio output from doubling up is a small inconvenience, but one that can become quite annoying with repetition. To correct this problem, and ensure audio automatically switches to your attached headset, follow these steps:

* Press the Xbox button to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the tab for**Profile & system** , and select**Settings** .
