## What Is a Stream Bot, and Why Do I Need One?

![Phone with Twitch Chat](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/phone-with-twitch-chat.jpg)

  A stream bot is a tool that you can use to manage your chat, so you can focus on the game instead of the admin side of things. In terms of exactly what a bot can do, the sky is the limit. You can use bots to run competitions for you, remind you and your viewers to stay hydrated, or even moderate your viewers by blocking or removing bad eggs from your chat.

 Each of these functions can benefit you as a streamer because it automates features you would otherwise have to perform yourself. That gives you more time to focus on the important things, like smashing that next boss and actually interacting with your viewers.

 Creating an interactive stream is the key to success. You can[add channel points to create a more interactive Twitch stream](https://www.makeuseof.com/twitch-channel-point-ideas/) and level up your chat, but utilizing bots is yet another[essential Twitch feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/twitch-features-every-user-should-know/) every streamer should know about.

 The problem with bots is that there are countless options out there, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. To add and use a bot in the first place also requires connecting it to your Twitch account itself, and you don’t want to share such sensitive information with any random program. You want to make sure the bot you choose is safe, trustworthy, and reliable. The following options tick all of those boxes.

## 1. Nightbot

 Nightbot is one of the most popular chatbots, and for good reason. It is 100% safe and just as reliable. Some bots have a habit of somehow disconnecting from your stream for strange and unknown reasons, leaving you having to log in and reactivate them manually. Nightbot, however, doesn’t suffer from this issue.

 There are also countless functions you can set Nightbot up to do in your stream. You can set up song requests to allow your viewers to curate your playlist (beware of copyright if you use this feature), moderate giveaways so you can treat your viewers without dealing with the behind-the-scenes stuff, and even set up automated timers to remind your viewers about, well, anything.

## 2. StreamChat AI

![MyAiBot Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/myaibot-website.jpg)

 The artificial intelligence boom has seen AI being adopted into many different facets of our lives, including streaming. Many bots use AI, but StreamChat AI is powered by a highly advanced AI with its own sassy personality to spice up your stream.

 That is what helps StreamChat AI stand out from the rest of them. Rather than dishing out monotonous and robotic replies, StreamChat AI has its own mannerisms and personality that make it a more lively and relatable part of your chat. You can also customize StreamChat AI’s personality to suit your stream style.

## 3. StreamElements

![StreamElements in chat](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/streamelements-in-chat.jpg)

 StreamElements is another very popular choice for streamers and is specifically designed to go hand-in-hand with the streaming software OBS. It offers all the best chatbot features like timers, reminders, giveaways, and commands and provides a stable connection that you can rely on.

 StreamElements can also hook you up with all sorts of sponsorships, so you can help grow your audience and support your streaming habit. These usually involve streaming a certian game and offer monetary incentives based on the number of viewers you can get to sign up and play the games as well.

 StreamElements is one of the easier chatbots to use, and with all the features it offers, along with possible sponsorship deals, it’s easy to see why it is one of the most popular chatbots among streamers.

## 4. Streamlabs Cloudbot

 If you use Streamlabs to run your stream instead of OBS, you should consider using Streamlabs Cloudbot. This bot is designed to work seamlessly with Streamlabs to moderate your chat, and since you already trust Streamlabs with your Twitch account, you don’t have to give permission to any outside programs as well.

 You can still use Streamlabs Cloudbot even if you don’t use Streamlabs streaming software, but it may disconnect occasionally. Streamlabs Cloudbot offers fully customizable commands for your chat to use and engage with, like quotes for example.

 Your viewers can type in !quotes and get a random quote that you have said on stream in the past. You do have to upload the quotes yourself, however, but this is easy to do before you start or even during the stream.

## 5. Moobot

![MooBot Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/moobot-website.jpg)

 Moobot is a brilliant and high-quality chatbot that you can use to moderate your chat. Streamers have little control over who enters their chat, and there are some bad eggs every now and then that will need banning for whatever reason. It can be hard or near impossible for streamers to see every comment and stop their stream to[block someone on Twitch](https://www.makeuseof.com/block-unblock-twitch/) , especially when the chat is blowing up. That’s where moderators come in.

 But you can’t always count on your moderators to be around. They are human, too, after all. Moobot provides an automated alternative, so streamers can still protect their chat even when no moderators are present.

## 6. DeepBot

![Deepbot Website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/deepbot-website.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012415/19272" target="_top" id="2012415">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/>

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012415/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 DeepBot prides itself on being one of the most customizable bots out there. It allows you to name the bot whatever you would like and even offer your own loyalty point system separate from channel points to reward your viewers.

 This allows you to customize those features to strengthen your own brand name and presence without having to actually create your own bot. DeepBot also has little games your viewers can play in chat to stay entertained while you’re taking a break or focusing on something else.

 When your viewership really starts ramping up your chat can easily become overwhelmed, and it becomes all but impossible to carry conversations with individuals in your chat. Offering little games for people to play while they watch your stream allows them to feel more involved in your chat without any extra effort on your behalf.

## 7. CoeBot

![CoeBot Twitch Commands Scree](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/coebot-twitch-commands-scree.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 CoeBot is a smaller bot that has yet to make it big in the Twitch scene, but it offers solid features and is a reliable option for your stream. CoeBot has all the classic chatbot features like commands, quotes, and moderation capabilities.

 CoeBot offers a more simplified and stripped-down experience when compared to some of the other flashier bots on this list. But it is easy to use, and the plus side to CoeBot is that it already has many of the more popular chat commands pre-installed, so you don’t have to spend ages creating them as you do with the other bots.

## Worry Less and Maximize Your Streaming Fun With a Bot

 You’ve already got enough to worry about during your Twitch stream between the countless technical difficulties and internet issues. Sometimes, it’s reassuring to know your bot has your back in chat. Particularly if you’re running some sort of giveaway or your bot is moderating for you and keeping your stream safe.

 If you’ve been streaming, and you don’t have a bot yet, any of these options could be a complete game changer for you and even help you grow your stream.
