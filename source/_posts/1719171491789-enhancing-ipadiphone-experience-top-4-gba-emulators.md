### Quick Links

 If you're eager to relive your childhood memories by playing all the classic GBA games on your iPhone, you're in the right place, as we'll be guiding you through the best Game Boy Advance emulators available for iOS devices.

 Using emulators to play games is within legal bounds; however, it's crucial to note that downloading and installing ROMs for games you don't own is strictly illegal.

## 1 Delta

 Delta is easily one of the best GBA emulators for iOS devices. It's packed with features like controller support, save states, and the option to speed up gameplay to get through tedious sections.

 You can [install Delta by sideloading it through AltStore](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-sideload-iphone-apps-without-jailbreak/) , and it can not only emulate GBA games but also run SNES, Nintendo DS, N64, and Sega Genesis games.

 Delta also supports local multiplayer, and it even has full AirPlay support, meaning you can [wirelessly connect your iPhone to a TV](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-mirror-the-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-tv-ios/) and mirror the gameplay while using your iPhone as a controller.

 Overall, Delta is an excellent option if you're looking to emulate not just GBA titles but a range of Nintendo's retro consoles.

## 2 Provenance EMU

 Provenance EMU, also available through AltStore, offers features similar to Delta, such as saving progress anywhere you want and controller support.

 However, what makes it stand out is that it even has a specific version for tvOS. So, you can install it on your Apple TV, connect a controller, and effectively turn it into a gaming console that can run thousands of retro games.

 It even lets you sync your saves using iCloud, making it the perfect option if you want to pick up your progress on another device, like your iPhone.

 Provenance EMU also supports a wide range of retro consoles, including Sony's PlayStation 1, making it more versatile. However, its user interface often feels very clunky and lacks several customization options compared to Delta.

## 3 RetroArch

 If you've tried emulating games on other devices, you must've heard of RetroArch. It's by far the most capable emulator out there and provides a ton of features, such as support for online multiplayer, and you can even [use RetroArch's shaders to emulate the look of a CRT TV](https://www.makeuseof.com/make-retro-games-look-like-used-to-retroarch-shaders/) .

 RetroArch is also the best multipurpose emulator, as apart from the traditional Nintendo consoles, you can even emulate PSP, PS2, DOS games, and more.

 It's worth noting that installing RetroArch can be a bit of a hassle, and there is an even steeper learning curve in setting it up. If you're only planning on simply emulating GBA games without any massive modifications or tweaks, it's better to opt for Delta or Provenance EMU instead.

## 4 AfterPlay

 If you're uncomfortable with sideloading apps on your iPhone, AfterPlay offers a convenient alternative as a browser-based emulator. This means you can play GBA games directly through Safari or any other web browser without having to sideload apps.

 You can simply head to the website, load your GBA ROM, and start playing. However, since it's browser-based, its performance tends to be more sluggish compared to the other emulators we mentioned. A reliable internet connection is essential for a smooth gameplay experience.

 AfterPlay also has automatic cloud saves, so you can pick up your progress on any device as long as you're using the same account. While GBA emulation is free, accessing other consoles like the Nintendo DS or PlayStation 1 and features like fast-forward, cheats, and multiple save slots require a premium subscription.

 While none of these GBA emulators for iOS are available on the App Store due to Apple's policies, you can safely sideload them using AltStore. If you already own a bunch of GBA classics, you can transform your iPhone into a retro gaming powerhouse with the right GBA emulator.
