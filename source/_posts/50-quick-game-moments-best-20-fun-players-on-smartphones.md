 All the games are available for free on Android and iOS, though they contain optional in-app purchases.

## 1 iSlash Heroes

Close

 Sharpen your blade and prepare for iSlash Heroes. Your goal is to slash pieces of the board away until the meter reaches the red ribbon. The trick is to watch out for the bouncing ninja stars because if you hit one, you lose a life.

 The more pieces you remove, the less space there is for the stars to move.

## 2 Fishing Break

Close

 Fishing Break is a casual and colorful challenge. You hop into your boat and travel to different watery worlds, catching fish and creating a collection. Swipe to cast, then tap and hold to reel in your catch. Just be careful not to pull them in too quickly, or they may break the line.

 You can earn coins for the fish you sell and use them to unlock better fishing spots.

## 3 Doodle Jump

## 4 Polyforge

Close

 Polyforge is a relaxing mobile game. As the crystal rotates, you time your taps to imbue each side with color. But be cautiousâ€”if you hit the same side twice, you must start again.
