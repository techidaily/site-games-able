## Top 10 PC Adventures From the Latest Google Play Game Beta

 The Google Play Games beta is set to shake up the Android game emulator scene. It offers an alternative to the likes of BlueStacks and NoxPlayer, with the promise of optimized versions of mobile games.

 Not all mobile games translate well to PC, though, regardless of the emulator you choose. If you're keen on trying the Google Play Games beta, here are the 10 titles that translate best from mobile to PC.

## Google Play Games on PC
![Google Play Games game information page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/google-play-games-information-window.jpg)

 The [Google Play Games beta](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2028958/https://play.google.com/googleplaygames#section-overview) is available for testers in various regions worldwide. It's an official Android emulator for Windows created by Google and is set to be one of the best BlueStacks alternatives out there. You can install Android games on PC with this beta and even though it doesn't have all the features that come with other emulators, game developers actively work with Google to create versions of their titles optimized for PC.

 One of the best features of the Google Play Games beta is that progression is saved on your account across all devices. And, since it's an official program from Google, it's the safest emulator for you to use for logging into your Google account. You may have also noticed that some emulator games may run poorly regardless of your computer's specifications. Well, the Google Play Games beta looks to optimize titles to run better on your PC and allow changes to some games' control schemes. That is, games will, at least, either run better or offer more control scheme options.

 After [installing Google Play Games on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/android-games-windows-11-google-play-games/) , you'll want to consider trying the following games, as they're some of the best in terms of how well their PC port functions in the Google Play Games beta. It's really great to play these titles without having to slouch over your phone, and, in some cases, using a mouse and keyboard is much more comfortable overall. Keep an eye out for the performance indicator at the top left and the optimization box at the bottom right of each game's installation page, though sometimes these aren't entirely accurate.

## 1\. Idle Superpowers
![Two cartoon characters fighting in a game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1946.jpg)

 It's safe to say that idle games are some of the most popular titles for mobile devices. Idle Superpowers is one of the best idle games on the Google Play Games beta. It runs very well, but the nature of the game requires that you leave it open and running, as progression is limited to 10 levels and won't pass bosses unless the game is open and running. If you do this on mobile, you'll quickly drain your phone's battery.

 Playing this on a PC keeps you from using your phone's battery for extended periods, and it also runs much better on desktop. It's worth noting that you can't get ad rewards, though.

## 2\. Gems of War - Match 3 RPG
![Login screen for Gems of War game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1935.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Gems of War is a mobile game that's not available for PC unless you download an emulator or, in this case, the Google Play Games beta. There's no dramatic shift in terms of swapping to mouse and keyboard, but the gameplay is comfortable enough with just a mouse. However, it runs very well, and the visuals are impressive on a larger display.

![Gems of War gameplay showing gems and characters](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1941.jpg)

 As with all titles on the Google Play Games beta, progress is saved across all devices.

## 3\. Cookie Run: OvenBreak
![Login screen for Cookie Run game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1925.jpg)

 Cookie Run: OvenBreak is the first mobile game on this list with impactful control changes on the port to PC. For gameplay, you can press F to jump and J to slide, and you can change these hotkeys in the settings menu. Its performance is another story, though, and it's highly recommended that you change the graphics settings to low and disable background animations.

![Gingerbread man in Cookie Run game running and collecting items](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1933.jpg)

 You're also in for a long wait while it installs. It took me over 45 minutes to finish installing this title on the Google Play Games beta. But the gameplay is smooth, and the controls make it especially enjoyable.

## 4\. Island War
![Island War main screen with village in background and batte button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1950.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Island War victory screen with soldiers celebrating on boat](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1952.jpg)

Close

 Island War is the only game on this list that runs in portrait mode, but don't let this stop you from giving it a try. Yes, it only runs in portrait mode, but it has straightforward controls. Using a mouse for unit placement feels better than tapping a screen on a mobile device.

 Organizing units in boats also feels more engaging on a PC than on a phone. It's a great mobile game port to play on PC, as it has both active and idle elements.

## 5\. Towerlands: Tower Defense TD
![Splash screen for Towerlands](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1910.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Towerlands: Tower Defense TD is another mobile game that translates well to PC. It has idle and active gameplay elements, and using a mouse makes the gameplay more engaging when it comes to selecting units and upgrades. While the graphics don't get much love, the gameplay is relaxing and worth trying.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The visuals in this game are identical to the mobile version in every way, but the performance feels better, and I still found it quite enjoyable.

## 6\. Botworld Adventure
![Character sleection screen in Botworld Adventure game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/botworld-adventure-character-screen.jpg)

 The Botworld Adventure Google Play Games beta port is simply fantastic. While it doesn't have WASD movement support, the mouse settings work the same way mobile does. That is, you can use click-to-move or click-and-drag in any given direction to move. Unit placement in combat, as well as menu navigation, are easy and intuitive.

![Botworld Adventure gameplay exploring open world](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/botworld-adventure-exploration.jpg)

 The game is well-optimized for desktop and runs well even at the highest graphics settings. While hardware can be a factor, most computers can probably run this better than most cell phones.

## 7\. Hungry Shark Evolution
![Hungry Shark Evolution login screen with shark in middle of screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hungry-shark-evolution-home-screen.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Hungry Shark Evolution is one of the best ports from mobile to PC via the Google Play Games beta. It downloads, installs, and loads very quickly. One of perhaps its only drawbacks involves its visuals, which can seem noticeably poor on larger monitors and screens.

![Hungry Shark Evolution keyboard controls](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hungry-shark-evolution-keyboard-screen.jpg)

 The game boasts full keyboard configuration support. The control layout is fantastic, making the game very easy to play, fun, and intuitive to control.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Hungry Shark Evolution is an instant classic, running smoothly on PC. Careful, though; I found this one to be quite addictive.

## 8\. Idle Heroes
![Login screen for Idle Heroes game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1915.jpg)

 Idle Heroes is one of the better idle games to play on the Google Play Games beta. It has a simple UI, you don't need to use a keyboard, and playing this game on a PC will save your phone's battery a lot of wear. The game's resolution adapts to larger screens, so visuals are clear on almost any display.

![Characters battling in Idle Heroes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/idle-heroes-battle-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The gameplay loop is simple but can entertain for hours. It's worth mentioning that Idle Heroes codes do, in fact, work on the Google Play Games beta port of the game. So, if you're playing the game for the first time and want to use codes, you can start on PC.

## 9\. Shop Titans: RPG Idle Tycoon
![Overhead view of a small shop with people making purchase requests](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shop-game-overhead-screenshot.jpg)

 If you typically shy away from complex [management and city-building games](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-city-building-games/) , Shop Titans: RPG Idle Tycoon on the Google Play Games beta might be for you. It's a simplistic and fun idle management game that's great for running in the background when multitasking. It's one of the better options to alt-tab to throughout your day, all without having to unlock your phone.

## 10\. Summoners War
![Login screen for Summoners War](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-1918.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Summoners War offers a great mix of idle and active gameplay mechanics, which makes it another fantastic choice for playing on PC. It's also one of the more in-depth idle games available on the Google Play Games beta, with hero, building, and combat management.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 The main screen is a pleasant sight, even though it's identical to the mobile version. Ad rewards aren't available on PC, but everything else functions properly. Using a mouse instead of tapping on a screen is much more comfortable, and, as with a few other games on this list, it's a great game to run in the background when you're multitasking.
