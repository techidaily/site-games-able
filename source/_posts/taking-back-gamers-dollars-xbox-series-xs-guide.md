## Taking Back Gamers' Dollars: Xbox Series X/S Guide

 There are many incredible games on the Xbox Series X|S, but for every hit, there are bound to be some misses. So what happens if you accidentally order the wrong game package or you’re just not happy with your purchase? If that happens with a physical product, you would usually take it back to the store and get your money back if you’re eligible.

 Thankfully, you can do this with your digital purchases on the Xbox Series X|S as well. If you want to request a refund but you’re not sure where or how to, we will walk you through the process below.

## Do I Qualify for a Refund on the Xbox Series X|S?

 If you're a fan of gaming, you will be well versed in how expensive it is and are likely always looking for[ways to save money with your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-ways-to-save-money/) . And refunding purchases that you aren't satisfied with is certainly one of them.

 While it is possible to return a digital game or product on the Xbox Series X|S, there are some limitations. The two main factors that can affect the success of your refund request are as follows:

1\. You must request your refund within 14 days of the purchase date.

 2\. You can’t have played the game in question for a significant amount of time.

 The definition of what exactly a ‘significant amount of time’ is isn’t explained on[Microsoft’s website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) , but it likely depends on the game. For example, if you’re returning a five-hour-long game and you’ve played it for two hours, that’s almost 50% of the game that you’ve experienced. But if the game in question is 50 hours long and you’ve played it for two hours, you’ve only experienced a fraction of it.

## How to Request a Refund for a Digital Game on the Xbox Series X|S

 Requesting a refund for a digital game on your Xbox Series X|S is thankfully very simple and is very similar to[refunding purchases on the PS4 or the PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-game-ps4-ps5/) . You can't do so from the comfort of your console, however. You will have to head to[Microsoft’s website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) to get started

1. Head to[support.xbox.com](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) or just click the link to be taken straight there.
2. You will then need to log into the Microsoft account that you used to purchase the game in question. You can log in by pressing**Sign in** at the bottom of the page or in the top right corner.
3. Once you’ve logged in, scroll down to the**Request availability** section. If there is a valid game there, click the box beside the title and press**Request a refund** to bring up the request form.

### What Happens if the Game I Want to Refund Isn’t Listed?

 There are several reasons why the game you want to refund isn’t listed on the returns page. If you would like more information on what items will or won't be available there, click**Why don't I see my purchase on the list?** It is worth noting that subscriptions and preorders don’t show up in that section, so that could be a contributing factor.

 In most cases, if the game in question doesn’t show up on the returns page, it is non-refundable for one reason or another. In that case, it might pay to go back and review the details of your purchase and make sure you are eligible for a refund.

## What Happens Once My Refund Request Is Accepted?

 If your refund request is successful, you can expect to see an email from Microsoft confirming this, and you will be able to see your refund being processed in your Microsoft account. You will also have your access to the game revoked, so it will no longer be playable.

![Microsoft account order history page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/microsoft-account-order-history-page-1.jpg)

 To check your Microsoft account and see if your refund is being processed, head back to the Microsoft website and click your**user icon** in the top right corner. Select**My Microsoft account** , and head down to your**Order history** . If your refund was successful, you will see**Refunded** next to the game title.

## Make Sure You Request Your Refunds Before It’s Too Late

 Video games can be extremely expensive, and no one likes being disappointed with a product, especially when it's pricey. The main thing to remember when it comes to requesting refunds on digital games or purchases on the Xbox Series X|S is to sort it out quickly. 14 days is a decent window, but time can easily get away from us.

 It’s also a great idea to stop playing as soon as you realize you have purchased the wrong product or that you’re unhappy with it. The definition of what is considered a significant amount of gameplay isn’t specified, so it’s better to be safe than sorry.
