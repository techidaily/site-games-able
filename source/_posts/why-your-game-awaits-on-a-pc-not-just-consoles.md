## Why Your Game Awaits on a PC, Not Just Consoles

 Video games are sneaking their way into more and more facets of our lives. There are many incredible consoles on the market, and mobile gaming has improved to the point where phones can easily handle playing games made for consoles. But one of the original gaming machines is still just as prevalent today as it ever has been: the PC.

 The PC is an absolute beast for gaming. There are many reasons why it is the best place to experience your favorite games by far, and more and more console gamers are making the switch. Here’s why.

## 1\. PCs Are More Powerful Than Consoles

 PCs are far more powerful than consoles. When you strip it down, gaming consoles are just miniature computers that are capable of many of the same things. But there have to be some sacrifices made to shove a computer inside a relatively small gaming console.

![Woman playing games on PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Woman-playing-games-on-PC.jpg)

 In most cases, there is nothing ‘mini’ about a PC, and there are some absolutely monstrous gaming PCs out there. At the end of the day, a PC is far more powerful than any console. And as a result, they simply run games better.

## 2\. PCs Have Better Graphics Than Consoles

 The power exhibited by a PC allows you to experience games at peak performance in every way. This also applies to graphics. PCs have top-of-the-line graphics cards which are dedicated to visual fidelity. These technological marvels can produce graphics of up to 8K resolution.

 PCs also offer a much higher FPS rate.[What FPS means in gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-fps-meaning/) can change depending on the context. But in this case, we are referring to frames per second. Frames are the many images that create a motion picture. Think of when you draw a doodle on the bottom corner of your notebook and quickly flick through the pages to bring your character to life. This is what is happening in your video game. The more frames you are seeing per second, the smoother your picture becomes.

 Gaming PCs can consistently produce over 100 FPS. They can also display your picture in up to 8K resolution while maintaining acceptable FPS. This is more than double what some consoles are capable of.

## 3\. You Can Upgrade Your PC

 One of the best features of a PC is that many of them are modular. Parts are purchased separately and individually connected to the motherboard. This means you can replace parts without having to replace your entire machine.

![A close image of a gaming PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gaming-pc-with-rigb-lights.jpg)

 If you feel like your console doesn’t have good enough graphics, that’s pretty much just too bad. There is not much you can do to fix that problem besides upgrading to the next console.

 If you feel like your PC graphics card could do with an upgrade, you are free to purchase a new one and replace that particular part while still keeping the rest of your machine the same. This provides much more freedom than a console can offer.

## 4\. PCs Are Easier to Repair Than Consoles

 The modular design of a PC not only makes it easier to upgrade but also makes it far easier to fix. If one part kicks the bucket, simply unplug it from your motherboard and replace it with another.

 Fixing consoles yourself can be complicated, and it's not recommended unless you have experience in the area. If something goes wrong with your console, the best option is to send it away to be repaired or replaced by the production company rather than opening it up and trying to fix it yourself. Doing so will actually void any warranty you may have on your system.

 Some parts may be built into your PC. But parts like graphics cards, RAM, and hard drives, can simply plug into the motherboard and are not complicated to replace.

## 5\. You Can Use Your PC for More Than Just Gaming

 When you purchase a gaming PC, it just means it has parts that are powerful enough to run the most demanding games. It doesn’t mean it is only suitable for that purpose. You can use a PC for almost anything within the digital realm.

![coding and open pc](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/protect-your-site-from-xss-attacks.jpg)

 Many people work from their PCs, scroll the internet, watch movies, make movies, create art and illustrations, and even make video games. The list truly goes on. If you're looking for a career change, you can even stream video games from your PC. Consoles are brilliant for gaming and sometimes streaming, but[streaming to Twitch from your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stream-ps5-to-twitch-broadcast-feature/) or Xbox is far more difficult.

## 6\. PCs Have More Digital Options

 If you’re a person who likes to live without a lot of clutter, a PC could be the perfect place to store your gaming library. Many PCs these days don’t have a disk drive. All of their data and games are stored digitally.

 Consoles usually don’t offer a lot of storage space straight out of the box. If you have a lot of digital games, you will most likely need an expensive storage upgrade to fit them all on your system. For this reason, many gamers opt for physical purchases where most of the game's data is stored on the disk rather than the console.

 If you like to keep your shelf space free for things other than video game cases, PC gaming can help you transition to a digital library.

## 7\. PCs Have More Games Than Consoles

 PCs also offer more games than consoles in general. Many games are created on PC and then ported to consoles later on. In some cases, games will release on PC first as the porting process can take a lot of time and effort for developers to complete.

 Video game consoles are at war with each other, for lack of a better term, with each company fighting for the top place in the gaming market. Because of this, many games are exclusive to certain consoles. A lot of those games eventually make their way over to PC, however, which seems to be a more neutral party.

 This is especially true in recent years with the arrival of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on PC. PlayStation has begun releasing many of its console exclusives on PC as well.

## 8\. A Mouse and Keyboard Offer More Control Than a Controller

 When it comes to gaming, a mouse and keyboard beat a controller any day. You have far more control over your movements with a mouse and keyboard, and many gamers opt for them for competitive play for this reason.

 Have you ever lost to a player who seems to have impossibly rapid reaction times in an FPS game? They are probably using a mouse and keyboard. And we are sure every console gamer knows the struggles of desperately attempting to type out a reply in Among Us with a controller.

 Using a mouse and keyboard is so widely accepted as being superior that crafty gamers are constantly seeking out ways to[connect a keyboard and mouse to the Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-how-to-connect-keyboard-and-mouse/) and other consoles.

## 9\. Most Video Game Controllers Are Compatible With PC

 Gaming with a mouse and keyboard is superior for many gamers, but not all. There are still plenty of people out there that prefer a classic handheld controller. But since controllers can vary in so many ways, every gamer has a favorite.

![A Gaming PC With an AIO Cooler and a Many Fans](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/a-gaming-pc-with-an-aio-cooler-and-a-many-fans.jpg)

 Many controllers are only compatible with their own respective platforms, however. This means you can't use your DualSense to game on your Switch, for example. That's not the case with PC, though. Most controllers can connect to your PC, so you can always game with your favorite.

## 10\. Many Games Are Cheaper on PC

 PC games are almost always cheaper than their console counterparts. There are many reasons why this is the case, but to name just a few, developers don't have to factor in any extra manufacturing, shipping, or licensing costs.

 Brand-new games can even be up to $10.00 cheaper on PC than on console. So even though the initial cost of buying or building your PC may be more than a console, you will be saving money over time on the cost of your video games.

## Experience Games the Way They Were Intended on a PC

 PCs are far more powerful, have better graphics, are more customizable, and are also far more versatile than consoles.

 There are very few cons to gaming on a computer, and that is why more and more gamers are ditching their consoles every day. If you're looking for the best experience that gaming has to offer, you will find it on PC.
