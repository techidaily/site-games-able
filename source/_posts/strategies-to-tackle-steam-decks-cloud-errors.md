## Why Am I Getting a Steam Cloud Sync Error?

![screenshot of a steam deck cloud sync error](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_of_steam_deck_cloud_sync_error.jpg)

 Cloud sync errors are fairly common on the Steam Deck, often affecting multiple games at a time. If a simple restart doesn't fix the problem, the errors can stick around for a while and make it difficult or impossible to play your games.

 Unfortunately, it's not currently known why this issue is so widespread, or what the cause is. It's likely that the cause is somewhere on Steam's side, which leaves the user without any permanent fixes.

 However, it's still possible to temporarily fix this issue, and get on with your gaming session.

## 1\. Reconnect the Wi-Fi

![screenshot of the steam deck settings wi-fi option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_of_steam_deck_settings_wi_fi.jpg)

 The first step you can try is a simple one. To toggle the Wi-Fi off, hit the **Steam** button and scroll down to **Settings.** Then head into the **Internet** category.

 Toggle **Enable Wi-Fi** off, then back on. It's important you try to launch the game after this so that it attempts to sync to the cloud again.

## 2\. Enter Offline Mode

 If toggling the Wi-Fi produced no results, try to enter offline mode on the very same screen. After you hit **Enable Offline Mode**, restart the device so that it launches into offline mode fresh. Then, disable offline mode and attempt to launch your game.

 This can often force the cloud sync to work, as syncing save data is a crucial part of exiting offline mode.

## 3\. Check for Updates

![screenshot of the steam deck settings update menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_of_steam_deck_settings_update_channel.jpg)

 There is a chance that an update could fix cloud syncing errors. In **Settings,** head up to the **System** category. Hit the first option, **Check For Updates,** and apply any that are applicable.

 If you're feeling adventurous, you could change the **System Update Channel** to either **Beta** or **Preview**, which will provide you with experimental builds if the stable channel doesn't have the fix you need.

 Be careful, as beta and preview builds can contain unexpected bugs and might even corrupt your drive. In this case, [you would need to restore SteamOS with a recovery image](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restore-steamos-on-steam-deck/).

## 4\. Disable Cloud Sync

 This next fix brings us out of the settings menu. Instead, head to the library page for any of the affected games. Hit the **gear icon** and go into **Properties**. Scroll down in the General category until you find the **Steam Cloud** header.

 Disable the **Keep game saves in the Steam Cloud** option. Launch the game, keeping in mind that you're not currently synced to the cloud.

 Exit the game after a short time and re-enable cloud sync for the game. Next time you launch the game, it should sync to the cloud and ask you which save file you'd like to use.

## 5\. Clear Compatdata Files

 This method is the most reliable way to force a successful cloud sync, but is the most hands-on. You'll need to be familiar with [Steam Deck's desktop mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-use-steam-deck-desktop-mode-without-dock/) and be comfortable using i[t](https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-use-steam-deck-desktop-mode-without-dock/).

 Launch into desktop mode and navigate to the following folder:

.local/share/Steam/steam apps/compatdata

 In order to access the .local folder, you'll need to have enabled hidden folders.

 The compatdata folder will contain folders all named with different assortments of numbers. Any file in this location that is not a folder is a stuck file that is failing to sync. Simply delete these files and restart into gaming mode.

 Try to launch a game and the cloud sync error should be resolved.

## Steam Deck Sync Issues Are Easily Fixed, but Hurt the Experience

 While this issue is widespread and can be frustrating, it's a good thing it's relatively easy to fix. Unfortunately, constantly fixing cloud sync issues when you're trying to play your games can really hurt the handheld experience.

 With any luck, a fix for this recurring issue comes sooner rather than later.
