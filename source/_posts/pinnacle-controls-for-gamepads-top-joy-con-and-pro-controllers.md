## Best Nintendo Switch Controller Overall: Nintendo Switch Pro Controller

![A Nintendo Switch Pro Controller on a table](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/nintendo-switch-pro-controller.jpg)

 Corbin Davenport / MakeUseOf

 Taking into consideration quality, performance, and features, the[Nintendo Switch Pro Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU35504&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-controllers%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) takes the crown. If you've used PlayStation or Xbox controllers, you’ll be surprised by how comfortable the Pro feels in your hands.

 It comes down to the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller’s button layout. The triggers and face buttons are larger, which is far better, especially if your hands feel cramped using Joy-Cons. It also has an actual D-pad as opposed to the separate directional buttons. The textured grip is the cherry on top.

 The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is also one-for-one with Joy-Cons as far as features go. You still get Amiibo support, motion controls, an NFC reader, and HD rumble. And the semi-transparent style is a nice touch!

![switch pro controller](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/switch-pro-controller.png)

##### Nintendo Switch Pro Controller

Best Overall

 If you prefer a traditional controller, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is the next best thing. It has all the same built-in features as the Joy-Cons, excluding splitting into two halves.

**Pros**

* Better for long gaming sessions
* All curves and no sharp angles
* Perfect replacement if you find the Joy-Cons too small
* Semi-translucent design is a treat to the eyes

**Cons**

* Name brand comes with a premium cost

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use a third-party controller with the Nintendo Switch?

 Yes, you can. In fact, most of the controllers featured in our list are third-party controllers, and they work perfectly. Depending on the third-party controller, it'll either work as soon as you plug it in or after you've attached an adapter.

### Q: Can I use a PS5 controller on the Nintendo Switch?

 Yes, but it involves using an adapter. If you prefer a slimmer, more traditional controller, you can easily[connect PS4 and PS5 controllers to the Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-connect-ps4-ps5-controller-to-nintendo-switch/) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Q: Can a pair of Joy-Cons be used as separate controllers?

 Indeed, they can. It doesn't work for every game on the Nintendo Switch, but many of Nintendo's first-party titles can be played with a single Joy-Con, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

### Q: Are Joy-Cons still susceptible to stick drift?

 Unfortunately, yes. The good news is that you can send your[Joy-Cons to Nintendo for a free repair](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-send-joy-cons-off-for-free-repair/) , even if your system's warranty has expired. However, if you're a tech-savvy individual, you can always[fix Joy-Con drift yourself](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-fix-joy-con-drift-nintendo-switch/) .
