## PlayStation Finances & Trending Games

 Gone are the days when you needed to line up at your local games store to buy the newest games. Launched in 2006, the PlayStation Store has made it convenient for fans of Sony to buy games for its consoles from the PS3 onwards.

 So long as you have funds in your PlayStation wallet, you will be able to buy games on the store. Adding funds and buying games is simple, quick, and easy.

## What You Need to Know About the PlayStation Wallet

 All adult PlayStation Network (PSN) accounts have an online wallet that can be topped up using registered payment methods. Upon creation, child accounts have a spending limit of $0 that can be adjusted by the PSN account family manager.

 While PSN Wallet funds do not expire, there are wallet limits per region, such as $375 in the United States and £150 in the United Kingdom. PSN Wallets can make PlayStation Store purchases within the PSN region where you purchased your funds. For example, you will not be able to use your PSN Wallet funds in GBP in the US PlayStation store, or vice versa.

 Now that you know about the PSN Wallet, we’ll walk you through the various payment methods to pay for games on the PlayStation Store.

## How to Add Funds to Your PlayStation Network (PSN) Account

 There are three main ways that you can pay for games (and other items) on the PlayStation Store:

1. Credit/Debit Cards.
2. PayPal.
3. PlayStation Store Cards.

Here’s how to load your PSN wallet through each method:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Credit or Debit Cards

 Using your PlayStation console, go to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Payment and Subscriptions > Payment Methods** . Once you have entered your password, select**Add a Credit or Debit Card** , input your card details, and confirm.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Credit and debit cards only work when your address matches the region of where your PSN account is registered. You may link a maximum of three credit or debit cards to your PlayStation wallet.

 Due to the Address Verification System (AVS), users commonly experience verification issues when paying for games on the PSN store using credit or debit cards. To fix this, check if your card is compatible with AVS by calling your bank, and be sure to type exactly how your bank statement shows your address.

 Additionally, avoid using special characters such as hyphens, apostrophes, or slashes. Spell out numbered street names, remove anything that signifies direction, and replace any special characters with the closest letter in the Latin alphabet. PO boxes and military addresses are also currently not accepted.

 If you prefer, you can link a PayPal account to your PSN account instead.

### 2\. PayPal

 Using your PlayStation console, go to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Account > Wallet > Payments and Subscriptions > Payment Methods > Add a PayPal Account** and confirm your log-in details.

 Select**PayPal** under**Payment Methods** , choose the top-up amount, and authorize your payment.

![The Add PayPal as payment method screen on PlayStation 5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ps5-add-paypal.jpg)

 Be sure to check the PayPal list of countries that support PSN direct payments. Remember that you can only register one PayPal account to one PSN account at a time. Alternatively, PayPal gives you the option to buy PlayStation Store cards directly from its website.

 If your country does not allow PayPal direct payments, or you prefer to keep your personal details private, you may opt to purchase PlayStation Store cards instead.

### 3\. PlayStation Store Cards

 To redeem a PlayStation Store card, go to the **PlayStation Store > More (three horizontal dots) > Redeem Code** . Input the 12-digit code from your card, and select**Redeem** .

![The redeem code page on the PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ps5-redeem-codes.jpg)

 You can purchase PlayStation Store cards from a number of different retailers. Bear in mind that some vouchers will require activation from the retailer and will be valid a year up after purchase.

 Now that you know all the ways that you can load money onto your PSN account wallet we can proceed to the fun stuff.

 If you have changed your mind about a game you have purchased on the PSN store, you have 14 days to[request a refund on PlayStation 4 or 5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-game-ps4-ps5/) . For pre-orders, you may ask for a refund up until the official release date.

 Should you be unhappy with a PlayStation subscription, you may also request a refund with the appropriate deductions depending on how much you have used the service.

 Please note that once you have downloaded or streamed your purchase, you are no longer eligible for a refund unless the content is faulty. For any kind of refund or cancelation, you can send a message to[PlayStation Support](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/contact-us/) .
