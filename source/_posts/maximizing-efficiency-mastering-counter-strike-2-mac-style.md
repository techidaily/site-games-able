## Configuring CrossOver for Counter-Strike 2

1. Close the Steam window, and open CrossOver again.
2. Select the**Steam** bottle and toggle on**D3DMetal** on the right. This will enable[hardware acceleration via DirectX](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-directx-why-important-for-gaming/) and translate all API calls to Metal.
