## How to Ensure Audio Plays Only Through Your Headset on Xbox Series X|S

 In the past, consoles like the PlayStation 4 would automatically mute your device audio when you attach a headset to your controller, guaranteeing sound only plays through your headset. But on Xbox consoles, like the Xbox Series X|S, this feature is disabled by default, making you mute your TV every time you use your headset.

 Luckily, correcting this problem is quick and easy. So, if you want to ensure that audio output prioritizes attached headsets and mutes all other output devices on Xbox Series X|S, we can help.

* Press the Xbox button to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the tab for**Profile & system** , and select**Settings** .
