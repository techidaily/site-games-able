## Effortlessly Turn On PS5 with These 6 Tips

 The PlayStation 5 is full of surprises and secrets. Even if you’ve had yours for years, there are probably still plenty of things it can do that you don't know about. Even things you take for granted, like turning it on, for example.

 Did you know that there are approximately six different ways to turn your PS5 on? Most of them don’t even involve you touching it or being anywhere near it at all. If you want to trick your friends into thinking your PS5 is haunted by turning it on when they're alone in the house, there are a couple of ways you can do so.

## 1\. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the Power Button

 Pressing the power button is the most common way that gamers turn their trusty PS5s on. Almost immediately after taking your brand new PS5 out of the box and plugging it in, your trigger finger is just itching to press that power button and see what all the PS5 hype is about. And that is probably how you still turn it on to this day.

 But it is also, by far, the most boring way to turn on your PS5\. Not to mention the most labor-intensive since you have to lift yourself out of the couch and walk yourself all the way over to it. Thankfully, there is a much easier way. In fact, there are a number of easier ways.

## 2\. Turn Your PS5 On in Safe Mode

 But before we get to the easiest and most convenient ways to turn your PS5 on, there is one other way to turn your console on using the power button, and it’s quite possibly the most important one of them all. That’s turning your PS5 on in Safe Mode.

![Safe Mode Menu On PS5 Console](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/safe-mode-menu-on-ps5-console.jpg)

 You can turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode by holding the button down for six to eight seconds until you hear a second longer beep. Safe Mode allows you to access the backend of your system, where you can address many technical issues you may be having with your console.

 Hopefully, you will never have to turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode, but it can be a lifesaver if you've been experiencing issues so it's important for every PS5 owner to know about[what Safe Mode is on the PS5 and how to use it](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-safe-mode/) .

## 3\. Turn Your PS5 on Using Remote Play

 If you’ve got yourself all rugged up on the couch and leaving the warm embrace of your safe space doesn’t quite appeal to you, you can also turn your PS5 on with your mobile device. This is an excellent way to turn your PS5 on without moving an inch, but it does require a little bit of pre-planning.

 To turn your PS5 on via Remote Play, you must have downloaded the Remote Play app and connected it to your PS5 console previously.[Setting up Remote Play and using it to operate your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-how-to-set-up-and-use-remote-play/) is quick and easy and allows you to do much more than just turn it on. With Remote Play, you can fully control your console through your phone, so you can play an entire campaign on your mobile if you want to.

## 4\. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the PS Button on Your DualSense Controller

 If you didn’t know that you can turn your PS5 on by pressing the PS button on your DualSense controller, your mind is about to be blown. This is by far the easiest way to turn your PS5 on, because even if your console may not always be within arm's reach, there is a good chance your DualSense is calmly waiting for you on your coffee table.

![Person Playing On PS5 DualSense Controller with RGB Lights](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/person-playing-on-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-rgb-lights.jpg)

 And what's easier than picking up your phone and pressing several buttons to find the PS or Remote Play app to turn your PS5 on? Picking up your DualSense controller and pushing one single button instead.

## 5\. Turn Your PS5 on Using the PS App

 If you don’t have Remote Play downloaded and set up on your PS5 yet, don’t worry! You can also turn your PS5 on through the PS App.

 This is a different app than Remote Play, and it doesn’t allow you to play games via your phone, but it does have a lot of its own functionality. You can see screenshots you’ve taken on your console through the PS App, review trophies you’ve collected, as well as add and chat with friends.

 And, of course, you can turn your PS5 on. To do that, make sure your console is in Rest Mode, open the app, press the**controller icon** at the bottom of the screen, and scroll to the game you want to play. As long as the game is currently installed on your PS5, you will be able to press**Play on Console** , and your PS5 will turn on for you.

## 6\. Turn On Your PS5 With Your TV

 For those extra avid gamers out there, there is yet another way you can turn your PS5 on without going anywhere near it. You can set your console up to turn on as soon as you turn on your TV. This feature can be activated in a just couple of moments from your console’s settings.

 It is only recommended for the most dedicated of gamers, however, who know that a majority of the time they turn their TV on, it will be to use their PS5\. If not, it can be more bothersome than helpful to have your PS5 turning on every time you want to watch Netflix or the news. That just wastes power and requires more effort from you to turn it off again.

 Thankfully, it is just as easy to[stop your PS5 from turning on with your TV](https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-ps5-turning-on-off-with-tv/) as it is to activate the setting in the first place.
