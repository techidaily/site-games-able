## Elite Portable Games Using Gamepad Controls

 Mobile gaming has come a long way since the days of Snake and Tetris on classic Nokia phones. Now, you can play full-featured games on your mobile device. Sometimes, with quality that's equal to consoles like the Nintendo Switch or PlayStation Vita.

 With so many options for mobile gaming, one might consider getting a Bluetooth controller. That way, you can play games like you would on a console but from your phone or tablet.

 If you’re looking to take your mobile gaming to the next step, check out the best mobile games that offer Bluetooth controller support.

## 1\. Call of Duty: Mobile

 Call of Duty has an exclusive mobile game which some claim is better than the COD games available on consoles.

 Call of Duty: Mobile features several modes. The most popular is the Battle Royale mode, which features a full-sized map. 100 players drop into the map and gather weapons and materials. The last person standing wins the match.

 There are also classic Deathmatch modes offered, and you can even play on your favorite legacy maps like Nuketown or Shipment. Call of Duty: Mobile is also a great first game to play if you’re looking to [use your iPhone as a game console](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-iphone-into-gaming-console/) .
