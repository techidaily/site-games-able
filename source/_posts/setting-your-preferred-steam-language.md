## Setting Your Preferred Steam Language

 As the most popular gaming platform, Steam lets users from different parts of the world change the default language.

 Maybe you want to change Steam’s language so you can navigate and interact with the platform more efficiently. Or you want to practice a foreign language, and you want to incorporate Steam games into the language learning routine. At the time of writing, Steam has official support for 29 languages across many platform features, so there's a chance you can find the one that you want.

 No matter the reason, you can change Steam’s default language by going through the steps below.

## How to Change Steam's Language on Desktop

 Despite being the most popular gaming platform, Steam will run into the occasional issue. When this happens, it helps to change the Steam language, so you can better understand the issue and fix it faster.

 If [you’re having trouble playing Steam games](https://www.makeuseof.com/troubleshoot-windows-steam-games-not-playing/) , here’s how you can change its language before fixing the issue:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Open the Steam menu from the top-left corner and select**Settings** .
3. From the left pane, click**Interface** .
4. Open the drop-down menu below**Select the language you wish Steam to use** and select a new language.

## How to Change Steam’s Language Online

 Steam will not sync the change across multiple platforms. However, changing the language on Steam for the web is a straightforward process. Click your username and go to**Choose language** . There, select the option that suits your preferences.

 Now, if you need more control over the language settings, you’ll have to sign in. Then, click your username and go to**Preferences** . There, open the**Language Preferences** menu.

 Use the**Primary section** to select your preferred language. If your preferred language isn’t that common among game developers, it’s better to choose one of the options from the**Secondary language** section.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Tap the**hamburger menu** from the bottom-right corner.
