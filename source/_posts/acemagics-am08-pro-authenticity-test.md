## AceMagic's AM08 Pro: Authenticity Test?

### Key Takeaways

* The AM08 Pro is a compact and affordable gaming PC that is suitable for casual gamers and teenagers looking for a powerful and reasonably priced gaming option.
* It has the capability to run AAA games and supports up to three 4K displays, making it a versatile choice for gaming and multimedia purposes.
* While it may not be suitable for hardcore gaming and may require graphics quality adjustments for newer titles, the AM08 Pro delivers impressive performance and expandable options at a budget-friendly price.

 Want to play the latest PC games but don’t have the space for a hulking games PC? Fancy something compact that won’t break the bank, yet give you adequate graphics to play an AAA title?

 It sounds unlikely, but such hardware is now available. While desktop GPUs have grown, motherboards have shrunk. The result is something like this: the AceMagic AM08 Pro, a gaming PC smaller than most laptops.

 But does it actually deliver? Can you really play the best recent games on this system, or does it just sit on your desk looking RGB-pretty?

## What Ships With the AceMagic AM08 Pro?

 In some ways, the AceMagic AM08 Pro from AceMagician is a PC retailer’s dream. It’s reasonably affordable and ships in a tiny box that makes it cheap to store and distribute.

But what is in that box?

![ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-vents.JPG)

 You get the PC, measuring 5.89 x 3.06 x 7.42 inches (weighing 863 grams, or 30oz), a mains power adapter, power cable, HDMI cable, and a quick start guide. Unsurprisingly, you’ll need to provide your own keyboard and mouse and any other peripherals or input devices.

 Setting it up takes a few seconds, and within a minute you can be configuring Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. Of course, getting through the Windows 11 setup can take a while, and once that's done you’ll need to install a gaming platform or sign into PC Game Pass.

 But once you’re done with that, it’s time to start installing and playing games.

## Who Is This Mini Gaming PC For?

 Usually, when reviewing computers, it is clear who the device is aimed at. A laptop for anyone who needs to work anywhere (office/coffee shop/train/school or college). Desktop PCs are for office-anchored staff, small shops, or ticket management at legacy entertainment businesses (bowling alleys, cinema chains, etc.).

 At the other end of the scale, Raspberry Pis are for enthusiasts, tinkerers, and makers.

So who would want an AceMagic AM08 Pro?

![ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro in bedroom](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-bedroom.JPG)

  I’ll tell you: teens. More specifically, teenagers who want an upgradeable system for gaming (unlike a laptop). Kids over 12 that are looking for a system that has the space and processing power to handle 4K video authoring.

 Fortunately, I have a couple of children in this exact age range. One of them, Bruce, has helped by providing space in his bedroom and considerable time testing various games.

## AceMagic AM08 Pro Device Specifications

 Two versions of the AceMagic Pro PC are available: the AM08 AMD model and the AD08 Intel variant (with an Intel Core i9 CPU). We received the AMD model, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU (8 cores, 16 threads) with an AMD Radeon 680M GPU. (This is the same GPU as the [GPD Win 4 handheld](https://www.makeuseof.com/review-gpd-win-4-handheld-console-review/) ).

 The reviewed computer has 32GB of DDR5 RAM (a 16GB option is available), upgradable to 64GBs, with a 512GB M.2 SSD (PCIe NVME) and 4 x USB 3.2 Type-A ports (two at the front, two on the back). Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 provide wireless connectivity. Audio in and out can be handled with the 3.5mm port, mounted on the front.

![HDMI and Ethernet ports](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-rear-ports-1.JPG)

 Up to three 4K displays can be connected to this computer. Dual HDMI ports are mounted on the device, along with a USB 4.0 Type-C port. This handles other data besides display output.

 In addition, the power button is mounted on a fan performance selector rocker switch. Affording control over the high-performance dual fans, this switches between Low, Normal, and Performance, with the middle option the default.

![ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro LEDs](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-leds-1.JPG)

 Windows 11 Pro is preinstalled, and the computer comes with AceMagic's 30-day refund and return and a 3-year warranty.

 A quick note on the size: the user guide indicates that the computer can be mounted on the back of a monitor using a VESA attachment, but no plate is included in the box.

Perhaps most surprisingly, this unit is expandable.

## You Can Upgrade the AceMagic AM08 Pro

 The right-hand side of the AM08 Pro (as viewed from the front) is secured only by magnets. Enabling easy access to the RAM and storage media, the side plate is simple to remove and replace, eschewing thumbscrews.

 You'll find an empty SATA port for a 2.5-inch storage device inside. Beneath this is the M.2 storage, while positioned higher in the case are the dual RAM sticks. All of these items can be removed and upgraded with relative ease.

![ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro expansion ports](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-ports.JPG)

 Admittedly, these are laptop-style upgrades, but they’re upgrades nevertheless. It’s enough to give this machine a bit of longevity.

 One thing to note about the hardware is the wireless networking. I live in a small house, and the computer was set up in a room near our router (about 12 feet diagonally). However, there seemed to be an issue maintaining a strong Wi-Fi signal. This isn’t an issue with the room, as a tablet computer is regularly used there.

 This may be a quirk of the review device (I checked with the AceMagic people and the problem could not be replicated), but it was easily dealt with thanks to a powerline adapter. While your own experience may differ, this is worth keeping in mind.

## Gaming on the AceMagic AM08 Pro

 Since this is marketed as a gaming PC, we opted for games that would really push the AceMagic AM08 Pro. Relying on Steam, Bruce installed:

* Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
* Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order (2019)
* Humankind (2021)
* He also tried Minecraft and Apex Legends, seemingly perennially-updated titles

 And… they all played absolutely perfectly. It really is incredible that a small unit like this should be able to deliver such excellent gaming performance.

 In term of noise levels, the system isn’t too bad, although when the selector knob is set to Performance, it does get a bit loud. But it’s still far quieter than a traditional desktop.

 Most importantly, our 12-year-old is seriously impressed, to the extent that he wants to keep it. I’d say that was a pretty good point in the AceMagic AM08 Pro’s favor.

## What About PC Tasks That Aren’t Games?

 Something as small and relatively cheap as the AM08 Pro is likely to attract attention as a gift. With Windows 11 Pro preinstalled, it is ready-made for media production, and suitable for everything from homework to online shopping.

But how does this work out in practice?

![USB Ports](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-usb.JPG)

 To find out, we edited a video, and later I updated my blog. I then made an important Amazon purchase (and as I write this, I’m hoping I remembered to log out...)

 It should be no surprise to read that it handled them all perfectly. But then, all it has done throughout this review is surprise. Sure, it is a tiny computer, but it appears to be just as capable as any standard PC.

## No, It’s Not a Gaming PC, But It'll Do

 By this point, you’re probably thinking one of two things: “There's no way that’s really a gaming PC” or “Wow, a gaming PC for $500!”.

 Both opinions are right. If you’re a hardcore gamer, this system—LEDs aside—is not for you. It’s baseline stuff; cooling control is useful but nothing hardcore, and you won’t be able to push this system to extremes. You need a totally different setup, let’s be honest.

![ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-vents-1.JPG)

 But if you’re new to gaming and found a standard laptop doesn’t do the job, then the AceMagic AM08 Pro will blow your mind. It produces excellent results with recent games, and while you may need to dial back the graphics quality for newer titles, it can still cope.

## An Entry Level Gaming PC Ideal for Teens

 When I was first asked to review the AceMagic AM08 Pro, I was naturally dubious about its billing.

 While the term “gaming PC” isn’t in its official website description, it is listed under gaming devices (along with the more expensive AceMagic G1).

 Yet it has taken me totally by surprise, providing gaming and desktop performance that you can be confident with. With no noticeable performance drops, low latency 4K output, and space to expand RAM and storage, the AceMagic AM08 Pro delivers everything you want from a PC that would typically cost twice as much. It’s as much a gaming system as it is an office workhorse.

 Essentially, this isn’t a “gaming PC” for people who live and breathe games, but it is a gaming PC for people who like games enough to spend a bit of time on them and expect them to be playable. Oh, and teenagers. Teens will love the AceMagic AM08 Pro.
