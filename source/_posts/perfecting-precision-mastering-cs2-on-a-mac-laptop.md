### Key Takeaways

* Mac users can still play Counter-Strike 2 on their devices using CrossOver, despite Valve discontinuing macOS support for the game.
* To install CrossOver, visit the CodeWeavers website and download the trial version or purchase the software.
* After installing CrossOver, download and install the Windows version of Steam, then search for and install Counter-Strike 2 from the Store section. Adjust CrossOver settings for optimal performance before launching the game.

 Counter-Strike 2 has replaced Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but unfortunately for Mac users, Valve has discontinued macOS support for its latest title, citing notably low player counts on the platform. But that doesn't mean Mac users don't have options. Here's how to play the popular title on your Mac.

Fortunately,

## Install CrossOver to Play Counter-Strike 2

 Just because there is no native support for the game doesn't mean you can't play it. CrossOver allows you to run the Windows edition of Counter-Strike 2 on your Mac, ensuring you can still indulge in your preferred esports title. The first step to enjoying Counter-Strike 2 is then, naturally, to download and install CrossOver on your Mac. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Head over to the[CodeWeavers website](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/download) to download CrossOver. You can use the 14-day trial to test it out before committing to a purchase ($74).
2. Ensure your operating system is set to**macOS** , then provide your name and email address. Finally, click on**Download Trial Now** to initiate the download.
3. To complete the installation, simply double-click the**crossover.zip** file you downloaded to extract the app. Subsequently, move the**CrossOver** app to[the Applications folder](https://www.makeuseof.com/applications-folder-mac/) .
4. When you run the app for the first time, you'll come across a prompt asking you to buy or try CrossOver. For now, you can select the**Try Now** option.

## Configuring CrossOver for Counter-Strike 2

 Before launching Counter-Strike 2, it's essential to adjust settings in CrossOver to enhance performance and stability. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Close the Steam window, and open CrossOver again.
2. Select the**Steam** bottle and toggle on**D3DMetal** on the right. This will enable[hardware acceleration via DirectX](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-directx-why-important-for-gaming/) and translate all API calls to Metal.

 By following the steps outlined above, from installing CrossOver to configuring settings for optimal performance, you can successfully run Counter-Strike 2 and experience your favorite esports title on macOS.
