## Safety & Style: Review of Best Steam Deck Shells, '24

 While Valve bundles a carrying case with your brand-new Steam Deck, it still needs a protective cover to keep it safe from bumps, scratches, and drops. On top of that, these protective cases for the Steam Deck are pretty handy for adding a better grip to the handheld, an especially helpful feature for long gaming sessions.

## Best Steam Deck Case Overall: Spigen Rugged Armor

![back and front of spigen rugged armor protective case for steam deck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/back-and-front-of-spigen-rugged-armor-protective-case-for-steam-deck.png)

Spigen

 The[Spigen Rugged Armor](http://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Rugged-Armor-Protective-Steam/dp/B0B75N73N9?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2017777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-protective-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the way to go if you want a solid, comfortable grip and seamless compatibility with the official Valve Steam Deck accessories. It's made with high-quality TPU material, offering an excellent middle ground between hard and silicone cases. It's flexible enough for easy application but not too flimsy.

 The case is thinner and lighter than other Steam Deck protective cases but sturdy enough to offer decent drop protection. It keeps the Deck in a natural and comfortable position on the hand and doesn't get in the way of the triggers, ports, and buttons. The Steam Deck fits perfectly in the official carrying case from Valve with the Rugged Armor on and works with the official dock. Spigen also adds an adjustable wrist strap to complete what is already a perfect protective case for the Steam Deck.

![Spigen Rugged Armor Protective Case for Steam Deck-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/spigen-rugged-armor-protective-case-for-steam-deck-1.png)

##### Spigen Rugged Armor for Steam Deck

Best Overall

 The Spigen Rugged Armor is the best Steam Deck case for most people. It combines reliable protection, a perfect fit, and an excellent grip, all packaged in a stylish yet slim design that adds no extra bulk.

**Pros**

* Thin and lightweight but good protection
* Comfortable
* Fits in the official carrying case

**Cons**

* Not grippy enough

[$25 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Protective-Shock-Absorption-Anti-Scratch-Accessories-nintendo-switch/dp/B0B75N73N9?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2017777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-protective-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

## Best Budget Protective Steam Deck Case: JSAUX Kickstand Protective Case

![JSAUX Kickstand Protective Case attached to valve steam deck-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jsaux-kickstand-protective-case-attached-to-valve-steam-deck-1.jpg)

JSAUX

 If you’re looking for the most bang for your buck, the[JSAUX Kickstand Protective Case](https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Protective-PC0102-Shock-Absorption-Anti-Scratch/dp/B0B27VKBKG?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2017777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-protective-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an easy option to recommend. It’s noticeably thicker than most cases, which is a godsend in the event you accidentally drop your Steam Deck, as that extra thickness adds to its shock absorption. It does make it impossible to connect to the official Steam Deck Dock, but since it’s easy to remove, it isn’t a deal-breaker.

 You won't drop your Steam Deck all too often either, with the textured TPU material, giving it both anti-slip and anti-scratch properties. More importantly, perfect cutouts have been made for all the available ports and vents to prevent heat build-up. It even has a rigid kickstand at the back if you want to prop it up.

![back of valve JSAUX Kickstand Protective Case with stand extended](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/back-of-valve-jsaux-kickstand-protective-case-with-stand-extended.png)

##### JSAUX TPU Cover Protector

Best Budget

 The JSAUX TPU Cover Protector is surprisingly tough for its price, offering a thicker case for better absorption. It even has a textured grip to further prevent slipping in the first place.

**Pros**

* Textured, anti-slip grip
* Thick, shock-resistant TPU material
* Perfect cutouts for ports and vents

**Cons**

* Have to remove the case to dock

## Best Steam Deck Case With Stand: Benazcap TPU Protective Case

![Benazcap Case for Steam Deck with built in stand](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/benazcap-case-for-steam-deck-with-built-in-stand.png)

Benazcap

 The[Benazcap TPU Protective Case](https://www.amazon.com/Benazcap-Protective-Shockproof-Anti-Collision-Accessories/dp/B0B4DGJ15R?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2017777&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-protective-cases%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) provides solid protection from everyday scratches and drops, as well as a built-in kickstand for hands-free desktop gaming. You can prop the Steam Deck up to give your hands a desired break or play local multiplayer games. It's a mechanical kickstand, so it doesn't affect the fan speed or performance of the Steam Deck.

 The case itself is a blend of a shock-absorbing TPU bumper and hard polycarbonate backing. It does an excellent job of protecting the sides and back of the Steam Deck, and the grippy, textured handles provide a really great feel in the hand and a more comfortable hold of the Steam Deck.

![Benazcap Case for valve steam deck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/benazcap-case-for-valve-steam-deck.png)

##### Benazcap TPU Protective Case for Steam Deck

Best with Stand

 Made with a shock-absorbing TPU and rigid polycarbonate backing, the Benazcap TPU Protective Case is as good as most Steam Deck cases when it comes to protection and grip. The real kicker is that it also offers a solid kickstand for when you want to go hands-free.

**Pros**

* Built-in kickstand
* Solid protection for the back and handles
* Perfect fit and precise cutouts
* Excellent grip
* Fits in the official Steam Deck carrying case

**Cons**

* No front protection

SUPCASE

 SUPCASE is no stranger to making high-quality protective cases. Its flagship offering, the[SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle PRO](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SUPCASE-Unicorn-Beetle-Pro-Series-Case-for-Steam-Deck-2022-Rugged-Slim-Protective-Case-with-Kickstand-Dark/1234738683) , has been the go-to rugged case for the Nintendo Switch, phones, and tablets, and the Steam Deck isn't any different. Built with a TPU bumper and a rigid polycarbonate back, this case gives your new Steam Deck the best protection possible. It can withstand drops and shocks better than others, thanks to its solid drop protection that goes above and beyond military standards.

 The Unicorn Beetle PRO covers the entire back and sides of the Steam Deck, adding both extra protection and a better grip. It's comfortable for long gaming sessions and has a sturdy mechanical kickstand for when you need to rest your hands or play games with a controller. One thing SUPCASE does better than other cases is the precise cutouts for ports and buttons. The USB-C port, in particular, has enough clearance for thick and right-angled cables, which comes in handy when using a dock.

HEYSTOP

 It’s no surprise people flock to[Steam Deck skins](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-alternative-skins-for-steam-deck/) for personalization, but they’re pointless if you then attach a case. Luckily, the HEYSTOP Steam Deck Clear Case lets the beauty of the machine shine through while simultaneously acting as tough armor. You’ll gain protection against drops, with the corners absorbing the most shock.

 The HEYSTOP Steam Deck Clear Case is also quite comfortable to hold, given its well-shaped, ergonomic design. Its material is smooth and incredibly easy to clean, too. The only downside is the lack of protection at the front, but since it’s priced fairly, that’s all the more reason to pick a[Steam Deck screen protector](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-screen-protectors-for-steam-deck/) for peace of mind.

### Q: Can I play all Steam games on the Steam Deck?

 In theory, yes. You can even step outside Steam's ecosystem and[dive into Epic Games and GOG](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-install-and-play-epic-games-and-gog-titles-on-steam-deck/) . However, that says nothing about how well a particular game will perform. Like any PC, the Steam Deck has its limits, and some titles may not work as well.

### Q: Is the Steam Deck basically a PC?

 Yes, the Steam Deck is simply a PC in handheld form; in fact, you can connect it to a monitor, along with a[keyboard and mouse](http://www.makeuseof.com/best-keyboard-and-mouse-for-steam-deck/) , and use it like a desktop.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Q: Can I play the Steam Deck on a TV?

 Yes, you can connect the Steam Deck to a TV. You have two choices: connect via a Steam Deck Dock, or the many[Steam Deck Dock alternatives](https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-dock-alternatives/) , or by using a USB-C to HDMI adapter.

### Q: Does Steam Deck come with a case?

 The Steam Deck comes with its own carrying case, but it does not include a protective case. The original Steam Deck carrying case is a pretty snug fit, so you may run into space issues depending on which protective case you choose. It's fairly basic, but there are some excellent third-party[Steam Deck carrying cases](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-steam-deck-carrying-cases/) available.
