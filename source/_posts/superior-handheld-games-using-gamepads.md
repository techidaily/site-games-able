 Call of Duty has an exclusive mobile game which some claim is better than the COD games available on consoles.

 There are also classic Deathmatch modes offered, and you can even play on your favorite legacy maps like Nuketown or Shipment.

## Improve Your Mobile Games With Controller Support

 If you enjoy gaming on your iPhone or Android device, then you might want to consider taking your gaming to the next level and getting a controller. Not only does it improve gameplay, but in some cases it can actually make you better at the game.

 If you’re used to playing on consoles, you can also get a controller to improve your overall experience. Using a controller also lets you see the whole screen, as opposed to using your fingers which can block some aspects of the game.
