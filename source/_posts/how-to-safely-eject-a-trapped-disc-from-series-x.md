## How to Safely Eject a Trapped Disc From Series X

 Having to force a disc out of your gaming console is never ideal, and manually removing a disc from your Xbox Series X is seen as a last resort by Xbox. However, doing so on Xbox Series X is relatively simple and relies on locating a hidden hole at the base of your console.

 To safely access the disc, Xbox suggests utilizing an uncoiled paperclip to access the**Eject Hole** . To remove an Xbox disc from your Xbox Series X manually, ensure you have a paper clip at hand and follow these steps:

* Uncoil your paper clip so that one side is about two inches long and thin enough to fit through a small hole.
* Ensure your Xbox Series X is powered down by unplugging your console from the mains.
* Rest your Xbox on its side, so that you can view your console's base.
