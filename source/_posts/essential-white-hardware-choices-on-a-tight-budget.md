## Essential White Hardware Choices on a Tight Budget

 The dark palette of your typical motherboard is nice, but striking, icy white motherboards can really make your components pop. Of course, it’s purely aesthetics and doesn’t offer any performance benefits, but if you want a specific color scheme for your build, the best white motherboards are a good place to start.

## Best AMD Overall: ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A
![ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A best white amd motherboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asus-rog-strix-x670e-a-best-white-amd-motherboard.png)

ASUS

 If you’re putting together a high-performance AMD build, the [ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-X670E-Motherboard-Cooling/dp/B0BDV6RR2K?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2023999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-white-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is, without a doubt, the strongest contender, especially paired with a powerful [NVIDIA or AMD GPU](https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-gpu-alternatives-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb/) . With its available ports, overclock support, and a bevy of heatsinks, you can really push your rig.

 Want faster load times, smoother gameplay, and a snappier OS? Given its two Gen 5-ready NVMe slots, you can use one for your OS and another for storing your favorite games. As a bonus, there are also two Gen 4 M.2 slots, which are quite useful for older games or ones you only play occasionally.

 The ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A is fitted with an AM5 socket, giving you access to AMD’s powerful Ryzen 7000 series CPUs. That kind of power can run hot, so be sure to install one of the [best AIO coolers](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-aio-coolers/) , too. It even comes with SafeSlot technology, a feature that should be standard since it helps avoid shearing your GPU, especially if it’s girthy.

![ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A all white gaming motherboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asus-rog-strix-x670e-a-all-white-gaming-motherboard.png)

##### ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A Gaming WiFi

Best AMD Overall

 $340$420 Save $80

 The ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A comes out on top, showing off its support for AM5 CPUs, a wealth of heatsinks, and a stylish off-white finish. Above all, it supports PCIe 5.0 for both SSDs and GPUs.

**Pros**

* Easy to work with, including the BIOS
* Supports DDR5 memory
* Can be hooked up to an AIO
* SafeSlot adds additional support to heavier GPUs

**Cons**

* Doesn't support Thunderbolt

## Best Budget AMD: ASRock B650M Pro RS
![asrock b650m pro rs all white motherboard for amd cpus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asrock-b650m-pro-rs-all-white-motherboard-for-amd-cpus.png)

ASRock

 Naturally, budget AMD builds come with sacrifices. Luckily, ASRock did an excellent job designing the [B650M Pro RS](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasrock-b650m-pro-rs%2Fp%2FN82E16813162130) by tightening up its features while still providing many worthwhile benefits.

 For example, while you’re limited to PCIe 4.0 for GPUs, which isn’t a bad thing to begin with, you gain an AM5 socket and DDR5 support in return, the latter of which you can overclock. While its socket does limit your choices to AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series lineup, the ASRock B650M Pro RS is so competitively priced you won’t have a problem finding a CPU that fits your budget.

 Finally, the “Blazing M.2,” as ASRock likes to call it, puts a beautiful bow on the whole package. Ancient HDDs and even lesser SSDs can’t hold a candle to Gen 5 speeds. You not only experience a far more responsive OS, but gaming gains a big boost as well.

 $135$160 Save $25

 For any budding PC builder on a budget, the ASRock B650M Pro RS is one of the most straightforward, user-friendly motherboards you can work with. It isn't oversaturated with ports but instead has everything you need to make a high-end AMD build.

**Pros**

* Great option for compact builds
* Can overclock RAM
* Solid set of ports, including USB-C
* Can save a little more going with the non-WiFi option

**Cons**

 he Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Elite AX ICE also has a wealth of features outside of performance. Its support for ARGB means you can go above and beyond with personalization, even more so paired with one of the [best white PC cases](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-white-pc-cases/) . And if you plan on using high-end components, all that extra thermal shielding on the MOBO goes a long way in keeping everything nice and cool.

 For a more budget-oriented Intel build, the [ASUS ROG Strix B760-A](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-D4-ATXmotherboard-M-2slots/dp/B0BR8VBFM2?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2023999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-white-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a far more economical approach but offers a decent set of ports, Wi-Fi 6E capabilities, and support for GPUs that can take advantage of PCIe 5.0.

 The ASUS ROG Strix B760-A features an LGA 1700 socket, allowing you to pick between 12th and 13th Gen Intel CPUs. This not only gives you the option to settle with a cheaper model—think Intel’s 12400F—but also offers upgrade paths for the future. Just be sure to take advantage of the onboard water cooling header!

 Best of all, the ASUS ROG Strix B760-A is surprisingly easy to work with. Not only does it feature a BIOS FlashBack button but also a Q-Release and Q-Latch, making ejecting your GPU and M.2 painless and, more importantly, avoiding unwanted damage.

Gigabyte

 If the ultimate gaming rig is what you’re after, the [Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Pro X](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Z790-AORUS-PRO-Motherboard/dp/B083RW9TJF?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2023999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-white-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn’t leave anything on the cutting room floor. It sets you up for the best GPUs and CPUs on the market right now, as well as for better upgrades down the road.

 Case in point, the Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Pro X is rocking PCIe 5.0 for both GPUs and SSDs.

 Equally important are the little traits that make the Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Pro X a joy to work with. Its support for ARGB means you can put together a rig that’s as gaudy as you want with the [best RGB fans](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-rgb-fans/) .

### Q: How can I tell if my motherboard has gone bad?

 If your motherboard has been giving you issues, it may give off a beep, fail to post, or have onboard LEDs that light up if there's a problem with your GPU, CPU, hard drive, and RAM. That's only the tip of the iceberg, though, so if you're attempting to troubleshoot your MOBO, it's best to get familiar with the [signs that your motherboard is dead](https://www.makeuseof.com/signs-your-motherboard-is-dead/) .

### Q: Can I use any CPU with any motherboard?

 No. A motherboard's [CPU socket](http://www.makeuseof.com/lga-vs-pga-cpu-socket-whats-the-difference/) will only accept one of two processors: Intel or AMD. You can't use an AMD processor with an Intel socket and vice versa. Now, that still doesn't mean you can use any processor if, say, you have an Intel CPU and an Intel-based motherboard, as they'll only accept specific generations.

### Q: What does CPU stand for?

 CPU is an acronym for "central processing unit." The CPU is analogous to the brain, carrying out the various tasks and processing data.

### Q: Does the size of the motherboard matter?

 Not at all. Board size doesn't impact performance. You can get the same baseline features, whether it's a mini-ITX or the largest E-ATX. The size of the motherboard only comes into play when it comes to whether it can fit in your PC case.

### Q: Why are most motherboards green?

 Like many of the components, motherboards are quite delicate, given all the bits of electronics and tracks that connect the board's various functions, which you can see if you take a closer look. To add a level of protection, motherboards are encased in a thin resin—the solder mask—and these take on a variety of colors, including green. It's both aesthetically pleasing and pretty useful for making the electronics stand out.
