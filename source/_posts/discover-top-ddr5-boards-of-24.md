The 18+2 power stages, rated at 110A per stage, can keep up with the insane power demands of the Ryzen 9 7950X flagship processor and other mainstream Ryzen processors.

 ASUS didn't skimp on cooling, providing robust heatsinks for the VRMs, chipset, and M.2 slots. A custom water-cooling setup can give you even more cooling headroom.

 The rear IO is just as impressive, with eight 10Gbps USB-A ports, two 40Gbps USB4 ports, an additional 20Gbps USB-C port, 2.5G Ethernet, optical audio output, and HDMI 2.1 for integrated RDNA2 graphics on the Ryzen 7000 Series CPUs.

 From taking up less desk space to their aesthetic appeal, Mini-ITX builds are exploding in popularity. The[MSI MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Z790I-Motherboard-Supports-Processors/dp/B0BHCJ6KQ2?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018693&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ddr5-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) motherboard lets you build a mini powerhouse that looks as good as it performs. This motherboard can unleash the power of current GPUs and the fastest DDR5 kits, ensuring smooth gameplay for modern titles, all within a compact form factor.

 If you're leaning towards AMD for your compact build, the[ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-I](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-STRIX-X670E-I-GAMING-WIFI/dp/B0BDTVCJF8?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018693&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ddr5-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative, but it costs more than the MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi while offering the same 105A VRMs and many of the same features. From a budget perspective, the MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi is a much better value than other AMD and Intel mini-ITX offerings.

 Micro-ATX motherboards are like the forgotten middle child, but this motherboard packs enough of a punch to earn its place among the best DDR5 motherboards.

### Q: Can I use DDR4 RAM in a DDR5 motherboard?

 No, DDR5 RAM uses a different pin layout than DDR4, meaning you cannot install a DDR4 RAM module on a DDR5 motherboard.

### Q: Can I use DDR6 RAM in a DDR5 motherboard?

[DDR6 is still in development](https://www.makeuseof.com/ddr6-ram-when-its-coming-what-we-know-so-far/) and hasn't been released, but if the latest DDR5 is any indication, users will need a new motherboard to use DDR6 RAM.
