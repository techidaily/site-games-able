## 1\. Close Steam and Run It as an Administrator

 This may sound too simple, but temporary app glitches can often cause Steam's Big Picture mode to crash or stop working on Windows. Hence, it is a good idea to terminate all Steam processes and reopen the app.

 Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to[open the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) . In the**Processes** tab, right-click on**Steam** and select the**End task** option.

 Right-click on the**Steam** app shortcut and select**Run as administrator** . After that, try to[use the Big Picture mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-steam-big-picture-mode-explained/) again.

## 2\. Modify Steam's EXE File

 Another thing you can do is open Steam directly in Big Picture mode. Several users on the Steam community reported fixing the issue with this trick.

 To open Steam directly in Big Picture mode, right-click on its app shortcut and select**Properties** . In the**Target** field, enter " -tenfoot" to the end of this path, without the quotation marks. Then, hit**Apply** and click**OK** .

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.

## 5\. Update Graphics Drivers

 Another reason why the Big Picture mode may not work or crash while loading is if the graphics drivers on your PC are outdated or buggy. If that’s the case,[updating the graphics drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) should help.

## 6\. Leave Steam Beta

 Are you using the beta version of the Steam client? If so, you may encounter issues with Steam, as beta versions of the app are not always reliable. You should consider switching to the stable version of Steam to steer clear of such issues.

To opt out of the Steam beta:

1. Open the Steam client on your PC.
2. Select**Steam > Settings** .
3. In the**Interface** tab, use the drop-down menu next to**Client Beta Participation** to select**No beta chosen** .
4. Click**Restart Now** to confirm.  
![Leave Steam Beta](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/leave-steam-beta.jpg)

 Wait for Steam to apply the necessary updates and switch to the standard version. After that, you should be able to use the Big Picture mode in Steam.
