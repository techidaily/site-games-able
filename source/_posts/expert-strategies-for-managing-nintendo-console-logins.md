## Expert Strategies for Managing Nintendo Console Logins

 Accessing and managing your various accounts for gaming platforms straight from your consoles is an overlooked but highly convenient feature of modern gaming.

 And with console gaming becoming more linked with subscription services or premium accounts, the convenience of managing your accounts is only becoming more vital. But on your Nintendo Switch, the process is quite tricky. So, if you want to manage your Nintendo account straight from your Nintendo Switch, we can help.

## What You Need to Know Before Removing or Adding a Nintendo Account

 Before you attempt to access and edit your Nintendo account straight from your Switch, however, you need to know a few key issues and points beforehand. This way, you can ensure you don't waste any time on unsupported features or issues you may encounter with your account.

 Specifically, the points you need to know before editing your Nintendo account via your Nintendo Switch console are as follows:

* While you can [add or remove Nintendo users and accounts from your Nintendo Switch](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-another-profile-nintendo-switch/) , the editing options are limited to your Nintendo Switch Online membership, or viewing specific account details.
* Most of the accessible settings for your Nintendo account can be found in the**Nintendo eShop** as opposed to**System Settings** .
* You may be unable to alter some aspects of your Nintendo account, like its region, due to having Nintendo eShop funds. If you were to alter the region settings, you may lose your funds.

 While the account information and options available on your Nintendo Switch may be limited, they still offer useful information or quick and easy ways to deal with subscriptions. But how do you access your Nintendo account options from a Switch?

## How to Manage and Access Your Account Information on Nintendo Switch

 There are two main ways you can manage and access your Nintendo account information on your Switch, either through the**System Settings** of your console or the**Nintendo eShop** . However, the options provided by both methods vary.

### How to Access Your Nintendo Account Information on Your Nintendo Switch

 If you simply want to access your Nintendo account information, you can quickly utilize your Nintendo Switch's**System Settings** . To do so, follow these steps:

* From the Home screen of your Nintendo Switch, select**System Settings** .

* Highlight the options for**User** , and select the user profile linked to your Nintendo account.

* Under**Nintendo Account** , select**Check Account Information** .

* Choose either**View email address** or**View family group members** .

 From here, you can enter your Nintendo account password to view your desired account information. However, if you wish to edit information, other methods may be more useful.

### How to Manage the Payment and Subscription for Your Nintendo Account

 If you want to alter any of the payment or subscription information for your Nintendo account, you will need to use the**Nintendo eShop** settings on your Switch. To do so, follow these steps:

* From the Home screen of your Nintendo Switch, select**Nintendo eShop** .

![A screenshot of the Nintendo Switch Home screen with the option for Nintendo eShop highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023092211225900-57b4628d2267231d57e0fc1078c0596d.jpg)

* Select the user profile linked to your Nintendo account.
* Once the eShop loads, select your profile icon in the top-right of the screen.
* Under**Account Information** , highlight your user profile.

 From the**Account Information** page, you can edit things like payment methods and your Nintendo eShop funds. And, if you highlight the options for**Nintendo Switch Online** , you can even**Renew** or**Terminate Automatic Renewal** to set up or cancel your subscriptions.

## How to Edit Your Nintendo Account Information

 Unfortunately, while you can access and manage some account requirements from your Nintendo Switch, if you want to edit your Nintendo Switch account in more depth, you need to use methods outside your console.

 And, just like [removing someone from your Nintendo Family Group](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-people-nintendo-switch-family-group/) , the primary way you can edit the other aspects of your Nintendo account is via the official Nintendo site. Therefore, to fully edit your Nintendo account details, follow these steps:

* Go to the official account page of the [Nintendo](https://accounts.nintendo.com/login?) website and sign into your account.
* From here, you can select**User Information** to alter your**Profile** ,**Email address** , or**Linked Accounts** by selecting**Change** .

* You can also select**Sign-In and Security Settings** to alter any security options for your account, including your**Password** and**Passkey** , by selecting**Edit** .

![A screenshot of the Sign In and Security Settings for a Nintendo Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sign-in.jpg)

* Under**Privacy and Other Settings** , you can alter any notifications you receive or information you send regarding things like**Emails from Nintendo** or**Usage Information** by selecting**Change** .

![A screenshot of the options for Privacy and Other Settings for a Nintendo Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/privacy.jpg)

* Or, you can select the**Family Group** tab to add or remove Family members.

![A screenshot of the Family Group settings available for a Nintendo Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/family.jpg)

 And with that, you can alter and edit numerous aspects of your Nintendo account. So, if the options on your Nintendo Switch fail you, you at least have a backup method that may not be as convenient but is sure to address your needs.

## Alter Your Nintendo Account With Convenience

 With most of the most urgent options for your Nintendo account supported by your Nintendo Switch, you can view your account details or edit payment and subscription information with ease. This way, you don't have to worry about customer service headaches when looking to cancel something like Nintendo Switch Online.

 But even if the options on your Switch don't support your account alterations, you can still edit all aspects of your account via the official Nintendo site, just at slightly less convenience than doing so on your console.
