## Hush the Controller Shakes on Xbox S

 Rumble features, haptic feedback, and general controller vibration are staple elements of gaming. But you might find persistent vibration features more abrasive than complimentary.

 Luckily, with Xbox Series X|S, you can enable and disable controller vibration for your Xbox Wireless Controllers whenever you see fit. So even if a game requires vibration, and you disable the feature, you can always switch it back on. But how do you universally turn controller vibration on or off for Xbox Series X|S? Let's take a look.

## What You Need to Know Before Turning Off Vibration on Xbox

 Generally, turning off controller vibration for your Xbox controllers is quite simple, but it comes with a few caveats you should be aware of:

* By universally turning off controller vibration, any supported controller could be affected, even if you use a third-party controller. However, because of the variations of third-party controllers, you may not be able to alter and customize it in the same way as an Xbox Wireless Controller.
* As mentioned, some games may rely on controller vibration for gameplay mechanics or even ways of solving puzzles. Because of this, you may need to retroactively alter controller vibration based on the game you are playing.
* Universally turning off controller vibration affects your controller**Profile** . This means that vibration will remain off even if you replace your controller, as your Xbox will automatically utilize the same**Profile** .

 But aside from the practical caveats of altering controller vibration, the most common way you might otherwise be hindered is due to physical issues with a controller. A build-up of dirt, for instance, can cause stick drift or non-responsive vibration motors, and you may need to[take your Xbox controller apart](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-controller-how-to-take-apart/) to fix any vibration problem.
