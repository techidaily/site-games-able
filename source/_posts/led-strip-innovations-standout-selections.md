## FAQ

### Q: Do LED strip lights use a lot of electricity?

 LED strip lights consume a miniscule amount of energy, especially when compared to incandescent bulbs. The LEDs are extremely efficient at converting energy to light rather than heat. Estimates suggest that the average LED strip light consumes as little as 10 to 20 watts per hour.

### Q: How do I connect LED strip lights?

 Most LED strip lights feature easy-to-use connectors. One connector will feature a socket, while the other will feature a prong. Before connecting the two strips, you should attach the socket to the wall while leaving a minimal amount of slack. By connecting the prong to the socket when it is already mounted, you will ensure that your LED strip light is perfectly positioned.

### Q: Is it alright to leave LED strip lights on all night?

 It's okay to leave reputable LED strip lights on all night. LED light strips generally draw little power and produce little heat, as they're produced to run constantly without overheating. Some poorly constructed LED light strips may get hot when allowed to run for long periods of time, in which case turning them off overnight (or replacing them) is ideal.

### Q: Do LED strip lights get hot?

 LED strip lights don't get significantly warmer than the ambient room temperature when allowed to run for long periods of time. LED lights are far more efficient at turning energy into light than incandescent lights. As a result, it's uncommon for LED strip lights to get hotter than 122°F.

### Q: Can I put LED strip lights on wood?

 You can put LED strip lights on wood, but the sticky side of LED light strips doesn't adhere well to wood. You should use a stronger adhesive or light strip mounts to ensure that the light strip doesn't fall down. LEDs generally don't run hot enough to present a serious fire hazard, and if you're concerned, you can use a timer to force the LEDs to occasionally turn off and cool down.
