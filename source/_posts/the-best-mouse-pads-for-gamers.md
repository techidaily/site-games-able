 Ultra-thin and with a micro-textured surface, the Razer Firefly V2 feels like a premium gaming mouse pad. Its optimized surface allows for precision speed and control, with a good balance between glide and friction, and it has an anti-slip rubber base to accommodate intense gameplay.

 In addition to its smooth performance, the Firefly V2 has the style to match. Featuring all-round edge lighting with 19 lighting zones and powered by Razer Chroma RGB, you can experience in-game dynamic lighting effects to heighten your gameplay experience.

 A cable catch feature means you won’t be getting your wired mouse tangled up as you play and can instead tuck the cable away neatly in the top corner. It measures 13.98 inches by 10.04 inches, giving you plenty of room for movement as you skillfully line up your next move.

 Casting their trademark RGB Chroma lighting aside, the Razer Atlas opts for a different tack instead. Fashioned from premium tempered glass, this mouse mat is all about performance. It has been optimized for optical sensors, making good use of its ultra-smooth surface and offering very little by way of resistance.

 Tempered for maximum strength and impact resistance, this gaming mouse pad is surprisingly durable. Its surface remains super smooth and unblemished even after extended gameplay sessions, and you’ll enjoy quieter mouse movement compared to other glass mouse pads.

 For professional gamers, this is the performance mouse pad for you. For non-pros, you’ll still get your money’s worth here if you’re partial to competitive online play. Premium build with a premium price tag, this one’s all about those vital gameplay gains.

 An anti-skid base, a 4mm-thick plush rubber, and a glide-enhanced woven textile surface make for a durable mouse pad that is built to last for years.

## Choosing the Best Mousepad for Gaming

 Choosing the right kind of gaming mouse pad will depend on what type of gamer you are. Do you play professionally or just competitively? Do you favor optical or laser mice? Do you want customizable RGB lighting that syncs with your gameplay, or are you all about smooth tracking and pinpoint accuracy?

 Whatever kind of gamer you are, there's plenty to choose from to accommodate your specific requirements.

 For a premium mouse pad experience, we recommend the Razer Atlas Tempered Glass Mouse Pad. Eschewing all the RGB trimmings, it focuses instead on performance, with an ultra-smooth surface that accommodates precision gameplay and pinpoint accuracy.

 If you're after a more budget-priced alternative, you can't go wrong with the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad. For under $10, you have a reliably smooth gaming mouse pad that can easily be wrapped up and taken anywhere.

 However, provided that you favor optical mice, the Razer Firefly V2 is a great overall option. Optimized for super smooth tracking, thanks to its micro-textured surface, it allows you to move deftly and with improved accuracy. It has a built-in cable catch to prevent any annoying snagging and is armed with Razer Chroma RGB lighting, which can be synced to mirror your gameplay.
