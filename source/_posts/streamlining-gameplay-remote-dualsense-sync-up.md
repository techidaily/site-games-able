## Streamlining Gameplay: Remote DualSense Sync-Up

 In the old days, when Sony released a new controller update, you had to plug your DualSense controller into your PlayStation 5 using a USB-C cable in order to install it. Now you no longer have to leave the comfort of your seat to do it. That's right, you can update your PS5 controller wirelessly, and we're going to show you how to do it.

## 1\. Update Your PS5

 To have the ability to wirelessly update your controller, you need to make sure that your PS5 is running the latest firmware update. So, if you haven't done so lately, make sure to[update your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-ps5/) . Updates are also important because they can also introduce things like new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and security upgrades.

## 2\. Go to the Controller Settings Screen

 Once you update your PS5, and it grabs the latest controller update from Sony's servers, you should be able to update your controller right from the Home Screen when you boot up your console. Once the prompt comes up, all you have to do is select**Update Now** .

 If someone else is using your console, or you weren't paying attention, the**Notify After 24 Hours** option might have been selected. If that is the case, and you want to update your controller right away, you can go to the controller settings to update the controller.

 To do that, press the**PS button** to bring up the Control Center and select**Accessories** .

 In the popup, select the DualSense controller you want to update, and then select**Controller Settings** in the menu that appears on the left.

## 3\. Start the Wireless Update

 In Controller Settings, navigate to the**DualSense Wireless Controller Device Software** option and make sure it says**Update available** on the right. If it does, select it.

![PS5 controller settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/ps5-controller-settings.jpg)

 To trigger the wireless update, just select**Update** . Since this is not a full system software update, the process will only take a few seconds to complete. If you find that the**Update** option is grayed out, connect your PS5 controller to the console with a USB-C cable and update it the old way. The next time, your controller will be able to update wirelessly.

 We recommend you install PS5 controller updates the moment they're available or when you experience issues with your DualSense (it's actually one of the ways to[fix PS5 controller drift](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-drifting-ps5-dualsense-controller/) ).
