### Key Takeaways

As Razer's debut into the hot-swappable mechanical keyboard scene, the BlackWidow V4 75% aims to appeal to enthusiasts and beginners alike.

 When combined with Razer's other products, like their mice and headsets, as well as their supported Synapse RGB accessories and lights, you can achieve one of the most customizable and immersive gaming experiences.

 Despite some exclusions to its design and the potential to nullify its warranty if you plan on taking full advantage of all of its optional upgrades; the BlackWidow V4 75% looks to be a premium option that could be worth the asking price, especially if you're already invested in Team Green.

## Design and Features

 Out of the box, the BlackWidow V4 75% looks like a smaller twin version of their full-sized BlackWidow V4 Pro. But it is what's inside this condensed design that makes it one of the best keyboards released by Razer to date. For $190 you can get its classic black design, or for another $10, it's all white.

### Compact, but not Compromising

 The keyboard boasts a compact design, ideal for users with limited desk space. But, despite its smaller size, the BlackWidow V4 75% hasn't lost many capabilities, having a complete function row, well-placed arrow keys, and a multi-function roller and media buttons.

 The Razer BlackWidow V4 75% keyboard features a media roller located in the upper right corner as well as two dedicated media buttons. That said, I would have liked to see the roller include a press-to-mute function to free up the second media key for different quick access options.

 Another noticeable absence is the lack of a pass-through USB port, with only one USB-C port to connect to your PC.

 The included USB-A to USB-C cord is well-constructed. Not being permanently attached, it's great for those who have transitioned to USB-C devices or prefer coiled cables. Interestingly though, the connector rather fat, making it incompatible with Razer's other devices, including some of their mice.

 Made of pleather, the magnetic wrist rest is plush, comfortable, and stays cool, even with extended use.

 With it sloped against the keyboard's bottom edge, I found that it stayed in place securely, including during more heated Overwatch 2 matches.

### Return of the Orange

 The keyboard features a socketed PCB preloaded with the brand's Gen-3 Razer™ Orange Tactile Mechanical Switches, offering a tactile and quiet typing experience without compromising on performance. This is perfect for users who want precision without the constant click-clack noise.

 Paul Antill / MakeUseOf

 Sure, they can be fun to type and game on, but unless you and everyone around you plan on using a good set of headphones, it can get annoying rather quickly. These factory-lubricated switches were a fan favorite for years but were eventually discontinued, to much dismay. The previous switches used monochrome LED, while the new design features Chroma RGB with full-color backlighting support thanks to its transparent casing.

 Paul Antill / MakeUseOf

 Compared to Razer's other switch options—Razer Green and Yellow switches—Orange tactile switches are known for their satisfying bump, offering a pleasant typing experience while maintaining a more subdued sound. For many, this made it the best of both worlds, with an excellent feel without an overwhelming clicky sound.

 Paul Antill / MakeUseOf

 The Green switches provide a loud click with a noticeable bump, with an actuation point of 1.9mm and an actuation force of 50g. In comparison, the Yellow switches—my personal favorite—deliver a smooth and quiet keystroke with an actuation point of just 1.2mm and an actuation force of 45g.

### Keycaps

 The keycaps themselves are made of doubleshot ABS, which may be a bit disappointing for those who prefer sturdier PBT material. Razer has seemingly taken the disadvantages of ABS keycaps into account, however, improving their design with a textured feel that's intended to resist wear and reduce exposure to oils from the user's hands, which contribute to unwanted shininess and degradation over time.

 While the provided switches are three-pin, the BlackWidow's PCB is a five-socket design, accommodating Razer's own switches as well as third-party options, which is a welcome addition. Customizers can also get right to work, with the keycap and switch puller included in its box.

### Backplate

 Interestingly, that's not to say that all customization is encouraged by Razer. Even though the design allows for users to swap out the BlackWidow V4's plate-mounted stabilizers for the screw-in variety, doing so will automatically void your warranty.

![Razer Blackwidow 75% - Back](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-back.jpg)

 Paul Antill / MakeUseOf

 Fair warning to those who may think that Razer's full customization support is unwavering—it's not. On one hand, this is great for users who want the ultimate control over personalization, though that instant sacrifice may have you reconsider the tradeoff.

Razer

 In addition to its switch customizability, the BlackWidow V4 75% internal construction has taken even more cues from popular modification designs. These include a gasket-mounted FR4 plate for a "poppier" sound, two layers of sound-dampening foam to prevent unwanted reverb from the aluminum body, and a PCB fire-retardent "tape-mod" that comes pre-installed from the factory. For those unfamiliar with the practice, for years, enthusiasts have taken it upon themselves to use painter's or duct tape to help deaden the reverberation sound from within the deck. While this step is like a rite of passage for every new keyboard, eliminating the need to open it up for this seemingly simple mod makes you feel like Razer understands its community and users' wants.

### Lighting

 Together we have 18 lighting zones that are fully customizable with Razer Synapse with reactive effect support for 200+ games. The side strips provide additional illumination while its all-transparent switch housing ensures maximum RGB shine-through without unnecessary or distracting bleed.

 It boasts per-key lighting and under glow for an immersive lighting experience that looks incredible whether you're using one of its presets or diving deep into the software to customize fully.

 With Overwatch 2, for example, the keyboard will change color to match the skin of your character, while the WASD keys stand out with their distinct color. Similarly, your ultimate and ability cooldowns change color or flash when they are ready to use.

 It's one of those integrations that, until you've tried it, sounds like a gimmick, but once you have, can hook you into that ecosystem. When paired with their Basilisk V3 Pro, which we are also reviewing, the synced effects are even cooler. Taking things even further, we added the Synapse-compatible [Yeelight Cubes](https://www.makeuseof.com/yeelight-cube-review/) for an even more immersive lighting experience that filled our gaming room.

## 75% the Size, 100% Worth It

 Despite Razer's decision to use less durable ABS caps, lack of pass-through, and its questionable decision to void the warranty if you want to take full advantage of its modification options, the BlackWidow V4 75% delivers a big punch in its debut. If you've already invested in the Razer ecosystem, or you're willing to pay the Razer tax, the BlackWidow V4 75% is one of the best compact mechanical keyboards that will impress long-time keyboard customizers and those looking to get into the hot-swap lifestyle for the first time.
