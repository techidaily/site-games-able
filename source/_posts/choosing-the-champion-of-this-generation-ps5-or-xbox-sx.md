 The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X headline the ninth generation of video game consoles. Both have a lot to offer, but which is right for you? Let's compare the PS5 and Xbox Series X in several key areas to help you decide.

## Models and Pricing

 The Xbox Series X and standard model of the PlayStation 5 both cost $500\. The original PlayStation 5 was also offered in a Digital Edition for $400, with the only difference being the lack of a disc drive (and a slightly smaller size accordingly). Now,[the PS5 Slim is the current offering](https://www.makeuseof.com/old-ps5-vs-the-new-slimmer-ps5-what-are-the-differences/) . Its digital-only edition costs $450, with a detachable disc drive sold separately for $80 if you change your mind.

 If you want an Xbox but can't pay upfront, Microsoft offers the [Xbox All Access program](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-all-access) . This allows you to pay $37 per month for an Xbox Series X, plus a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate, over 24 months.

 Note that Microsoft also offers the Xbox Series S, a smaller and less powerful console that lacks a disc drive. Since that system is in a different class, we won't consider it here. See our [comparison of the Xbox Series X and Series S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-should-you-buy/) if you'd like more info on it.

 While both consoles were notoriously difficult to find for years after their release, you can now find either one readily available in stores and online.

**Winner:** Tie. The core price is the same and both offer an alternative option.

## System Specs

 The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful machines. They support 4K gaming and can run games at 60FPS, with some running at 120FPS.

 The consoles each include an SSD for faster loading than prior generations, though the sizes differ depending on the model. The original PS5 has a custom 825GB SSD (667GB usable), with the PS5 Slim upping this to a 1TB drive (842GB usable). Meanwhile, the Series X has a 1TB SSD (802GB usable).

 On paper, the Xbox Series X is slightly more powerful. However, in practice, both systems are about equal in performance. If you're interested in a detailed breakdown, see our [comparison of the Xbox Series X and PS5's speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-which-console-is-faster/) . Features like [Quick Resume on Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-xbox-series-x-quick-resume/) , which let you resume multiple games from where you left off, might make the difference for you.

**Winner:** Tie, as there's not enough real-world difference to make a call.

## Console Design

 The PS5 and Series X differ greatly in design.[The PS5 is a giant console](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-big-is-the-ps5/) , standing tall next to any other system even with its Slim revision. It features a curved design, which might make it difficult to fit into your entertainment center.

 The Xbox Series X, on the other hand, has a square length and width, making it feel more like a desktop PC. It's not as large as the PS5, so if you're cramped for space, that console will fit your setup better.

 The PS5 has one USB-C port on the original models and two on the Slim models, while the Series X lacks these. Otherwise, this part mostly comes down to your preference, as both consoles work in either a vertical or horizontal position.

**Winner:** Xbox Series X, due to its more compact size—though the PS5 has a more interesting design.

## New Controllers and Old Controller Support

 Sony and Microsoft took different approaches with their console controllers this time around. The Xbox Series X controller is nearly identical to the Xbox One's controller. The only differences are a reshaped D-pad, a dedicated Share button, and additional texture for grip.

 The Xbox Series X controller still uses AA batteries, which you might see as a pro or a con. You can buy the [Xbox Rechargeable Battery kit](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Rechargeable-Battery-USB-C%C2%AE-Cable-one/dp/B08DFB4889?linkCode=ll1&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=25a8c19598f6cd2730f7f6a87b2c534f&language=en%5FUS&ref%5F=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU96782&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fps5-vs-xbox-series-x%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) if you don't want to worry about changing batteries all the time, but this is an additional expense. As a perk, all [Xbox One controllers are fully compatible with Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-xbox-one-controllers-on-your-xbox-series-x/) (and vice-versa).

 On the other hand, the DualSense controller for the PS5 looks fairly different than the PS4's DualShock 4\. The adaptive triggers are the biggest standout—the L2 and R2 buttons can dynamically adjust their resistance so you "feel" what you're doing in the game, such as the trigger becoming tighter when driving a car through mud.

![A Dualsense controller on top of the PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/53398097586_69a53fb828_o.jpg)

 The DualSense also includes a mic in the controller, allowing you to communicate without a headset. And haptic feedback allows for more detailed vibrations than older controllers.[There's a lot to love about the DualSense](https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-dualsense-controller-reasons-love-hate/) , but it's not perfect (battery life is mediocre, and stick drift is an issue).

 Otherwise, it still has the familiar PS button layout, including the touchpad seen on the PS4's DualShock 4\. Like that controller, the DualSense is rechargeable (this time with a USB-C port). You can use the DualShock 4 on PS5 when playing PS4 titles, but PS5 games require a DualSense.

**Winner:** PS5\. Worrying about AA batteries is a pain, and the DualSense has a few new exciting features. The Xbox controller is still rock-solid, though.

## Game Libraries

 Of course, no console is worth buying without good games, which is why available titles are likely the biggest factor in your decision. The PS5 and Xbox Series X each have several facets to consider in this sphere, so let's break them down one by one.

<a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379" border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Exclusive Titles

 The PlayStation 5 hasn't received a ton of true exclusives since launch, as many of its major titles are also available on PS4 (and PC, in many cases). The biggest PS5 exclusives so far include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the Demon's Souls remake, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Stellar Blade. Previously exclusive titles like Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Returnal are now available on PC, though they are still console-exclusive since they aren't on Xbox.

 Some games are available on both PS4 and PS5, but not other consoles. These include Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Horizon Forbidden West, and God of War Ragnarok.

 At the time of writing, the Xbox Series X has few exclusive games. Starfield is one of the biggest, though it's also on PC. Redfall is another title that's also on PC but not PS5, though it received poor reviews. In 2024, Microsoft even started taking the opposite approach, with previous Xbox console exclusives Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush being announced for PS5 (these are available on Xbox One as well).

 Almost all of Microsoft's big games are released on both Series X and PC. Meanwhile, the company announced in mid-2023 that Xbox One game development has ceased.

**Winner:** PS5.

### Backward Compatibility

[The PS5 is backward-compatible](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-ps5-backward-compatible/) with nearly all PS4 titles. If you have a PS5 with a disc drive, you can insert your PS4 discs to play those games. On any PS5 model, you can access your entire digital library of PS4 games and download them on your PS5.

 However, the [Xbox Series X's ability to play older games](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-old-xbox-games-on-xbox-series-x/) goes much further. While it's compatible with almost all Xbox One titles, it can also play over 500 Xbox 360 titles and a few dozen original Xbox titles. That means you can enjoy many disc-based games you already own, plus catch up on Xbox classics from previous generations.

 On both systems, older games will run better thanks to the more powerful hardware. The exact features available depend on the game; Microsoft touts FPS Boost to run older titles at smoother frame rates.

**Winner:** Xbox Series X, due to the sheer volume of older Xbox games you can enjoy on the console.

### Game Subscription Services

 Xbox's killer feature is Game Pass, a subscription service that provides unlimited access to hundreds of high-quality games for $11 per month. It's available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, as well as a separate plan for PC. If you want Game Pass on both Xbox and PC, plus multiplayer access on Xbox, you can pay $17/month for Game Pass Ultimate.

 Game Pass is one of the strongest reasons to consider an Xbox Series X, especially with [AAA game prices going up to $70](https://www.makeuseof.com/expensive-video-games-the-new-normal/) apiece in some cases. Game Pass lets you enjoy big-name games and indie titles alike at an affordable cost, even without waiting for a sale. It's one of the best deals in gaming, especially since all Microsoft-published games are available on the day they release.

 On the PlayStation 5 side, Sony updated its PlayStation Plus service in mid-2022 to offer a similar setup. The higher tiers (Extra and Premium) replace the old PlayStation Now streaming plan. However, this has some weaknesses compared to Game Pass; in particular, there's more filler and major PlayStation exclusives don't all appear in the catalog.

 Check our [comparison of Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-now-vs-xbox-game-pass/) for a full breakdown.

**Winner:** Xbox Series X. Game Pass is hard to beat.

### Virtual Reality

 If you're into virtual reality, the PlayStation 5 is the console for you. The PlayStation VR (originally made for the PS4) works with PS5, and [the PlayStation VR2 (our review)](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-vr2-review/) is exclusive to PS5.

 Microsoft has no plans to introduce VR for Xbox, so don't expect any VR support on Series X.

**Winner:** PS5.

## Platform Ecosystems

 As we've seen, both the PS5 and Xbox Series X have a lot going for them. However, there's another important element that you must decide for yourself: which console ecosystem makes more sense for you.

 Backward compatibility is a lot more appealing when you already have a library of games built up. But don't forget about other aspects, like moving your saved data, keeping your trophies/achievements, being able to party up with your friends, enjoying your existing subscriptions, the controllers you already have, and similar.

 So if you've been an Xbox player for years, even if you're tempted by the PS5, it might make more sense to stay with Xbox. That way, you don't have to start over with all the above aspects, and the true cost of upgrading is lower.

**Winner:** Tie, as this depends on your situation.

## Should You Buy the PS5 or Xbox Series X?

 There's no clear answer on whether the PS5 or Xbox Series X is the better console. Counting each section winner above results in a tie score, and neither console has a strong enough weakness to make it the inferior choice.

As a result, we recommend the following:

* **Buy the PlayStation 5 if:** You want to play PS5 exclusives, aren't tempted by Game Pass, don't have a library of older Xbox games, or are interested in VR.
* **Buy the Xbox Series X if:** You want to use Game Pass, aren't interested in the PS5's exclusives, or are deeply integrated into the Xbox ecosystem.

 If you don't think either console is right for you at the moment, don't forget about the excellent Nintendo Switch, either.
