## Unlock Hidden Metrics: Total Gameplay Hours on Xbox Series S

 Perfecting your favorite games can take up vast amounts of time and effort. And with some titles encouraging hundreds upon hundreds of hours of endless gameplay loops, your time spent playing can often drift past you completely unnoticed.

 But with some of the supported gaming stats available on Xbox Series X|S, you can check how long you've played your games for on the platform. The feature, however, is not without its faults. So, if you want to check in on how much time you've sunk into an Xbox game or if you're having trouble doing so, we can help.

## What You Need to Know About the Time Played Stat on Xbox

 Unfortunately, before you check your play-time for an Xbox game, you might want to be aware of some key aspects of the feature. And how, despite the**Time played** statistic being a staple feature of Xbox Series X|S game settings, this specific stat can be inconsistent.

 Notably, then, the key things you need to be aware of before looking into the**Time played** statistic for a game of your choice are as follows:

* For most games, the**Time played** stat is consistent, but for some games,**Time played** will display an outdated or incorrectly tracked amount of time.
* Backwards compatible Xbox games you have used with the same Xbox account on past Xbox consoles will only track your time played for time spent on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, not Xbox 360.
* While the**Time played** stat is always available through your Xbox's settings, not every game tracks this stat. If a game doesn't record how long you have played, the stat will simply read**0d 0h 0m** .

 So, while the ability to[compare Xbox stats with friends on Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-compare-gaming-stats-with-friends/) is mostly accurate, the**Time played** stat is strangely plagued with issues. However, for mainline and current game releases, the time you spend playing will be tracked accurately, unless developers have specifically disabled the feature.

## How to Check Your Time Played From Your Xbox Series X|S

 Now you know some of the caveats of the feature, you can go ahead and start checking your**Time played** stat for any game you've played with your Xbox account without any confusing surprises.

 So, to start checking your**Time played** stat for any game associated with your account on Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the options for**Game activity** , and select**All achievements** .

* Select the game you want to see the**Time played** stat for.

* Under**Progress** , highlight**Stats** .

 From the**Stats** screen, your**Time played** is displayed as the first metric. And, if you want to compare your**Time played** for the selected game against your friends, you can select**Time played** for a full comparison leaderboard.

 However, this method is not without fault, and sometimes the**Stats** menu for games is inaccurate or unsupported. Luckily, there are still some methods that can help to define how much you've played a game beyond**Stats** .

## What You Can Do if Your Xbox Doesn’t Show Your Time Played Stats

 If you have run into a problem with checking how long you've played a game on Xbox Series X|S, there are still a couple of ways you might be able to recover the stat outside of Xbox settings.

 Most commonly, if your Xbox refuses to provide an accurate**Time played** figure, it's always worth double-checking if your game tracks how long you have played separately to your Xbox Series X|S.

 In this scenario, you can generally find how long you have played your game in a separate in-game statistics screen or even alongside your save files when you attempt to load into the game. However, while common, not every game you play supports independent statistics.

 Alternatively, the Xbox app for Windows and PC can help to reveal an accurate**Time played** stat for your Xbox games. By using the**Achievements** tab and selecting a game, you can access the**Time played** stat outside your Xbox Series X|S. You can install the Xbox app through the official[Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) site.

 But while using the Xbox app or in-game stats is a useful backup option, neither method completely fixes the**Time played** stat. Even[setting up parental settings on Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-parental-controls-how-to/) to provide screen time statistics isn't comparable to**Time played** .

## Time Played on Xbox Series X|S Is a Useful Yet Inconsistent Feature

 On paper, being able to intuitively check how long you've spent on every game you've played with your Xbox account straight from your Series X|S is a great and convenient feature. Unfortunately, the inaccuracies and issues with the statistic, whether through tracking inconsistencies or incompatibility can ruin it.

 That said, even with some of the downsides of tracking how long you have played your Xbox games, other options can make the process easier, even if your Xbox Series X|S should've done that in the first place.
