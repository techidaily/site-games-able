 Building an absolutely epic Minecraft city with your friends on split-screen multiplayer could easily take upwards of one hundred hours or more in some cases. The last thing you want is to accidentally delete that Minecraft world and erase all the hard work that went into creating it.

 Backing up anything of importance is always a great idea, so why not add your Minecraft server to that list?[Backing up and restoring deleted Minecraft worlds](https://www.makeuseof.com/minecraft-world-how-to-restore/) can be done on many different devices, but it's much easier to back your world up in the first place than struggle to restore it later. Always make sure you make a copy of your world regularly to prevent any tragic mishaps.
