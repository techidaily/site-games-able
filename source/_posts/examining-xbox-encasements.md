## Examining Xbox Encasements

 Being able to customize your gaming accessories can be a massive aspect of how you choose to play on your favorite platform. And with custom shells for consoles and controllers, you can fine-tune your gaming tech to your preference.

 But aside from limited edition consoles, owning a uniquely customized Xbox Series X is quite tricky. Yet with Xbox Series X Console Wraps, you can purchase officially licensed console shells that provide an element of customization for your Series X. But what are Xbox Console Wraps, and how do they work? Let's find out.

## What Are Xbox's Official Xbox Series X Console Skins?

 Officially licensed by Microsoft and Xbox, Xbox Console Wraps allows you to represent your favorite games and customize your Xbox Series X without spending too much money on a time-exclusive limited edition console.

 Through Xbox Console Wraps, Xbox can make official designs related to Xbox titles available for you to purchase as a shell wrap for your Xbox Series X console. For Xbox Game Studios releases, like Bethesda's Starfield, instead of releasing an overpriced exclusive console, you can buy an official Starfield Xbox Console Wrap for your current Series X.

 At the same time, some of the official designs used when [creating an Xbox controller through Design Labs](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-xbox-design-lab-to-create-a-custom-xbox-controller/) are also available as an Xbox Console Wrap. This means that classic Xbox designs, like the Arctic Camo Xbox Wireless Controller design, are available for your Series X as a shell for your console.

 But while Xbox Console Wraps provide much-needed and affordable customization for your Series X, console shells can be quite risky when it comes to the safety of your Series X. Luckily, Xbox has some key pieces of info addressing this.

## The Key Things You Need to Know About Xbox Console Wraps

 With console safety being a prime concern, especially regarding heat flow, you may have a few lingering questions about Xbox Console Wraps. Or, you might just be wondering how secure each Console Wrap is.

 Fortunately, Xbox has addressed safety issues to reinforce the practicality of Xbox Console Wraps and provided specific information regarding the ventilation of your Series X. From this, the key points associated with Xbox Console Wraps safety are as follows:

* Xbox has specifically designed Xbox Console Wraps for a custom and precise fit. And with the performance of your Series X placed as a core concern, Xbox says that ventilation is unimpeded.
* To further ensure ventilation, each Xbox Console Wrap has small feet fitted to its base, allowing for uninterrupted airflow at the base of your Series X.
* In terms of sturdiness, according to Xbox, every Console Wrap is made from high-tech fabric and features silicon panels on the interior of each Wrap.
* Finally, each Xbox Console Wrap uses a hook and loop mechanism that secures the Console Wrap and ensures it remains affixed to your console.

 While console ventilation is a valid concern if you're looking to add a shell to your console, Xbox Console Wraps are tailor-made by Xbox itself to prevent any issues. But while your safety concerns may be satisfied, the pricing and the release dates of all the available Console Wraps may be as important.

## The Kind of Xbox Series X Console Wraps Available

 Beyond your safety concerns or the overview of what Xbox Console Wraps are, you're probably wondering what kinds of Xbox Console Wraps are available, when they're available, and how much each design will cost you.

 As of the official announcement of Xbox Console Wraps, there are three different kinds of designs available. However, the pricing and release date of each Console Wrap is unique to its design. To be specific, the there available Xbox Console Wraps are as follows:

* An official Starfield-inspired Xbox Console Wrap available in the US, Canada and Europe from October 18th 2023 for $49.99.
* An Artic Camo Console Wrap based on the Xbox Wireless Controller design available from November 10th 2023 in the US, Canada and Europe for $44.99.
* And, similarly, a Mineral Camo Console Wrap, also based on an Xbox Wireless Controller design, is available for $44.99 from November 10th in the US, Canada and Europe.

 While three designs at launch may seem limited, the implication of Xbox first-party games utilized as console skins suggests that some of [the best Xbox Series X|S exclusives](https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-xbox-exclusives-to-test-out-your-xbox-series-xs/) could also become Xbox Console Wraps. But for every available Xbox Console Wrap, you can visit the official posting via the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/Xbox-Series-X-Console-Wraps/8x08lwws1qh7/NLZ4) .

## Make Your Xbox Series X Your Own With Xbox Console Wraps

 With Xbox Console Wraps, you can customize more than just Xbox accessories without spending huge amounts of money on exclusive consoles. And with Xbox Console Wraps being supported by first-party Xbox games, you can turn your Xbox Series X into a mascot of your own.

 However, Xbox Console Wraps has a long way to go if it wants to catch up with Xbox Design Labs and the complete customization available for Xbox controllers. But still, having a secure, safe and tailor-made customization option for your Xbox Series X is a great way to personalize your Xbox experience.
