## What Platforms Can You Get Baldur's Gate 3 On, and How Much Is It?

![Baldur's Gate 3 Steam Store Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-steam-store-page.jpeg)

 Baldur’s Gate 3 came out for PC on August 3rd, but it will come out for macOS and PS5 on September 6th, and perhaps next year for Xbox Series X|S. Larian Studios has issues getting the split-screen to work effectively on the [cheaper and less powerful Xbox Series S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-should-you-buy/) .

 You can get Baldur’s Gate 3 on PC and Mac from Steam, GOG, and GeForce Now. It costs $59.99 alone or $69.98 with the Digital Deluxe Edition DLC.

 This is the only DLC for the game right now, and it features in-game cosmetics inspired by Divinity: Original Original Sin II, as well as a digital art book, printable character sheets, and a digital original soundtrack.

 There are mods for Baldur’s Gate 3, but we suggest you wait a little longer to try them out since most were made with early access in mind.

## Does Baldur's Gate 3 Have a Multiplayer, and How Does It Work?

 Baldur’s Gate 3 has a single-player mode you can play by yourself. However, you can quickly change your single-player game into a multiplayer game where your friends can join and control characters in your game.

 But if you want a game where all the players have their own custom characters, you’ll need to press the**Multiplayer** button in Baldur’s Gate 3’s main menu. From there, you can host your party or join an existing party.

 You can load saves across different platforms, but there’s no cross-play for PS5 and PC. Meaning that you can’t play with a friend using a PS5 if you’re using a PC and vice-versa.

 And yes, you can play split-screen simply by activating another controller in-game.

 You should run your split-screen game with DirectX instead of Vulkan because it could crash otherwise.

## Is Baldur's Gate 3 Okay for Kids?

 If you were thinking of gifting this to an underage child, don’t. The game has very mature themes and contains nudity and sexual content. It’s a game for adults and not something you should give a child or even play around where a child could see. The game is rated 18 for violence, language, and sex.

 There is a toggle to hide nudity in the character creation stage. This might help reduce the chances of a child seeing something inappropriate while you play.
