 An older Nvidia graphics card update is causing micro stuttering on gaming PCs with Nvidia GPUs. Micro stuttering is when your visuals look jumpy or jittery despite your FPS counter claiming everything is running smoothly. These skips are most noticeable when playing games or browsing online, especially if VSync is enabled.

 The issue currently relates specifically to Nvidia GPUs, and Nvidia is aware of it. So, if you've noticed micro stuttering after a recent Nvidia GPU driver update, the Nvidia version 551.46 driver should fix things again. If it doesn't, you may instead need to perform a more in-depth fix. Check out [how to fix game stuttering on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-game-stutter-fix/) for more information.

 As said, Nvidia is aware of the micro stuttering issue affecting its GPUs. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia driver version 551.46 (the driver fix for this issue) isn't available via the typical methods to [update your Nvidia graphics card drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) . Right now, the patch is in a beta state, so you need to download and install it manually.

 To grab the newest Nvidia driver, head to the [Nvidia version 551.46 driver download page](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/5519?=&linkId=100000240085402) and grab it from there. However, because it's a beta driver, there's an extra caveat:

> To be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is. They are run through a much abbreviated QA process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly. The safest option is to wait for the next WHQL certified driver.

 As such, before you install this driver, it's best to learn about [how to roll back your graphics drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) in case the beta driver ends up causing more issues than it fixes. However, most users have reported that the new Nvidia driver fixes the micro stuttering issue.

 Once downloaded, double-click the file and follow the onscreen instructions, and your micro stuttering issue should be resolved. Hopefully, this driver will help get your games and videos running smoothly again without any annoying micro stuttering.
