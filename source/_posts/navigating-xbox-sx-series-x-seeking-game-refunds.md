## Navigating Xbox S/X Series X: Seeking Game Refunds

 There are many incredible games on the Xbox Series X|S, but for every hit, there are bound to be some misses. So what happens if you accidentally order the wrong game package or you’re just not happy with your purchase? If that happens with a physical product, you would usually take it back to the store and get your money back if you’re eligible.

 Thankfully, you can do this with your digital purchases on the Xbox Series X|S as well. If you want to request a refund but you’re not sure where or how to, we will walk you through the process below.

## Do I Qualify for a Refund on the Xbox Series X|S?

 If you're a fan of gaming, you will be well versed in how expensive it is and are likely always looking for[ways to save money with your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-ways-to-save-money/) . And refunding purchases that you aren't satisfied with is certainly one of them.

 While it is possible to return a digital game or product on the Xbox Series X|S, there are some limitations. The two main factors that can affect the success of your refund request are as follows:

1\. You must request your refund within 14 days of the purchase date.

 2\. You can’t have played the game in question for a significant amount of time.

 The definition of what exactly a ‘significant amount of time’ is isn’t explained on[Microsoft’s website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) , but it likely depends on the game. For example, if you’re returning a five-hour-long game and you’ve played it for two hours, that’s almost 50% of the game that you’ve experienced. But if the game in question is 50 hours long and you’ve played it for two hours, you’ve only experienced a fraction of it.

## How to Request a Refund for a Digital Game on the Xbox Series X|S

 Requesting a refund for a digital game on your Xbox Series X|S is thankfully very simple and is very similar to[refunding purchases on the PS4 or the PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-game-ps4-ps5/) . You can't do so from the comfort of your console, however. You will have to head to[Microsoft’s website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) to get started

1. Head to[support.xbox.com](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) or just click the link to be taken straight there.
2. You will then need to log into the Microsoft account that you used to purchase the game in question. You can log in by pressing**Sign in** at the bottom of the page or in the top right corner.
3. Once you’ve logged in, scroll down to the**Request availability** section. If there is a valid game there, click the box beside the title and press**Request a refund** to bring up the request form.

4. Start filling out your form, beginning with the**Reason for request** . The options available are:

* **Accidental purchase** .
* **Billing error** .
* **Purchased content doesn’t work** .
* **I didn’t make the purchase** .
* **Cancel a preorder** .

 5\. Next up is the**Additional details** box. Filling out this box is optional, but it’s a good place to put any notes, such as if the game you purchased had any bugs.

![Request a Refund Form Page Microsoft](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/request-a-refund-form-page-microsoft.jpg)

 6\. Enter the email address of the Microsoft account you used to make the purchase.

 7\. Press**Next** .

 8\. Review your form to make sure all the details are accurate. Once you’re satisfied, press**Submit** .

![Review Details of Request a Refund Form Page Microsoft](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/review-details-of-request-a-refund-form-page-microsoft.jpg)

 Your refund request will then be sent away for review, and you should expect an answer within 72 hours.

### What Happens if the Game I Want to Refund Isn’t Listed?

 There are several reasons why the game you want to refund isn’t listed on the returns page. If you would like more information on what items will or won't be available there, click**Why don't I see my purchase on the list?** It is worth noting that subscriptions and preorders don’t show up in that section, so that could be a contributing factor.

 In most cases, if the game in question doesn’t show up on the returns page, it is non-refundable for one reason or another. In that case, it might pay to go back and review the details of your purchase and make sure you are eligible for a refund.

## What Happens Once My Refund Request Is Accepted?

 If your refund request is successful, you can expect to see an email from Microsoft confirming this, and you will be able to see your refund being processed in your Microsoft account. You will also have your access to the game revoked, so it will no longer be playable.
