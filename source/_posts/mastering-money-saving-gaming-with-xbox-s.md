## 1\. Shop for Games That Are on Sale

 Taking advantage of sales is a tip that will help you in every aspect of life, not just in terms of gaming. Every little bit counts, so even picking up a $1.00 loaf of bread rather than the $3.00 one at the supermarket will help you save money. But thankfully, choosing games that are on sale usually saves you more than just a couple of dollars here and there.

 Picking games that are on sale not only saves you money but also forces you to think outside the box. Maybe none of the games you were initially thinking of purchasing are on sale. Instead of that being a bad thing, look at it as an opportunity. Now you can branch out and try a completely new experience. Who knows? You might even find some hidden gems or your next favorite game using this method.

## 2\. Purchase Games With a Lot of Replayability

 The best part about gaming is the overwhelming variety of options that are out there. You can pick up a game that will only take you five hours to complete, or you can pick one up for the same price that you can keep playing for the rest of your life.

 When you’re looking at saving money, the best choice out of those two options is obvious. Replayability is a great way to save money when it comes to video games because you can go longer without having to buy another one.

![A photograph of an Xbox Wireless Controller in front of a gaming monitor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/replacement-feature.jpg)

 Games that have online multiplayer functionality, like Call of Duty, for example, are great for replayability. If you’re not a fan of first-person shooters or competitive games, life or farming sims such as Stardew Valley can provide you with hundreds or even thousands of hours of playtime.

## 3\. Download and Play Free Games

 Buying games on sale that are cheaper than they otherwise would have been is great. But there are hordes of games out there that won't even cost you a single penny. Free games usually come with a catch in the form of gatcha game mechanics or in-game purchases to entice people into spending money.

 But there are many games where these in-game purchases are purely cosmetic and completely optional, meaning you can play for as long as you want without reaching for your wallet at all. Games like Overwatch 2, Fortnite, or Apex Legends are just a few examples of fun and rewarding games that you can play completely free of charge.

## 4\. Subscribe to Xbox Game Pass

 If you’re a gamer on a budget, Xbox Game Pass will be your best friend. Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that does cost money, but the number of games you get access to makes it incredibly good value.

## 5\. Collect and Use Microsoft Reward Points

 Microsoft Reward Points is a loyalty program that rewards you with points for simply using your Xbox console. There are tons of[ways to collect Microsoft Reward Points while playing your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-earn-microsoft-reward-points-xbox-series-x-s/) . You can collect them by getting achievements, playing certain games, and buying things from the Xbox store.

 Xbox Game Pass Perks can include anything from loot boxes for certain games or even free monthly subscriptions to services like Crunchyroll or Discord Nitro. These offers are all available for a limited time and change often, so make sure you check them out regularly.

 You can check your Game Pass Perks from the Xbox website, your console itself, or on the Xbox Game Pass mobile app by opening it and heading to your profile. If you have Xbox Game Pass but don’t see any Perks there, keep in mind that they are only available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.

## 7\. Use Energy Saving Mode on Your Xbox

 Saving money on your Xbox doesn’t just come from buying cheaper games or utilizing reward points and perks. You can also use your Xbox to save money on your power bill by using the more eco-and-wallet-friendly energy-saving mode.

 The main[difference between shutdown and sleep mode on the Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-shutdown-vs-sleep-mode/) is that sleep effectively only turns your console half-off when you're not using it. This is great for convenience as it will boot up faster the next time you turn it on, but the amount of time it really saves you is negligible.

![Xbox Shutdown energy saving mode explaination](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/xbox-shutdown-energy-saving-mode-explaination.jpg)

 Image Credit:[Xbox](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/01/11/xbox-carbon-aware-console-sustainability/)

 Putting your Xbox on shutdown (energy saving) mode is by far the most energy-efficient way to operate your system and uses 20% less power than sleep mode. 20% less power is a significant amount and is just one of the many ways you can reduce your power bill at the end of the month.
