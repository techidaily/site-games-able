![The MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi motherboard on a gray background.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/msi-mpg-z790i-edge-wifi.jpg)

_MSI_

 From taking up less desk space to their aesthetic appeal, Mini-ITX builds are exploding in popularity. The [MSI MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Z790I-Motherboard-Supports-Processors/dp/B0BHCJ6KQ2?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018693&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ddr5-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) motherboard lets you build a mini powerhouse that looks as good as it performs. This motherboard can unleash the power of current GPUs and the fastest DDR5 kits, ensuring smooth gameplay for modern titles, all within a compact form factor.

 If you're leaning towards AMD for your compact build, the [ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-I](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-STRIX-X670E-I-GAMING-WIFI/dp/B0BDTVCJF8?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018693&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ddr5-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is an excellent alternative, but it costs more than the MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi while offering the same 105A VRMs and many of the same features. From a budget perspective, the MPG Z790I Edge Wi-Fi is a much better value than other AMD and Intel mini-ITX offerings. Pairing it with a [powerful AIO cooler](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-aio-coolers/) can reduce overheating issues when running demanding workloads.

_GIGABYTE_

 Micro-ATX motherboards are like the forgotten middle child, but this motherboard packs enough of a punch to earn its place among the best DDR5 motherboards.

## FAQ

### Q: How much faster is DDR5 RAM over DDR4 RAM?

 With more memory bandwidth than DDR4, DDR5 is generally faster than DDR4 in both gaming and productivity. According to [benchmarks from TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/review/2777-ddr5-vs-ddr4-gaming/) , DDR5 can offer up to 35% performance gains in games.

### Q: Can I use DDR4 RAM in a DDR5 motherboard?

 No, DDR5 RAM uses a different pin layout than DDR4, meaning you cannot install a DDR4 RAM module on a DDR5 motherboard.

### Q: Can I use DDR6 RAM in a DDR5 motherboard?

[DDR6 is still in development](https://www.makeuseof.com/ddr6-ram-when-its-coming-what-we-know-so-far/) and hasn't been released, but if the latest DDR5 is any indication, users will need a new motherboard to use DDR6 RAM.
