### Key Takeaways

* The PlayStation Portal is a remote-play device that streams games installed locally on your PS5 via Wi-Fi.
* The PS Portal offers haptic feedback and adaptive triggers but lacks Bluetooth. It only works with PlayStation games and costs $199.99.
* For a more versatile and cost-effective option, consider a smartphone controller for access to multiple game services.

 Sony launched the PlayStation Portal in November 2023—a gaming device that looks like a DualSense controller bisected by an eight-inch screen. But what exactly is the Portal? Is it Sony’s competitor to the Nintendo Switch and SteamDeck? Or is it a cloud gaming device like the Logitech G Cloud?

![Sony PlayStation Portal product image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sony-playstation-portal-product-image.jpg)

[Sony](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/23/playstations-first-remote-play-dedicated-device-playstation-portal-remote-player-to-launch-later-this-year-at-199-99/)

 The PlayStation Portal features an eight-inch touchscreen with a 1080p resolution and 60Hz refresh rate. It also features DualSense-like controls on both sides, so it would feel familiar if you’re already a PS5 user.

 It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, Wi-Fi 5 support, and PS Link compatibility. You can charge its 4,370 mAh battery via the USB-C port, which should be enough for about seven to nine hours of gaming.

 But the PlayStation is neither a Steam Deck nor a Logitech G Cloud competitor. Instead, it’s a remote-play device that connects to your PlayStation 5 via Wi-Fi and will only stream games installed locally on your console. This is[similar to Steam Link](https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-review-ultimate-portable-gaming-console/) , which lets you play PC games on your Android or iPhone via streaming.

 So, instead of relying on a server farm to stream your game from the cloud, the PlayStation Portal will depend on your home network and PlayStation 5\. You need at least a 5Mbps connection to use the PlayStation Portal, but Sony recommends 15Mbps for reliability.

Furthermore, you need a PlayStation Network account to use it.

## What Can You Do With the PS Portal?

 Since the PlayStation Portal is essentially a DualSense controller with a screen that streams games from your PlayStation 5\. It also has features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers—provided the game you’re streaming is compatible with those features.

 The PlayStation Portal would work best if you use it on the same network that your console is connected to, but as long as you have decent internet speed for both devices (the PlayStation 5 console and the PlayStation Portal handheld), you can play any PlayStation 5 title while away from home. However, games that require other accessories, like[the PlayStation VR2](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-vr2-review/) , won’t work with the Portal.

![PlayStation Portal with Pulse Explore and Pulse Elite wireless audio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/playstation-portal-with-pulse-explore-and-pulse-elite-wireless-audio.jpg)

[Sony](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/23/hands-on-report-playstation-portal-remote-player-pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-and-pulse-elite-wireless-headset/)

 One downside with the Portal, though, is it doesn’t have Bluetooth connectivity. That means your AirPods and other Bluetooth accessories won’t work with the device. If you want personal audio, use one of[the best wired gaming headsets](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-pc-gaming-headset/) or a PlayStation Link-compatible audio device, like the Pulse Elite, Explore, or 3D.

 It also doesn’t have streaming compatibility from outside servers, so even if you[have a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-playstation-plus/) , you can’t stream titles directly to the PlayStation Portal. Instead, you must install any title you’re interested in on your PlayStation 5 and stream it to the handheld device.

## Should You Buy the PlayStation Portal?

 If you’re a big PlayStation fan and find yourself missing your games whenever you’re not home, the PlayStation Portal is for you. With this handheld device, you basically take your PlayStation 5 with you wherever you are, as long as you have a robust 5G data connection.

 However, the Portal will not work on slower data connections like 4G, so you have to consider that if your area doesn't have that. Furthermore, it doesn't have a browser, so the Portal won't work with most hotel and public Wi-Fi infrastructure that require logging in via a browser.

 If you don't want to just stream PS5 games, you might be better off getting a smartphone gaming controller like[the GameSir X2s Type-C Controller](https://www.makeuseof.com/gamesir-x2s-type-c-controller-review/) . That way, you can use it for non-PlayStation services, like Steam and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or even for playing AAA games straight from your phone. Plus, these controllers cost less than $50.
