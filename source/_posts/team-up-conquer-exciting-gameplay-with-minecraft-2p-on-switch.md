## Team Up, Conquer: Exciting Gameplay with Minecraft 2P on Switch

 Playing multiplayer games with your friends is always a good time, but it can be difficult to do your own thing when you’re sharing the same screen. Usually, one player gets pulled along wherever the other wants to go, and there has to be some sort of compromise. But did you know that if you’re playing Minecraft on a console like the Nintendo Switch, you can play multiplayer split-screen?

 If you want to split your screen with up to four players locally or online and fully enjoy the freedom of Minecraft on the Nintendo Switch, here’s how.

## What Do I Need to Play Two-Player Minecraft on My Nintendo Switch?

 All you need to split your screen and start crafting away on the Switch with your friends is a Nintendo Switch console, Minecraft, and two controllers. The only hardware requirement that it takes to get split-screen multiplayer up and running is a screen that supports at least 720p, but the Switch already has that covered for you.

 Building an absolutely epic Minecraft city with your friends on split-screen multiplayer could easily take upwards of one hundred hours or more in some cases. The last thing you want is to accidentally delete that Minecraft world and erase all the hard work that went into creating it.

 Backing up anything of importance is always a great idea, so why not add your Minecraft server to that list?[Backing up and restoring deleted Minecraft worlds](https://www.makeuseof.com/minecraft-world-how-to-restore/) can be done on many different devices, but it's much easier to back your world up in the first place than struggle to restore it later. Always make sure you make a copy of your world regularly to prevent any tragic mishaps.

## Minecraft Is More Fun With a Friend

 Many things are more fun with a friend, and Minecraft is no exception. There is something so nostalgic about playing split-screen multiplayer, and this feature is only available on the console version of Minecraft, so make sure you take advantage of it next time you have a friend over and are feeling particularly creative. Many hands make light work, after all.
