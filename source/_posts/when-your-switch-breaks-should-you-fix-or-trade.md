## When Your Switch Breaks, Should You Fix or Trade?

 It's inevitable that, at some point, you will experience hardware issues with your consoles. Luckily, If you happen to be experiencing problems with your Nintendo Switch, the process for booking an official repair with Nintendo is straightforward and may even be free.

## How to Find the Serial Number of Your Nintendo Switch

 The first thing you need to be aware of when looking to repair your Switch with Nintendo is how to find its serial number. This is required throughout Nintendo's repair process.

 Generally, you can find a label detailing the serial number on your Switch itself. However, the model and make of your console determines where this label will be. For an original Switch, the serial number is on the console's base. But for the OLED Switch, it's located under the stand.

 Alternatively, the box that your Switch came in, if purchased new, will have the serial number on it as well. But even with these methods, the serial numbers on your Switch may fade over time, and there's no guarantee the box serial number is original. Luckily, there is a universal way to discover your console's serial number.

 To find the serial number of your Switch, regardless of its model, turn your console on and follow these steps:

* From the Home screen of your Nintendo Switch, select**System Settings** .
* Under the left-hand-side options, highlight**System** .
* Select**Serial Numbers** .

 From here, your console serial number and those of the battery and Joy-Con will be displayed on-screen. However, while this method works universally, if your Switch is non-functioning or won't turn on, you'll have to find the serial number by analyzing your console or its original box.

## Check Your Nintendo Switchâ€™s Warranty Status

 Now you know the serial number of your Switch, you can move on with checking the warranty status of your console and booking a repair. It's important to check the warranty status of your Switch beforehand as if your console is under warranty, Nintendo will likely repair your console for free.

 Luckily, if you have the serial number of your Switch on hand, the process of checking the warranty status of your console is simple. To check the warranty status of your Switch, follow these steps:

* Enter the official Nintendo Repair Center page on any browser by following this link to[Nintendo](https://repair.nintendo.com/cc/ntndcpWarrantyStatus.html?lang=en) .
* Under**Check Warranty Status** , enter the serial number of your Nintendo Switch.
* Select**Check Warranty** .

 Under**Warranty Information** , Nintendo will then provide all the details of your console's warranty status, including whether it is under warranty and the**Warranty Expiration Date** .

 Unfortunately, if your console is out of warranty, you will have to pay for the repair of your console. Similarly, screen damage voids the warranty of your Switch, and screen repairs are not covered under the warranty.

 However, it may be worth checking some[common fixes for Nintendo Switch problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-nintendo-switch-problems/) before booking a repair. This way, you may avoid any repair fees if your console is out of warranty.
