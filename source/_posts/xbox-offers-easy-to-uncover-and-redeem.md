## Xbox Offers: Easy to Uncover and Redeem

 When any new console is released, it's inevitable that a ton of different bundle offers for each version of the console are released, each with its own collection of games or accessories to entice you in.

 Traditional games or rewards bundled with your console would come physically in the box, or at least via a digital code, but Xbox Series X|S games are instead linked to your console itself. But if that's the case, how do you go about redeeming your game? Let's find out.

## What Is a Digital Direct Xbox Offer?

 In short, physical or digital game codes for your bundled games or subscriptions have been replaced by Digital Direct offers linked to your Xbox console. Instead of validating a digital code, you should be able to redeem your unique game directly from your console.

 So Digital Direct offers represent a digital freebie unique to your Xbox upon purchase. But while this change may seem intuitive and removes any need to input a code, the system isn't without issues.

 In this way, Digital Direct offers on Xbox Series X|S can be hard to track down and redeem, so there are a few aspects of the feature that you need to be aware of:

* Digital Direct offers might be associated with your console, but once claimed they are account-specific and can only be played on the account they were redeemed by.
* However, Digital Direct offers can be redeemed by any Xbox account, so you can share the game with other people if you aren't interested yourself.
* Digital Direct offers also don't have to be claimed immediately and will remain on your Xbox until you claim the offer for a specific Xbox account.

 While the above points may seem trivial, the process for redeeming your Digital Direct offer can become quite confusing, especially if you want to save your offer for later. Luckily, if you simply want to claim the offer immediately, the process is simple.

## How to Activate Your Digital Direct Offers From Your Xbox

 Now you know what form your free game or offer comes with after buying a new Xbox Series X|S bundle, you're ready to activate and redeem it. And as long as you haven't already set up your new console, the process is easy.

 Upon first turning your new Xbox on, follow the set-up guide, and you should eventually see a**This Xbox comes with** notification showing your Digital Direct offer. From here, you can select**Claim it** ,**Decide later** , or**Redeem for another account** . To redeem your offer immediately for the Xbox account you're signed into, select**Claim it** .

 If you instead want to save your offer for later, select**Decide later** . But if you need to transfer ownership of your offer to another Xbox account, you should choose**Redeem for another account** , and follow the on-screen guidance to add a new Xbox account to your console.

 But with**Claim it** selected, your Digital Direct offer will be unlocked and available within**My games & apps** on your console. Unfortunately, if you want to alter your offer or if you selected**Decide later** or**Redeem for another account** , the process is more complex and more akin to[managing your Xbox subscriptions from your console](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manage-xbox-subscriptions-from-xbox-series-x-s/) .

## What to Do if You Declined Your Digital Direct Offer

 If you didn't immediately claim your Digital Direct offer, you may be slightly confused about where the offer has gone and how to redeem it. Worse still, there's no notification informing you where to redeem your offer at a later date.

 Luckily, there is a dedicated place for you to redeem Digital Direct offers on your Xbox, so you don't have to worry about ever losing your deal. If you've failed to redeem or declined to redeem your Direct Digital offer for your new Xbox, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the guide menu on your Xbox Series X|S.
* Highlight the tab for**Profile & system** , and select**Settings** .

* Under the options for**Account** , select**Included with this Xbox** .

* Once the**This Xbox comes with** message reappears, ensure you are on the Xbox account you wish to redeem your offer for, and select**Claim it** .

 Your Digital Direct offer will then be redeemed and available, as mentioned previously, within your**My games & apps** library on your console.

 While redeeming your Digital Direct offer should be one of the[first things you need to do with your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/first-things-to-do-with-xbox-series-x/) , there are many reasons you may want to wait to redeem your offer, including moving it to another account. And despite being hidden, the**Included with this Xbox** option guarantees you can access your offer.

## Never Miss Any Xbox Games or Offers With Xbox Series X|S

 While the process can become a bigger issue than necessary, the Digital Direct system of receiving free game bundles with Xbox consoles does at least have ways to guarantee you can always access your offersâ€”even if they are tucked away in settings.

 And with game prices rising ever higher throughout each generation, guaranteed bundled game redemption can help to ease some of the price hikes for the Xbox platform as a whole.
