## Notifying of Violations: How to Report On-Screen Offenses (Xbox)

 Online gaming on any platform can come with its fair share of unwanted social experiences, or even online abuse. Gaming with an Xbox Series X|S is unfortunately no different. What can set each platform apart, however, is the tools and systems in place to help you avoid, navigate, and deal with inappropriate online behavior.

 If you choose the Xbox Series X|S as your console of choice, there are tons of ways of dealing with each form of inappropriate behavior you may encounter, but this can get confusing. So, if you're looking for a way to report people's behavior on Xbox, we can help.

## 1\. How to Report an Xbox Playerâ€™s Profile

 Commonly, if you experience inappropriate online behavior while playing on Xbox, you might not get the chance to report or deal with the behavior while still in your game. Luckily, the most common way of reporting other Xbox players relies on the**Recently played with** option to report the Xbox profile of the offending user.

 To report an offending Xbox player's profile on your Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* Navigate to**People** , and select**Recently played with** .

![A screenshot of the Guide menu for Xbox Series X with the options for People highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2980.jpg)

* Select the Xbox profile of the person who displayed inappropriate behavior.
* Choose the option for**Report or block** , followed by**Report** .

![A screenshot of the options for an Xbox Profile on Xbox Series X with the ability to Report highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2983.jpg)

 From here, you can choose various reasons for submitting your report, like**Unsporting behavior** . Once you have selected the reasons for reporting the player, select**Submit** to send your report.

 It's also important to note that you can access people's profiles in multiple ways. You can even [report players via your Xbox console or the Xbox app](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-one-xbox-app-how-to-block-and-report-users/) .

## 2\. How to Report Inappropriate Xbox Messages

 Aside from experiencing inappropriate behavior from in-game gameplay or a way associated with a player's profile, another common form of social disruption is presented through online messaging.

 Whether it's through obvious scams, rage-fuelled hate messages, or even inappropriate content, toxic messaging is ripe on Xbox Series X|S. However, your Xbox also has a direct way to deal with and report messages in particular. To specifically report messages on your Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the options for**Parties & chats** , and select**Chats** .

![A screenshot of the Parties and Chats section of the Xbox Series X Guide menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2989.jpg)

* Select the conversation that contains the inappropriate messages you received.
* Choose the**More** option at the end of the conversation history, and select**Report person** .

![A screenshot of the available options for Xbox Chats with Report Person highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2992.jpg)

 Just as with reporting an Xbox profile, you will then be able to select specific reasons for reporting the player. However, by reporting them through**Chats** , you are linking the report to the player's messages, making it more likely action will be taken.

## 3\. How to Report Inappropriate Behavior in the Xbox Activity Feed

 Much like how you can report Xbox players through messages you receive, you can also specifically report players through the content you see on the Xbox Activity Feed.

 Whether through inappropriate game captures, comments, or Xbox Clubs, the content in your Xbox Activity Feed is all reportable. So, with that in mind, if you want to report inappropriate content you find in the Xbox Activity Feed, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu.
* Select**My games & apps** , followed by**See all** .

![A screenshot of the My Games and Apps page of an Xbox Series X Guide with See All highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/see-all.jpg)

* Highlight**Apps** , and open the**Friends & Community Updates** application.

![A screenshot of the Apps section of My Games and Apps on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2995.jpg)

* From here, select the game capture or post you want to report.
* With the post open, choose**More actions** , followed by**Report** .

![A screenshot of the available options for a post on the Xbox Activity Feed with the ability to Report highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-3001.jpg)

 Like with any other Xbox report, you can then define the specific categories of your report and hit**Submit** to finalize it. With the report linked to an individual Xbox Activity Feed post, you can rest assured that Xbox will be able to evaluate your report with the evidence provided.

 However, your own Xbox Activity Feed content can just as easily be flagged by other users. So, it's important when you post a game capture or [create an Xbox Club](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-a-club-on-xbox-series-x-s/) that you're confident the content is appropriate.

## 4\. How to Report In-Game Voice Chat on Xbox Series X|S

 A final way you can report inappropriate content on your Xbox, and the most unique way, is by highlighting inappropriate voice communications to Xbox.

 However, to report voice chats, you need to have saved 60-second voice clips onto your Xbox. Luckily, you can [record and report in-game voice chat from your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-save-and-report-in-game-voice-chat-on-xbox-series-xs/) . To record voice chat, follow these steps:

* Open the Guide menu by pressing the**Xbox button** on your controller.
* Highlight**Parties & chats** , and select the bottom option for**Report in-game voice chat** .

![A screenshot of the Parties and Chats section of the Guide menu for Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/guide-menu.jpg)

* Select**Save voice clip (last 60s)** .

![A screenshot of the Report In Game Voice Chat settings on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/save-voice-clip.jpg)

 With voice clips featuring evidence of inappropriate behavior saved to your Xbox, you can move forward with reporting in-game voice chat by following these steps:

* Re-enter the**Report in-game voice chat** section of the Xbox Guide menu.
* Select**Review saved clips** .

![A screenshot of the Saved Voice Clips menu on Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saved-voice-clips.jpg)

* Choose the clip you saved that features the inappropriate behavior you wish to report.

 Much like other reporting methods, your Xbox will then ask you to define specific elements of the report associated with voice chats. Once you have defined these elements, like associated Xbox profiles and Gamertags, you can select**Submit Report** to finalize.

## Report Toxic Gaming and Keep Your Xbox Experience Safe

 With so many ways to report toxic behavior on Xbox, you can work to remove inappropriate players not only from your gaming circle but also from the platform as a whole.

 And as Xbox supports your Xbox Friends and gaming communities, you can simultaneously enhance and protect your online gaming experience, especially on Xbox Series X|S.
