## Transition Smoothly Into Steam's Full Display Mode

 Steam's Big Picture mode lets you navigate Steam with only a controller, no mouse or keyboard required. If you play a lot of games with a controller or use Steam in a living room gaming setup, Big Picture mode could be just what you're looking for to take your gaming rig to the next level.

 If that sounds like something you would be interested in, this article will explain exactly what Steam's Big Picture mode is and how to use it.

## What Is Steam's Big Picture Mode?

 Big Picture mode is a Steam feature that gives the platform an all-new user interface. This UI is easy to navigate with a controller and features larger font to make it easier to read when you're gaming on television screens. This allows you to enjoy your Steam games from the comfort of your sofa rather than perched at your desk, hunched over your computer.

 Big Picture mode looks similar to the home screen interfaces of many of your favorite video game consoles. It provides you with all the functionality of the desktop app but in a new easy-to-read format.

## Controller Support Levels

 Although you can open any Steam game in Big Picture mode, not every game has full controller support. Steam uses controller icons to show controller compatibility.

 If you see a partially-filled controller icon next to a game's title, that game offers partial controller support. The use of a mouse and keyboard may be necessary while downloading, launching, or playing the game.

 If you see a filled-in controller icon next to a game's title, that game offers full controller support. You should be able to download, launch, and play this game with only a controller.

## You Can Now Use Steam's Big Picture Mode

 This has been a basic guide on how to use Steam's Big Picture mode. If you use a controller while gaming on a PC or television, you can now enter Big Picture mode whenever you wish. It is as easy as holding the home button down on your controller.

 Now you can get comfy and enjoy Steam from the warm embrace of your sofa rather than straining your back by hovering over your desk with a mouse and keyboard.
