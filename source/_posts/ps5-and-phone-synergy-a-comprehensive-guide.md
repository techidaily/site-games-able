## Which Smartphones Are Compatible With the PS5 Controller?

 The[PlayStation website](https://www.playstation.com/en-au/support/hardware/pair-dualsense-controller-bluetooth/#supported) states that the DualSense Controller is compatible with devices running Android 12 or later and iOS 14.5 or later. However, we were able to test the method on a device running Android 11 with no issues.

 Not all Android devices are compatible with the DualSense Controller, however. The PlayStation website suggests consulting your device’s manufacturer to see if your device is compatible with the controller or not.

 You can find information about your device’s manufacturer in the**About phone** section of your device settings.

 But if that’s too much effort, you can also follow the steps below to see if it works for you. If not, you may have to stick with another Bluetooth controller for your mobile gaming endeavors.

## How to Connect Your PS5 Controller to an Android Device

 You can connect your DualSense to an Android device running Android 11/12 or later. To check what operating software your device is running, head to your device’s settings by pressing the**Settings app** .

 Scroll down to**About phone** , and select**Software information** . There, you will be able to see what Android version you are currently running, and update it if necessary.

 To begin connecting your PS5 controller to your Android device, head back to your**Settings** and press**Connections** .

 Ensure the**Bluetooth toggle** is on and press the**Bluetooth tab** to open the menu.

 Turn your attention to your controller, making sure the controller is off. If not, hold the PS button down for around seven seconds or until the controller light turns off.

 Put your controller in pairing mode by holding the Create and PS buttons down simultaneously. It should only take around three seconds before your controller light starts flashing to indicate it is in pairing mode.

 If you're unsure[what the DualSense Create button is](https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-create-button/) , it's the small oval button on the left side of the touchpad.

 Once you do, select it, and your phone will connect to your controller.

[Connecting your DualSense Controller to your Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-mac/) and other Apple devices is also possible, but connecting to your iPhone is by far the most convenient option, especially if you are looking for something portable.

## How to Reconnect Your DualSense Controller to Your PS5

 You won't want to use your DualSense with your mobile device forever and there will come a time when you want to connect your controller back to your PS5\. Thankfully, doing so is very easy and will take just a few minutes.

 Begin by switching your PS5 console on. You can then reconnect your controller manually using a USB-A to USB-C cable. Plug the USB-A side into your console and the USB-C side into the slot at the top of your controller. The controller will reconnect automatically.

![Bluetooth Accessories tab in General PS5 Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bluetooth-accessories-tab-in-general-ps5-settings.jpg)

 You can also reconnect wirelessly using Bluetooth if you have two controllers, as long as one is synced already.

 Using your primary controller, head to your PS5**Settings** and head to**Accessories** . Open**Bluetooth Accessories** from the**General** tab and place your controller back into pairing mode by holding the Create and PS buttons down. Once the second controller appears, select it to reconnect to your PS5.

 Using touchscreen controls to game on your mobile device can be clunky and difficult, and your thumbs end up covering a large part of your display. Using any Bluetooth controller will vastly improve your mobile gaming experience. But since the DualSense is one of the best controllers on the market, it will massively level up the experience of gaming on your phone.
