## Tackling Non-Display Issues in Epic Games Libraries

 Has Epic Games stopped showing the games within your library? Most of the time, it’s a minor glitch that you can fix by restarting Epic Games Launcher or re-authenticating your account.

 Even if it’s a more serious problem, we’ve put together a list of solutions to help you get your games back.

## 1\. Refresh the Library

 Sometimes, Epic Games Launcher might have a syncing issue and fail to display newly bought games. In this case, all you have to do is refresh the library. Within the desktop app, open the**Library** and click on the**Refresh** icon.

## 2\. Restart the Epic Games Launcher

 If refreshing the library didn’t fix the issue, try restarting the Epic Games Launcher app. This way, you stop its processes from running in the background and give it a fresh start. Once you close the app, press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to bring up the Task Manager.

 Open the**Processes** tab and stop any Epic Games-related process from running.

 Then, relaunch the app and check if all of your games are now showing within the library.

## 3\. Log Out and Log In to Epic Game

 Another quick fix that you can try is to log out and log back in. This way, you force Epic Games Launcher to verify your account information and display your complete library. Also, make sure you’ve logged in using the right account.

 If there’s someone else with an Epic Games account using the same device as you, you’ll see only the games purchased by their account.

## 4\. Check the Game’s Availability

 As you may know, you can[get free games on the Epic Games store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-free-games-on-the-epic-games-store/) . Besides its permanent free games catalog, you can get a new free game every week. However, not every free game is yours forever.

![Check the game's availability on Epic Games](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/check-availability-1.jpg)

 A game might have limited availability which is why you can no longer see it in your library. In this case, go to the Epic Store and check the game’s status.

## 5\. Unhide the Game Library

 Epic Games allows you to hide your games in case you don’t want a younger sibling to play games with inappropriate content. Or if you don’t want to lose your competitive rank. Either way, if you can’t find any games, you should check if you didn’t hide them.

 In the Epic Games app, click on your profile icon and go to Settings. Then, from the**Preferences** section, uncheck the**Hide Game Library** option. Once you go back to your library, you should see your games list.

## 6\. Remove Library Filters

 The Epic Games app allows you to sort your titles depending on genre, features, and supported platforms, among other criteria. If certain titles are missing from your library, chances are you’ve set a filter and forgot about it. To check out every title in your library, you should remove Epic Games library filters.

 In the Library tab, click on**Filters** and uncheck the options. Alternatively, if there are multiple filters, click**Reset** . Then, refresh the library and check if all of your games are now visible.

## 7\. Delete the Epic Games Launcher Cache

## Bring Back Your Epic Games Library
