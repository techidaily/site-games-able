## Perfecting Ambiance: Tailoring Console Lights on Xbox

 Xbox consoles offer a plethora of cool features that enhance your gaming experience. However, there's one feature you might not be aware of: the ability to adjust the brightness of your Xbox controller and console light.

 This often-overlooked capability allows you to customize your gaming experience even further and comes in handy, especially when you’re gaming in a dark environment and would like to turn off the lights altogether. Read below for a step-by-step guide on the process.

## How to Adjust the Brightness of Your Xbox Controller Light

 The Xbox controller light is a useful indicator of when your controller is on. This light is set to full brightness by default. However, if, due to some reason, you wish to dim or turn off the light of your controller, Xbox provides a built-in option for you to do so.

 Follow these steps to adjust the brightness of your Xbox controller’s light:

1. Turn on your Xbox console and[ensure that your Xbox controller is connected](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sync-xbox-one-controller/) . Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the guide.
2. Navigate to the**Profile & system** tab and select**Settings** from the menu options by pressing**A** on your controller.

3. Now, go to**General > TV & display options > Night mode** .  
![General settings on Xbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tv-and-display-options-xbox-setting-1.jpeg)
4. Under**Preferences** , you’d see the option for**Controller brightness** . Select this and press**A** to access the settings for controller brightness.

5. Check the box next to**Customize brightness** to highlight the slider for brightness adjustment. Select the**Default brightness** option and slide the on-screen slider using the D-pad or the left thumbstick to increase or decrease brightness. You can either slide the slider all the way to the left to turn the light off or adjust brightness across seven different brightness levels according to your preference.

6. Once you are satisfied with the brightness level, press**B** on your controller or press the**Xbox button** and select**Home** to exit the settings menu.

 Now, every time you turn on your Xbox controller, the light will automatically be adjusted to the set brightness. However, if you see a blinking light or no light on your controller, it's possible that your[Xbox controller is not working properly](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-fix-xbox-one-controller-not-working/) , and you might need to fix it.

## How to Adjust the Brightness of Your Xbox Console Light

 In addition to the controller’s light, Xbox also allows you to adjust the brightness of the power button light on its console device. The default brightness for the console light is also set to full. The steps to achieve this are similar to adjusting the controller’s light:

1. Go to **Settings > General > TV & display options > Night Mode** .
2. Under**Preferences** , select**Power button brightness** and press**A** .  
![Xbox power button brightness setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-power-button-brightness-setting-1.jpeg)
3. Select and check the checkbox next to**Customize brightness** . Doing so highlights the slider for adjusting the console light’s brightness. Unlike the controller light, which has seven different brightness levels, there are only three brightness options for the console’s light. You can either completely turn it off, keep it at a 50% brightness level or increase the brightness to a full 100%.
