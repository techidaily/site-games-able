## Enhancing PC Gaming: Fixing Steam Remote Link Failures

 Steam's Remote Play is a useful feature that allows you to play your favorite Steam titles from any modern handheld and other devices. You can use the Steam Link app on your phone or another computer to stream games you have installed on your primary computer.

 While a handy feature, Steam Remote Play can be erratic and may suddenly stop working. If your internet connection speed is not an issue, your Steam client on Windows may be acting up. Here's how to troubleshoot and fix the problem.

## 3\. Update Steam Client and Games

![UPDATE STEAM client](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/update-steam-client.jpg)

 An outdated Steam client can cause some features to malfunction. In other instances, running an older version of a game can cause Remote Play to act up.

 The Steam client auto-checks and updates every time you launch the app. However, you can also manually check for an update from the interface. Steam automatically installs game updates, so you don’t need to do anything to install game updates.

To check for Steam client updates:

1. Launch the app and click on**Steam** in the top left corner.
2. Select**Check for Steam Client Updates.**
3. Steam will scan for a new update and install it if available.

 You’ll need to restart Steam to apply the updates. If no update is available, you’ll see the “Your client is up-to-date” message.

## 5\. Disable IPv6 for Your Network Adapter

 Big Picture Mode on Steam lets you view your games in a full-screen user interface. If you are trying to use Remote Play on another computer or TV, enter the Big Picture Mode then and start streaming. It's a tried and tested workaround that seems to remedy Remote Play issues.

To use Big Picture Mode on Steam:

1. Launch the**Steam** client.
2. Click**Big Picture Mode** (full-screen icon) in the top right corner.
3. Steam will now show in full-screen mode on your guest device. Browse through the library and start streaming.
4. To exit Big Picture Mode, press**Alt + F4** on your keyboard.

 This is not a permanent solution but a handy workaround. However, it should help you get around the issue temporarily.

## 7\. Disable and Configure Your Antivirus and Firewall

 Your antivirus or firewall can block genuine outgoing connections causing Remote Play to stop working. You can temporarily disable your firewall to determine if it is blocking a port or program.

 If you are using third-party antivirus, it is likely to feature its own firewall. Open the antivirus app settings and turn off the firewall option. If not, follow these steps to disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
2. Open the**Privacy & security** tab.  
![windows security settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-security-settings.jpg)
3. Next, click on**Firewall & network protection.**  
![windows security settings firewall network protection](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-security-settings-firewall-network-protection.jpg)
4. Choose your active network under**Firewall & network protection.**  
![turn off windows defender firewall](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/turn-off-windows-defender-firewall.jpg)
5. Toggle the switch under**Microsoft Defender Firewall** to turn it off.

 Next, try to stream using Remote Play to see if the connection goes through. If yes, you'll need to learn[how to allow apps through Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) . Make sure to re-enable your firewall, irrespective of the result.

## 8\. Disable and Re-Enable Steam Overlay

2. Click on**Steam** in the top right corner and select**Settings** .  
![steam setting pc](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-setting-pc.jpg)
3. Next, open the**In-Game** tab in the left pane.
4. Here, check the**Enable Steam Overlay while in-game** option.  
![enable steam overlay while in game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/enable-steam-overlay-while-in-game.jpg)
5. Next, configure the Overlay shortcut keys if you want. Else, leave it as default.
6. Click**OK** to save the changes.
7. Next, launch the game you want to stream and then open**Steam Overlay** using the**Shift + Tab** key or your custom key.

2. Click on**Steam** and select**Settings** .

5. In the pop-up dialog, uncheck the**Enable hardware encoding** option.
6. Click**OK** to save the changes and disable hardware encoding.

## 10\. Reinstall the Steam Client

 As a last resort, try to uninstall and reinstall the Steam client to fix any issues that may be occurring due to issues with the client itself. You can reinstall the Steam client without deleting your existing games.

To uninstall the Steam client:

1. Exit Steam if running in the background.
2. Next, press**Win + E** to open File Explorer.  
![steamapp folder steam move](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steamapp-folder-steam-move.jpg)

4. Once done, press**Win + I** to open**Settings** .
5. Next, open the**Apps** tab.  
![windows 11 settings installed apps](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-11-settings-installed-apps.jpg)
6. Click on**Installed Apps** and search for**Steam** .
7. Click the three-dots menu beside the app name and click**Uninstall** .  
![uninstall steam client windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uninstall-steam-client-windows-11.jpg)
8. Click**Yes** to confirm the action.
9. Click**Uninstall** again and click**Yes** if prompted by UAC.
10. Next, go to the[Steam download page](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and download the installer to install the app.
11. Once Steam is installed, move the**SteamApps** folder back to**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ Steam** so that the client can recognize your installed games.

## Fix Remote Play and Start Streaming Steam Games

 An easy way to fix issues with Remote Play is to install the Steam Link app on your guest and host system. If not, try to re-enable Remote Play or unpair your paired devices to fix the problem. Additionally, check your firewall and IPv4 settings to fix network-related issues.
