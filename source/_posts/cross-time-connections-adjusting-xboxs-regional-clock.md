## What You Need to Know About Changing Time Zone on Xbox

 The last few important things to know before you change your time zone on Xbox are how altering the setting will affect your console, and what you may need to do to ensure that your Time zone is changed successfully.

 The most information you may need to know before changing your time zone or any other option within the Time settings for your Xbox is as follows:

* It is best to alter the**Time** settings on your Xbox while disconnected from the Xbox network. This guarantees your choices won't be overwritten by Internet preferences.
* Changing your time zone may not alter the in-game time for all games, especially if the game you're playing runs off its own online services, like live service Xbox games.
* Altering your time zone can affect when the**Shutdown** power option attempts to save energy by updating at night. Changing when your console recognizes night would interfere with energy saving, and you may need to[adjust your Xbox Series X|S power settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-customize-xbox-series-x-s-power-options-to-save-energy/) accordingly.
