## Tearing Down Recent Xbox Controller Update

 Frequently released, and sometimes mandatory updates, for your gaming consoles and accessories usually work to improve the platforms you choose to game on. But much like any piece of tech, an update can cause unwanted changes or new problems.

 Luckily, if you want to revert a nasty controller update for your Xbox Wireless Controller, you can use your Xbox Series X|S to do so. But how do you revert the firmware of your Xbox Wireless Controller? Let's find out.

## Things to Note Before Reverting Your Xbox Wireless Controller's Firmware

 Before you go through with reverting an Xbox Wireless Controller update, there are a few things you should know beforehand, as the process has a few caveats. Specifically, the main points you should be aware of before reverting firmware for your controller are as follows:

* Most commonly, reverting an Xbox Wireless Controller update will correct issues with Bluetooth connectivity to non-Xbox devices, like a laptop. If the issue with your controller affects how it functions with your Xbox Series X|S, it isn't guaranteed that reverting the firmware will help.
* You are more likely to experience issues from Xbox updates if you[join the Xbox Insider Program](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-xbox-insider/) . You may want to leave the program to prevent further firmware issues.
* Reverting the firmware of Xbox Wireless Controllers on your Xbox Series X|S isn't compatible with some older controller models.

 While these factors can prevent a firmware reset from correcting your controller issue, there are still ways you can fix your specific problem. If the issue is tied to your console, you may want to[troubleshoot your Xbox Series X|S by placing it in Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-xs-safe-mode-startup-troubleshooter/) or exiting the Xbox Preview Program.

 But if the caveats of reverting firmware don't apply to you, your controller issue is likely caused by a firmware problem, and you're all set to go ahead with reverting your controller update.
