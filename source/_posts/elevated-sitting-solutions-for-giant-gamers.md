## Elevated Sitting Solutions for Giant Gamers

 If you're a gamer or a streamer, you probably spend a lot of time at your desk. Because of this, you need a gaming chair that gives you the right amount of comfort and support.

 Most gaming chairs these days have comfortable, reinforced seat cushioning and provide decent lumber support. They are also sturdy enough to take the weight of larger gamers without compromising the integrity of the chair itself.

 But what about taller gamers? If you're more than six feet tall, it can be tricky to find a gaming chair that suits your needs. You need something tall enough to support your back and head without causing any backaches or neck pain.

Here are the best gaming chairs for tall people.

##### Fantasylab Big and Tall 440lb Memory Foam Gaming Chair

 Affordable comfort for big and tall gamers

 $247$266 Save $19

 With the Fantasylab Big and Tall 440lb Memory Foam Gaming Chair, big and tall gamers on a budget have a solid option to boost their game time. With memory foam cushioning and fully adjustable lumbar support, plus a 155-degree angle adjuster, you can find the perfect level of comfort for you.

**Pros**

* Quality upholstered finish
* Deep and wide seat
* Memory foam cushioning
* One of the more affordable options

**Cons**

* Wheels feel a little bit weak compared to the rest of the chair

[$247 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F358-048U-00001) [$250 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Big-Tall-Gaming-Chair-440lb-Gamer-Gel-Cold-Cure-Foam-Lumbar-Office-4d-Adjustable-Arms-Heavy-Duty-Metal-Base-Computer-Gamers-Workers-Black/1712700518)

 If you’re looking to save a few pennies (and let’s be honest, who isn’t?), the Fantasylab Big & Tall Memory Foam Gaming Chair is a worthy choice for gamers on a budget. It can comfortably seat people over six feet tall and offers a maximum weight capacity of 440 pounds. It also offers a nice, wide seating area, as well as a wider back area for added comfort.

 Cushioning is made from old cure memory foam on the seat and back rest, and cold cure gel foam on the separate lumbar seat cushion. The fabric on the chair is a racing-style PU leather and provides a nice quality finish. The chair features fully adjustable 4D armrests and can be fully reclined up to 155 degrees.

 On the downside, despite the generous weight limit offered by this chair, the wheels themselves are not the sturdiest. Therefore, you may experience some degradation over time, which could potentially include the odd crack of a wheel after extensive use. However, this shouldn’t put you off, as this remains an excellent gaming chair for taller and bigger gamers, especially at this price point.

Best for Posture

##### Maxnomic Titanus Black Gaming Chair

 Keeps you sitting up straight in perfect comfort

 With the Maxnomic Titanus Black Gaming Chair, you can ensure your posture doesn't slack without compromising on comfort. Plus, with an ultra-sturdy steel frame and class-4 gas spring, it's perfect for bigger gamers, too.

**Pros**

* Keeps you sitting correctly
* Suitable for people up to 6'9"
* Ergonomically shaped backrest
* 4D adjustable armrests

**Cons**

* Not the most visually appealing

[$590 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/MAXNOMIC-TITANUS-BLACK/219469272)

 The Maxnomic Titanus Black Gaming Chair can happily accommodate gamers that stand up to six feet and nine inches tall and weigh up to 385 pounds. It comes with a sturdy steel frame, a class 4 gas spring, a heavy-duty tilt mechanism, and 4D adjustable armrests.

 Custom molded cold-cured foam has been used for the seat cushioning, and this has been wrapped up in PU leather to provide a quality finish. The Titanus Black also features an ergonomic backrest that encourages correct posture without skimping on comfort.

 For the price, a separate lumbar cushion or headrest would have been nice. And though undeniably comfortable, the actual seating area doesn’t look quite as inviting as some of the other available options. Nevertheless, the Titanus Black has been constructed to a very high standard and provides plenty of adjustable comforts for taller gamers to consider.

 Recommended for gamers up to six feet eight inches tall, and supporting a maximum weight of 400 pounds, the Vertagear PL6800 is another great choice of gaming chair for the vertically unchallenged. It’s equipped with eight hexagonal pillars, populated with air tunnels that allow for four-way air emission to allow breathability and long-term comfort.

 Upholstered with premium quality automotive grade PU leather that’s guaranteed not to crack for five years, the AKRacing Masters Series Pro is out to impress. It’s recommended for anyone between five feet seven inches and six feet six inches tall and supports a maximum weight of 290 pounds.

 The Series Pro features an extra strong high tensile aluminum base, that boasts 20 times the strength of steel.

## Finding the Right Gaming Chair for You

 Choosing the right kind of gaming chair comes down to personal preference. You know how you like to sit and what you find comfortable. If you're a tall gamer, you'll obviously want to ensure that your chair of choice can accommodate you. Plus, if you happen to be on the heavier side, you also want something that provides adequate support. These are the basics.

 But beyond this, consider the level of lumbar support offered. Think about the adjustability factor. Maybe you prefer your armrests in different positions, depending on whether you're using your chair for gaming or working. Do you prefer to sit upright, or recline right back for your gaming sessions? How good is the upholstery? Good enough to last for years, or likely to crack and peel in just a few months?

 Providing excellent comfort with a high-quality finish, the Secretlab Titan Evo Dark Knight Gaming Chair is the ultimate dream for Batman fans. Fully adjustable, with 4D armrests, lumbar support, and a magnetic headrest too. This premium gaming chair does come with a premium price tag. But for those who can afford it, this is a luxury gaming chair that wouldn't look out of place deep inside the bowels of Wayne Manor.

 For something that's a bit kinder on the purse strings, you could consider something like the Fantasylab Bit and Tall Gaming Chair, which will save you a considerable amount of money compared to many of its rivals. With memory foam cushioning, plus an ultra-wide seat and backrest, it provides plenty of comfort. Plus, it's adjustable enough that you can find the Goldilocks position that's just right for you.

 But for superior comfort, durability, aesthetic appeal, and price point, the Razer Iskur XL Gaming Chair is the pick of the bunch. Hitting that sweet spot between the key factors that count, you'll enjoy a premium feel and look, with a sleek design that provides for customizable comfort. The end result is a highly desirable gaming chair, perfect for taller gamers, that hits all the right notes.
