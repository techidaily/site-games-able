## XBox S Excellence - Achieving Perfect Blue-Ray

 Gaming consoles are innately gaming-orientated, but if you own an Xbox Series X, its Blu-ray drive can turn your Xbox into a great media player. And, while you have to rely on the Xbox Blu-ray player application, you can fine-tune your consoles to get the most out of your Blu-rays.

 On Xbox Series X, you can alter dedicated settings and processes to craft and improve your Blu-ray experience on the platform. But what exactly are these Blu-ray improving settings, and how can you access them? Let's find out.

## The Ways Your Xbox Can Enhance Playing Blu-rays

 Using your Xbox Series X as a Blu-ray player may appear less convenient than using a dedicated device designed for that very purpose. But the supported Blu-ray features on your Xbox can at least help close the gap between consoles and media players.

 To be specific, the following features from your Xbox Series X can help to improve your experience of Blu-rays:

* Decoding Audio—This allows you to control what audio can be heard while playing Blu-rays on your Xbox. This way, you can choose whether to silence unwanted intrusions from things like Xbox notifications.
* Dolby Digital Dynamic Range Control - Your Xbox also allows you to set preferences for Dolby Digital sound and audio. With Dynamic Range Control, you can balance out the audio of your Blu-rays to prevent any peaks or troughs of sound.
* Enabling BD Live—BD Live support allows all the digital content of your Blu-rays to be accessed on your Xbox. Even content provided digitally by movie studios, like trailers and behind-the-scenes clips, can be accessed via BD Live.

 And aside from the dedicated Blu-ray settings and features, you can also [enable closed captioning on your Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-closed-captions-xbox-series-x/) using other experience-supporting features of the console. Closed captioning, however, will only work for supported games or media.But with the above Xbox Blu-ray settings, you can universally alter and improve your experience of Blu-rays on your Series X. But how do you actually access and use these features?

## How to Fine Tune the Blu-ray Settings on Your Xbox

 Now you know the supported Blu-ray settings on your Xbox Series X, let's take a look at how you can actually enable and set them up. To access and adjust the Blu-ray settings on your Xbox Series X, follow these steps:

* From the Home screen of your Xbox Series X, press the Xbox button to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the options for**Profile & system** and select**Settings** .

 From the**Blu-ray** screen, you should be able to access all the previously mentioned settings and preferences available for your Xbox. But some of the features require a few more steps.

 For instance, to alter the**Dolby Digital** settings and set up Dynamic Range Control, you need to select**Dolby Digital** and choose either**Dynamic range control on** or**Dynamic range control auto** . If you keep the setting on, it will always be enabled, whereas the alternative will only enable Dynamic Range Control when audio requires correcting.

 Similarly, to allow your receiver to decode audio and silence any unwanted intrusions from your Xbox, select**Let my receiver decode audio** . Wait for a pop-up to appear on your screen, and select**Pass Audio To Receiver** to enable the feature.

 But whether through limiting potential interruptions to your Blu-rays or smoothing out audio for better sound, you should be well on the way to improving your Blu-ray experience with Xbox.And even outside the built-in Blu-ray features of your Series X, you could look to improve the quality of your Blu-rays even further.[Optimizing your sound settings on Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-sound-settings/) , for instance, is a perfect next step to honing the media player aspects of your Xbox Series X.

## Optimize Console Gaming for Blu-rays With Xbox Series X

 While console gaming may not intuitively be the best media player for Blu-rays, with Xbox, you can at least fine-tune and better the experience to your own taste.So in the end, console gaming can make a useful substitute for a Blu-ray player, especially with the dedicated features on Xbox. But much like anything else, even with adjustments, you may find you'll need to keep tweaking settings to find the perfect combination of preferences for your Xbox and Blu-rays.
