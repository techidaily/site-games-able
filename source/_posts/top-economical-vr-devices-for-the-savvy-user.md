## Top Economical VR Devices for the Savvy User

 Not too long ago, virtual reality was in a rather awkward place. VR headsets were far too expensive, too few studios were developing games, and you almost always needed a top-of-the-line PC. Fortunately, that's no longer the case. The tech is cheaper, game studios are finally seeing the merit in VR games, and hardware is relying less on computers.

 Whether you have a real fascination with virtual reality or just a passing interest, here's a look at the best budget VR headsets available right now.

##### Meta Quest 2

Best Overall

 Fantastic all-in-one headset with an equally awesome price

 $199$250 Save $51

 The Meta Quest 2 is a surprisingly powerful all-in-one VR headset with two equally impressive controllers. It features a sharp display with a high refresh rate.

**Pros**

* All-in-one VR headset; no cables required
* Controllers have straps
* Really good library of games (and growing)
* Excellent motion tracking
* 128GB and 256GB storage options available

**Cons**

* Battery life is OK

[$199 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004128&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-vr-headsets%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$300 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmeta-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F6473553.p%3FskuId%3D6473553)

 Who says you need a powerful PC or even a console to enjoy VR? With the Meta Quest 2, you'll be able to access a growing library of VR games at a resolution that isn't a blurry mess. This VR headset is the complete package—no external hardware is needed.

 That's because the Meta Quest 2 features an impressive processor, two incredibly responsive controllers with haptic feedback, and a high-resolution display running at up to a 120Hz refresh rate.

 The best part is that the Meta Quest 2 is completely independent of a PC and a tether, so you won't get tangled accidentally. Instead, you create boundaries while wearing the headset, and if you come near it, you'll come in virtual contact with a barrier.

##### VR Empire Headset

Best Value

 Comfy VR headset for casual entertainment

 The VR Empire Headset is a sturdy device with a nice mix of comfort and function, like breathable foam and built-in headphones. It’s perfect for kicking back with a movie or TV show.

**Pros**

* Comfortable
* Broad compatibility
* Delivers impressive sounds with the built-in headphone
* Adjustable focal and pupil distance

**Cons**

* Not ideal for users who wear glasses

[$42 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N3WJLGB?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004128&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-vr-headsets%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$40 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/VR-Headset-Android-Phone-iPhoe-Controller-120-FOV-3-5mm-Audio-Wireless-Adaptor-Anti-Blue-Light-Lenses-Fits-All-Mobile-s-Length-Display-Size-Up-6-7-7-/402223189)

 Functionality, comfort, and durability score high in the VR Empire Headset, making it a suitable pick for anyone who’s on a shoestring budget. Its 120-degree field-of-view is impressive, allowing you to view lifelike and sizeable images in your videos and games.

 The comfort level is admirable since the headset has breathable foam that sits on the face without irritating the skin. You can also use the adjustable straps to find the perfect pick for maximum enjoyment. It includes well-performing headphones which enhance the audio quality for complete immersion. Although the included remote control isn’t for gaming purposes, it’s a great addition and lets you control the volume and pause/play whatever you’re watching.

 You’ll appreciate the anti-blue light filter that protects your eyes from harmful blue light emitted by the screen. The two rotary knobs on the sides enable you to align and adjust the pupil distance to eliminate blurry images.

##### Sony PlayStation VR2

Best for PS5

Now your PS5 can do VR!

 The PSVR2 is the most powerful companion for the PS5 given its 4K resolution, HDR, and 120Hz refresh rate. The motion controllers even feature Sony's DualSense adaptive triggers for extra immersion

**Pros**

* Leaps and bounds ahead of the original PSVR in performance and design
* Controllers have built-in haptic feedback and adaptive triggers
* 4K OLED panels with HDR
* 120Hz refresh rate
* 110-degree FOV

**Cons**

* Limited to the PlayStation 5

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR2-PSVR2-5/dp/B0C1QJ6VHY/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004128&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-budget-vr-headsets%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$550 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-VR2-Headset/3586747159?athbdg=L1103) [$550 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fplaystation-vr2%2F6542114.p%3FskuId%3D6542114)

 It's no secret that the PlayStation 5 is among the most powerful consoles of the current generation, but the PSVR2 takes what's already there and turns your PS5 into a dedicated VR setup. While the original PSVR felt more like a test, Sony really leaned into it this time around.

 For starters, the PSVR2 headset is drastically more powerful, thanks to the PS5's internal hardware. The original PSVR was limited to 1080p, whereas the PSVR2 can go all the way to 4K and at a 120Hz refresh rate. It'll look incredibly sharp and smooth, especially when you throw in its HDR support for better colors.

 What's arguably the stars of the show are the adaptive triggers. Sony took their revolutionary technology (used in the PS5 DualSense controller) and slipped it into the PSVR2\. In addition to being accurate, the adaptive triggers add a subtle level of immersion you can't find anywhere else.

 The BNEXT VR Headset has outstanding features despite being a budget-level headset.

 The Pansonite VR Headset offers incredible features at a great price. It’s a popular choice among people who enjoy gaming and watching.

## Choosing the Best Budget VR Headset

 What matters most in choosing the right VR headset is understanding what you want out of the device. Is your aim to add a whole new level of entertainment to your home or just a fun oddity occasionally? In answering that question, you'll fall into one of two camps.

 On one hand, the Meta Quest 2 is by far the best budget VR headset around. Not only is it a powerful device for its size, it works completely independently of a PC and can access a robust VR library. In fact, you can tether it to a PC to access even more games!

 On the other hand, if you're looking for simple yet effective immersion, the VR Empire Headset is a fine alternative. You get a nice mix of comfort and functionality, like the breathable foam, the controller, and its compatibility with larger smartphones up to 7.3 inches.
