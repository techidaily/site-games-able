## Best SSD for PS5 Overall: WD_BLACK SN850X
![The WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD on a desktop PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wd_black-sn850x-nvme-ssd.jpg)

_Western Digital_

 The [WD_BLACK SN850X](https://www.amazon.com/WD-BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Heatsink-dp-B0B7CPSN2K/dp/B0B7CPSN2K?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a high-end M.2 SSD that replaces its popular SN850\. It brings excellent upgrades over its predecessor, including faster sequential performance and a new 4TB capacity model. It's also one of the few M.2 drives that support [Microsoft DirectStorage](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-microsoft-directstorage-how-does-it-make-gaming-faster/) for compatible PC games.

 The SN850X boasts blistering read speeds of up to 7,300MB/s, exceeding Sony's 5,500MB/s speed requirements. It not only delivers similar gaming performance to the PS5's built-in SSD but also remains a solid choice for handling future demanding games. Throw in the low-profile heatsink and Western Digital's excellent thermal management, and you get the perfect SSD for your PS5 console.

 The WD\_BLACK SN850X strikes a good balance between performance and price. While not the cheapest drive, it offers future-proof performance for the PS5 with blistering speeds up to 7,300MB/s, and the built-in heatsink keeps everything cool during intense gaming sessions.

**Pros**

## Best Budget SSD for PS5: Crucial P3 Plus
![The Crucial P3 Plus NVMe SSD on a laptop's keyboard.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crucial-p3-plus-nvme-ssd.jpg)

_Crucial_

[PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-m2-ssd-gaming/) tend to be expensive, but the good thing is that you don't need a 7,000MB/s SSD to fully leverage the capabilities of the PS5\. The budget-friendly [Crucial P3 Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Plus-PCIe-NAND-5000MB/dp/B0B25NXWC7?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) , capable of up to 5,000MB/s sequential read speeds, delivers strong gaming performance on the PS5 on par with premium, more expensive M.2 drives.

 The only downside with this M.2 SSD is the missing heatsink. Even that is not a dealbreaker since you can pair it with a reasonably priced third-party heatsink like the [MHQJRH M.2 2280 SSD heatsink](https://www.amazon.com/MHQJRH-heatsink-Double-Sided-Thermal-Silicone/dp/B07KDDKDNN?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) , and the total cost will still be lower than most PS5-compatible SSDs. The Crucial P3 Plus is available in four capacity options, from 500GB to 4TB.

_SAMSUNG_

 Samsung is no stranger when it comes to high-quality storage solutions, offering some of the [best portable SSDs](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-portable-ssds/) the market has to offer. The [Samsung 980 PRO with Heatsink](https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P1T0CW/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is one of the fastest and most reliable M.2 SSDs you can pair with the PS5\. It has outstanding performance, and it plays well with the PS5 internal storage and PlayStation OS, allowing you to smoothly transfer games and apps to and from the internal SSD and launch games faster without any issues.

 Samsung designed the heatsink to fit perfectly in the PS5 SSD bay. At just 8.6mm thicker, it's well below the 11.25mm maximum thickness allowed by the PS5, which means you can install this drive with its heatsink and safely close all the panels without any issues. Add to that Samsung's renowned thermal design and optimization, and you get a PS5 SSD that can handle extended periods of play without any performance drops.

_Corsair_

 Craving even more PS5 game storage? Corsair offers one of the largest-capacity SSDs officially compatible with the console, reaching a whopping 8TB. The [MP600 PRO LPX](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B0CJRN3LLX?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) boasts blazing-fast speeds (up to 7,100MB/s reads) for near-instant game loading and silky-smooth performance. Plus, its integrated heatsink keeps things cool even during intense gaming sessions.

 While not the most budget-friendly option, the MP600 PRO LPX's price per gigabyte becomes increasingly attractive at higher capacities, making the 8TB model a compelling choice for hardcore gamers. The MP600 PRO LPX also comes in a sleek white finish and smaller capacities up to 500GB.

It meets Sony's speed requirements, delivering up to 7,300MB/s reads, but where it truly shines is its thermal performance. The robust heatsink, featuring unique gill-like ventilation, keeps the drive cool even during intense sessions, ensuring sustained performance and reliability.

 Despite its beefy heatsink, the XS70 seamlessly fits into the PS5's expansion slot, adding up to 4TB of storage. Plus, it boasts a competitive price point, especially for the 4TB version, making it a budget-friendly powerhouse. Silicon Power also offers the XS70 in an 8TB variant, but it's often out of stock. If you need higher capacity, the [8TB Corsair MP600 PRO LPX](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B0CJRN3LLX?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a nice alternative.

## FAQ

### Q: What does SSD stand for?

 SSD stands for Solid-State Drive, a type of data storage device that stores data on interconnected flash memory chips, making it much faster, more durable, and quieter than HDDs, which use spinning platters and a moving head.

### Q: What type of SSD does the PS5 use?

 The PS5 uses any compatible PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s for internal storage expansion. While you can also connect an external USB drive to the PS5, it can only be used to play PS4 games and media apps, not PS5 games.

### Q: What is the maximum size SSD that the PS5 can use?

 The PS5 now supports up to 8TB SSDs for internal storage expansion, thanks to a system firmware update released in September 2023\. The [Corsair MP600 PRO LPX](https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B0CJRN3LLX?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a solid option for a PS5-compatible 8TB SSD.

### Q: Do I need a heatsink on my PS5 SSD?

 Yes, Sony recommends using a heatsink for effective heat dissipation, especially with high-performance SSDs or intense gaming sessions. Most M.2 drives come with a heatsink, but you can also snag an affordable M.2 drive and pair it with a PS5-compatible heatsink, like the [MHQJRH M.2 2280 SSD heatsink](https://www.amazon.com/MHQJRH-heatsink-Double-Sided-Thermal-Silicone/dp/B07KDDKDNN?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009707&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ssd-for-ps5%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) , for a budget-friendly upgrade.

### Q: How do I install an SSD into my PS5?

 Installing an SSD on your PS5 is a fairly straightforward process that involves removing the back cover of your console to expose the M.2 drive bay. To avoid damaging your console or the SSD, follow our step-by-step guide to [installing an M.2 SSD on your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-m2-ssd-ps5-guide/) .
