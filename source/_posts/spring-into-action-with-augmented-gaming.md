## Spring Into Action with Augmented Gaming

### Key Takeaways

* Spend more time outdoors for a happier and healthier life. AR mobile games like Jurassic World Alive, ZRX, and Pokémon GO make it fun to get outside and enjoy nature.
* Jurassic World Alive lets you explore your neighborhood to discover and collect your favorite dinosaurs. ZRX is a fitness app that uses interactive stories to track your run. Pokémon GO lets you become a Pokémon trainer and capture Pokémon while exploring your surroundings.
* Draconius GO is similar to Pokémon GO but focuses on capturing mythical creatures like dragons. Use Star Walk 2 to learn about the stars at night. Ingress Prime combines real-world exploration with a science-fiction story. Orna is a unique AR game with old RPG elements. Pikmin Bloom is a cute AR game where you gather seedlings while walking outdoors.

 If you want to live a happier and healthier life, then you should make an effort to spend more time outdoors. Not only does time outside mean you can breathe in some fresh air, but it can offer excellent benefits such as decreased stress levels, improved sleep, and an energy boost.

 Although there are plenty of reasons to spend time in natural outdoor settings, for some it is easier said than done. These fun AR (augmented reality) mobile games merge the real world with the virtual one to offer some get-up-and-go when it comes to spending time outside in nature!

## 1\. Jurassic World Alive

 Jurassic World Alive is the perfect mobile game if you're a dino lover and even more so if you're a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise because you can explore your neighborhood to discover all your favorite dinosaurs from the movies.

 The game requires you to actually walk around on the map to collect different dinosaurs and have them compete in ferocious PvP battles. Moreover, you can even create your own unique dinosaur breeds using the in-game laboratory and the DNA you've accumulated.

**Download:** Jurassic World Alive for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1231085864?mt=8) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludia.jw2) (Free, in-app purchases and subscription available)

Close

 ZRX is the only app on this list that is actually dedicated to fitness. Essentially, the app allows you to select an interactive story and choose how to track your run, and as you move so does the story.

 Possibly the most well-known storyline is Zombies, Run! But [what is Zombies, Run all about](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-zombies-run-app/) ? Zombies, Run is a [beginner-friendly running app](https://www.makeuseof.com/ranking-best-running-apps-beginners/) that encourages you to get moving using scare tactics. Essentially, you have to survive the zombie epidemic while doing a variety of dangerous missions.

 Alternatively, there is also a [5K training app](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-couch-to-5k-apps-train-fitness-race/) from Zombies, Run! team to help you train for the next big race.

Close

 It is not possible to mention AR mobile games without bringing up Pokémon GO. After becoming wildly popular at launch, Pokémon GO remains a legendary AR game where you can live out your dream as a Pokémon trainer.

 The game is not difficult to play: simply walk around and explore your actual physical surroundings to capture different Pokémon. As you play you'll be able to level up as a trainer as well as power up and evolve your Pokémon.

 Additionally, you can get your 10,000 steps in as you walk around your area looking for Gyms where you can join teams and put your Pokémon to the test against others.

**Download:** Pokémon GO for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 4\. Draconius GO

![Draconius GO augmented reality mobile game berrydillo](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/draconius-go-berrydillo.jpg)

Close

 Draconius GO is basically the same as Pokémon Go, but it is better suited for those who want to find and capture majestic dragons and other mythical creatures as they get active outdoors.

 The objective of the game is straightforward—go outside to explore the map and find eggs to collect and hatch. Who knows, you might find anything from a rare, winged Basilisk to an adorable Berrydillo.

 As you play you can level up, learn awesome spells, collect magical objects, and even take part in dragon battles. So, not only can Draconius GO get you motivated to spend time outdoors, but it can also help you [make friends in your community](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-social-media-apps-for-making-friends/) .

## 5\. Star Walk 2

Close

 Stepping outdoors is not only limited to daylight hours. Spending some time outside at nighttime is also beneficial for your physical and mental well-being. Use the Star Walk 2 app to embrace the dark and learn more about the stars above you in the night sky.

 Star Walk 2 is a stunning mobile app that is easy to use with a clear premise. In simple terms, the idea is to aim your mobile phone towards the sky to find constellations, planets, stars, satellites, and so much more. You can then tap on the images in space to view 3D models or to learn more information.

**Download:** Star Walk 2 for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/star-walk-2-ads-sky-tracker/id1112481571) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitotechnology.StarWalk2Free) (Free, in-app purchases and subscription available)

## 6\. Ingress Prime

![Ingress Prime augmented reality mobile game missions](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ingress-missions.jpg)

Close

 Just like the majority of AR mobile games, in order to play Ingress Prime you have to walk around and explore the real-world map and different locations. That makes it a perfect way to enjoy some fresh air outside and get moving. But with portals, XM particles, and various high-tech weapons, Ingress Prime is the ultimate game for those who love a good science fiction story.

 To begin playing Ingress Prime you have to first choose a faction—The Enlightened or The Resistance. Once you've selected a side, you can collect XM to power your actions throughout the game, take part in fun missions in your local area, or hack portals to collect more items.

**Download:** Ingress Prime for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ingress-prime/id576505181) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress) (Free, in-app purchases and subscription available)

## 7\. Orna
![Orna The Adventure GPS RPG](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/orna-world.jpg)

![Orna The Adventure GPS RPG battle](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/orna-battle.jpg)

Close

 If you're looking for an AR mobile game that is unlike any other, then you need to try Orna. While it is similar to other AR games because you have to move in real life to move in the in-game world map, what makes Orna unique is that it is based on old, classic-style RPG adventure games.

 The game offers over 50 character classes to choose from whether you want to play as a sorcerer, a druid, or a thief. Build up your weapons, spells, and defense to beat other players in the world around you, and then collect experience and new items. Even better, you can take part in a range of enchanting events and quests.

**Download:** Orna for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/orna-turn-based-gps-rpg/id1451775309) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=playorna.com.orna) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 8\. Pikmin Bloom
![Pikmin Bloom augmented reality mobile game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pikmin-bloom.jpg)

![Pikmin Bloom augmented reality mobile game map](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pikmin-bloom-map.jpg)

![Pikmin Bloom augmented reality mobile game seedlings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pikmin-bloom-seeds.jpg)

Close

 Not only is Pikmin Bloom a super cute AR mobile game, but it is relaxing, too. The game works using a step counter or GPS tracking on your phone and the basis is to gather seedlings, bloom flowers, and lots more.

 Each Pikmin creature is a blend of an animal and a plant which makes them incredibly cute and also fun to collect. The trick is that you need to keep moving to grow your seedlings. So the more time you spend walking around outdoors, the more adorable Pikmin you can pluck and have to walk around with you.

**Download:** Pikmin Bloom for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/pikmin-bloom/id1556357398) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pikmin) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## Outdoor Virtual and Real-Life Adventures Using the Power of AR

 You might only know about augmented reality mobile games because of Pokémon GO. Yet, there is a wide variety of AR games that combine virtual and real-world maps to create an amazing gaming experience.

 Besides being fun, AR mobile games are also great if you want to get moving outdoors, especially if you're someone who lacks the motivation or who doesn't like to unplug. So, whether you're catching dinosaurs and dragons, running from zombies, or exploring the night sky, these AR games can provide some entertainment while you step out into real life.
