## What You Need to Know About Audio Accessibility on Xbox

 Before going into how you can access and enable audio accessibility settings on your Xbox Series X|S, there are a few key features of some of the settings you need to know about. These key features can be defined by the following:

* Altering the**Mono output** setting will reset all of your**Volume & audio output** settings, so you need to ensure you are able to reverse any changes if you then wish to remove**Mono output** .
* Enabling**Mute notification sounds** may reduce the noise pollution of your Xbox, but it may make noticing any important notifications harder than it needs to be, depending on your needs.
* All other options, including**Mute navigation sounds** ,**Power chime** , and**Mute start-up sounds** , can be turned on and off with little effect on other aspects of your Xbox.

 If you enable**Mute notification sounds** , for instance, it may make it harder for you to acknowledge useful messages from Xbox, like when you can[save money through your Xbox wish list](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-manage-wish-list/) .
