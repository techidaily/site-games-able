* Enabling**Mute notification sounds** may reduce the noise pollution of your Xbox, but it may make noticing any important notifications harder than it needs to be, depending on your needs.
* All other options, including**Mute navigation sounds** ,**Power chime** , and**Mute start-up sounds** , can be turned on and off with little effect on other aspects of your Xbox.
