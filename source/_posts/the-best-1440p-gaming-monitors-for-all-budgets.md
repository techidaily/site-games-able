## The Best 1440P Gaming Monitors for All Budgets

 There’s no doubting the wondrous experience of gaming on a 4K monitor or TV, but not everyone wants to make that leap. Some say it’s too much, others don’t have or don’t want to fork out enough to cover the price of admission for 4K. But if you’re hoping to leap past 1080p resolution, it should be with 1440p.

 Otherwise known as 2K, 1440p resolution is a great in-between. It may not be as sharp as 4K, but it’s exceedingly better than 1080p. There are more pixels to count and a much higher pixel density. More importantly, there are a plethora of options when it comes to 1440p monitors, from top-of-the-line premium specs to entry-level budget displays.

Here are the best 1440p gaming monitors available today.

## Our Favorite 1440p Gaming Monitors in 2023

![GIGABYTE-M27Q](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GIGABYTE-M27Q.jpg)

Best Overall

##### GIGABYTE M27Q

 Well-rounded monitor with a high refresh rate

 $250$300 Save $50

 The GIGABYTE M27Q embodies all the right features for gaming. It uses an IPS display for better viewing angles, a super-fast response time, and a 170Hz refresh rate for smooth transitioning.

**Pros**

* FreeSync reduces screen tearing
* HDR400 with 92 percent DCI-P3 color gamut
* Fantastic viewing angles
* 0.5ms MPRT response time

**Cons**

* Can't pivot screen

[$250 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JWCHR5N?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002430&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-1440p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$300 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-m27q-27-led-qhd-freesync-premium-ips-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-hdmi-displayport-usb-black%2F6438287.p%3FskuId%3D6438287)

 The GIGABYTE M27Q is an outstanding affordable 1440p gaming monitor, especially if you're looking for wider viewing angles. With its IPS panel, you have a wider range of mobility as far as monitor placement is concerned, which pairs nicely with the stand's height and tilt adjustment. However, that’s a minor positive compared to this display's performance.

 Its 1440p resolution looks beautiful and sharp with the addition of HDR400 and 92 percent DCI-P3 color gamut. On the competitive side, its more impressive specification is the 170Hz refresh rate, alongside AMD FreeSync to keep screen tearing to a minimum.

 Equally impressive is its 0.5ms MPRT response time, which helps reduce the overall effect of blurring. If you're a competitive gamer that doesn't want to splash all their cash on a monitor, this is a happy middle ground.

##### ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q

A fine mix of performance and style

 $256$399 Save $143

 The ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q is a 1440p gaming monitor with a fast response time, G-Sync, and anti-blur technology. It also boasts a speedy 175Hz refresh rate for smooth gameplay.

**Pros**

* AMD hardware benefits from VRR technology

* G-Sync compatibility

**Cons**

* VRR compatibility with AMD isn't advertised
* Contrast ratio is average

[$256 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GL66PK4?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002430&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-1440p-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$550 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-asus-rog-swift-pg329q-32%2Fp%2FN82E16824281090)

 When you want all the goodies in a 1440p monitor, it’s hard to argue against the ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q. For starters, it has a nice 32-inch screen, giving you quite a premium viewing experience. More importantly, it has a long list of features gamers around the world go for. Having a 60Hz refresh rate is fine, but the PG329Q supports as high as 175Hz.

 With enough power in your PC, that can offer a very smooth frame transition. And with its built-in G-Sync and ELMB Sync, you won’t have to worry about screen tearing and motion blur artifacts as much, since it can sync your PC’s refresh rate on the fly.

 Lastly, its response time measures as low as 1ms, making it an excellent choice for competitive gaming.

 For gamers looking to gain entry into 1440p gaming as fast as possible, the Acer V277U is a great option. Not only is the price tag easy on the wallet, but it’s also packing the bare minimum features needed to enjoy a 1440p resolution. At 27 inches, the Acer V277U is right at the sweet spot to display a 1440p resolution without stretching the pixels past their limit.

 Additionally, its stand has a small footprint and won’t take up too much space on your desk., though it only tilts up and down. Thankfully, it can be wall-mounted via VESA mounting.

 You’ll get a slightly above-average refresh rate of 75Hz, with Adaptive Sync to keep it smooth. Accompanying that is a 4ms response time and a solid picture quality to display the latest games. Together those make for a good experience for casual gamers.

 After you've picked up better hardware, and increased the size of the screen and the resolution, how else are you supposed to improve your gaming experience? You focus on color, and the Alienware AW3423DW has no shortage of color.

 If you're a color snob, the Alienware AW3423DW's quantum dot display will certainly impress. You're bringing rich, cinematic colors to your games, along with a contrast ratio that looks truly black without sucking detail out or causing vibrant colors to bloom.

 The Alienware AW3423DW takes up a lot of desk real estate, though you do have the option to adjust height, tilt, and swivel. That's great and all, but something like this should be mounted. Thankfully, the monitor supports VESA wall mounts—in fact, it's packaged with one, taking out all the guesswork on finding the right mount.

 A suitable option for working and gaming

 $236$300 Save $64

 The Dell S2722DGM strikes the perfect balance between work and play. During the day, color gamut coverage is ideal for color-sensitive work. At night, its fast response time and high refresh rate make gaming feel smooth.

**Pros**

* Features DisplayPort and 2 HDMI ports
* Great color and contrast ratio
* 165Hz refresh rate
* Fast response time

**Cons**

 Dell has a good track record when it comes to designing monitors with great color accuracy and coverage for professional work, and the Dell S2722DGM is no different. While it'll impress you with its colors, it'll be just as impressive for when you're ready to relax with your favorite videogame.

 Starting with its beautiful color expression, the Dell S2722DGM covers 99% of the sRGB color gamut, which pairs wonderfully with its 3000:1 contrast ratio. In other words, colors are going to really pop, especially when a scene features dark shadows.

 When it's time to game, you're going to love its surprisingly fast response time of 1ms, which is well within range for competitive play. Most importantly, its refresh rate is an impressive 165Hz if you use the DisplayPort. If you opt to use HDMI, it's slightly lower at 144Hz, which is still great!

 No-nonsense monitor with a curve and adaptive sync

**Pros**

* Supports adaptive sync
* Several size options and resolutions
* 165Hz refresh rate
* Good color gamut

 Curved monitors can really enhance your gaming experience, but it tends to come with a price hike that doesn't quite justify the purchase. The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Curved Monitor sets things right, and it comes with a suite of gaming features, too!

 First off, the Pixio PXC277's screen measures 27 inches, which is a great sweet spot for a 1440p resolution since it doesn't stretch the pixels past their limit. If that's not quite big enough, there's a 32-inch option that still retains the sharpness of its resolution and curvature.

 It's not all curves and resolution, though. The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Monitor boasts adaptive sync that works for both AMD and GPU graphics cards to ensure your framerate stays buttery smooth while you're gaming.

 The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Monitor is a shortcut to a large, curved display with 1440p resolution.

## Picking the Best 1440p Gaming Monitor For You

 With resolution already accounted for, finding the right 1440p gaming monitor comes down to refresh rate, response time, and VRR technology, like FreeSync (AMD) and G-Sync (NVIDIA). All three work together to make gameplay feel exponentially smoother and can mean the difference between life and death and competitive games.

 The GIGABYTE M27Q his the trifecta: an incredibly fast response time, a high refresh rate of 170Hz, and VRR availability for both AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. With an IPS display to boot, you'll be able to kick back and relax with your favorite videogame without losing picture quality.

 However, if you want the quickest route to 1440p gaming, the Acer V277U is a superb second option. Its display is a healthy 27 inches, which combines really well with the resolution. More importantly, it has a 75Hz refresh rate and adaptive sync technology to smooth frame transitioning.
