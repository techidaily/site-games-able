## Modify Steam Interface Language

 As the most popular gaming platform, Steam lets users from different parts of the world change the default language.

 Maybe you want to change Steam’s language so you can navigate and interact with the platform more efficiently. Or you want to practice a foreign language, and you want to incorporate Steam games into the language learning routine. At the time of writing, Steam has official support for 29 languages across many platform features, so there's a chance you can find the one that you want.

 No matter the reason, you can change Steam’s default language by going through the steps below.

## How to Change Steam's Language on Desktop

 Despite being the most popular gaming platform, Steam will run into the occasional issue. When this happens, it helps to change the Steam language, so you can better understand the issue and fix it faster.

 If [you’re having trouble playing Steam games](https://www.makeuseof.com/troubleshoot-windows-steam-games-not-playing/) , here’s how you can change its language before fixing the issue:

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Open the Steam menu from the top-left corner and select**Settings** .
3. From the left pane, click**Interface** .
4. Open the drop-down menu below**Select the language you wish Steam to use** and select a new language.
5. Click**OK** . Steam will now inform you that you have to restart the app for the changes to take place.
6. Click**Restart Steam** , and you’ll enjoy the app in your preferred language.

## How to Change Steam’s Language Online

 Steam will not sync the change across multiple platforms. However, changing the language on Steam for the web is a straightforward process. Click your username and go to**Choose language** . There, select the option that suits your preferences.

 Now, if you need more control over the language settings, you’ll have to sign in. Then, click your username and go to**Preferences** . There, open the**Language Preferences** menu.

 Use the**Primary section** to select your preferred language. If your preferred language isn’t that common among game developers, it’s better to choose one of the options from the**Secondary language** section.

 This way, you’ll still have store page descriptions or user reviews displayed in a language that you understand or want to learn.

## How to Change Steam Language on Mobile

 If you don’t want to miss Steam's best deals, or you want to keep up with the gaming community news, chances are you’re using the Steam mobile app. In this case, here’s how you can change the language on the Steam mobile app:

1. Launch Steam.
2. Tap the**hamburger menu** from the bottom-right corner.
3. Head to**Settings** .
4. Open the menu next to**Language** .
5. Select a new option. The change should be instantaneous, without you having to restart the app.

## How to Change Steam Language for a Specific Game

 If you share your Steam account with other people, it might make sense to change the default language for individual games. To do so, right-click the game you want to change the language for and select**Properties** . Then, in the**General** tab, use the drop-down menu next to**Language** to select your preferred option.

 Now, there’s a chance that you can’t find the wanted language. You can check the game’s Steam page to find out which languages are offered. If you don’t want anyone to change your language settings for that game, you can [hide the game from your Steam library](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-hide-steam-activity/) .

## Change Steam Language With Ease

 Now you know how to change the default language on Steam for desktop, web, mobile apps, and individual games. The process is quite simple, and you can undo the change, if you change your mind.
