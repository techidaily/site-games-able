## Strategies to Expand Your Digital Gaming Library on Steam

 Adding funds to your Steam wallet might prove to be a little tricky if you’re new to the platform, but we’ll show you how to do so and then buy games.

 There are many benefits to owning an active Steam account. At the forefront of these is that you can own games without going to a physical game store.

## 1\. Add a Debit or Credit Card to Your Steam Account

 Debit or credit cards are the primary way you should buy games on Steam. It’s easy to block them outside of Steam; you can place a fixed amount on them to budget for your gaming, and they offer many more advantages.

Here’s how to add a card to your Steam account:

1. Launch**Steam** , sign in, and click your username in the top-right corner of the window.  
![User menu on steam with Account details highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/user-menu-on-steam-with-account-details-highlighted.jpg)
2. Choose**Account details** on the menu.
3. Select**Add a payment method to this account** from the**Store $ Purchase History** section.  
![Store & Purchase History section in Steam preferences](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/store-purchase-history-section-in-steam-preferences.jpeg)
4. In the resulting window, select your card type (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, or JCB). Steam only supports the options there, and, by default, it's on**Visa** .

5. Enter your card number, expiration date, and security code (CVV).
6. Scroll lower to the**Billing Information** section and add your details. Make sure to add the details attached to that card—even if it’s different from your current name and address.
7. Click**Continue** to finish.

 If you run into any errors while adding your card, re-confirm the card number, expiration date, CVV, and billing information. If it persists, make sure you have at least $1 on the card you want to add.

## 2\. Add Steam Funds With a Card or PayPal

 Adding funds to your wallet is the primary and default way to make payments on Steam. Even after adding a payment method, Steam will attempt to debit your wallet first when making game purchases.

 Additionally, you can use PayPal to fund your Steam account. So, if you don’t want to or can’t use your debit/credit card, you can still make purchases on Steam.

Here’s how to fund your account:

1. Launch**Steam** and click your name in the top-right corner.
2. Click**Account details** and navigate to the**Store & Purchase History** section.
3. Choose**\+ Add funds to your Steam wallet** .
4. Steam will present a menu of funds you can add. The minimum is $5, and the maximum is $100 (at a single time).
5. Select**Add funds** on the tier you want.  
![Adding funds to your Steam wallet menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adding-funds-to-your-steam-wallet-menu.jpg)
6. A review window will appear where you can change your payment method.

8. Tick the Steam Subscriber Agreement box and click**Purchase** .

 If credit/debit cards or PayPal don’t work for you on Steam, try buying Steam gift cards on third-party websites. After you get them,[redeem the Steam wallet codes](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-redeem-steam-wallet-codes-and-gift-cards/) to fund your account.
