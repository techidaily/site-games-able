## Seamless Social Gaming: Essential Cross-Platform Titles

 If you and your friends can't agree on whether Android or iOS is better for mobile gaming, don't worry. There's actually no need to choose between them because everyone can play cross-platform games on both operating systems.

 So, the next time you're looking for multiplayer games to play with friends, try the cross-platform mobile titles below.

## 1\. Spaceteam

 Spaceteam is the one game on this list that requires all your friends to be in the same physical space.

 In Spaceteam, you and your friends are the crew of a spaceship, and everything's going wrong. To stay on course, you'll need to work together by shouting different made-up space commands to each other. The speed and the chaos ramp up and up until you all inevitably crash and die, only to be awarded medals posthumously. But it's fun while it lasts.

 If you have a smaller friend group, you can also try out the[best two-player mobile games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-two-player-mobile-games/) .

**Download:** Spaceteam for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/spaceteam/id570510529) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sleepingbeastgames.spaceteam) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 2\. Words With Friends 2

The sequel to the acclaimed Words With Friends is more like an update.

 Of course, there's the regular Words With Friends experience that you're used to, where you and a friend or online stranger take turns trying to rack up points on a board by spelling out words Scrabble-style.

 However, while Words With Friends 2 keeps everything you loved about the first version, it adds a few new modes for a different challenge.

 Lightning Round pits two teams of five against each other to see who can come up with a certain score in the fastest time. Solo Challenge lets you play against challenging bots to win a virtual prize. Finally, Words With Friends Live drops in with HQ Trivia-style questions during your game.

## 3\. Pokémon UNITE

 A MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) similar to League of Legends, Pokémon UNITE offers more fast-paced, streamlined gameplay for quick on-demand teamwork battles.

 Choose from one of over 40 Pokémon and go head-to-head against another team in Unite Battles in order to score more points before the time runs out. Travel across the map to battle wild Pokémon, gather energy and experience, and work together as a team while inviting your friends along.

## 4\. Teamfight Tactics

 Riot Games' auto chess title provides a competitive experience with familiar League of Legends' champions. Draft and play champions while aiming to create the best team.

 With full cross-platform support, play normal or ranked matches with your friends as you learn the best synergies and items that work together. It's also one of the best multiplayer PvP games for both mobile and PC!

## 5\. Minecraft

 Originally referred to as the Pocket Edition, the mobile version of Minecraft is almost identical to the PC version. The only significant difference is that you can't connect third-party mods or use third-party servers. Also, typically, any update that comes out for Minecraft won't come out for the mobile versions until a later date.

 That said, the mobile version is a wonderful way to experience Minecraft on the go.

 Playing Minecraft alone, however, is no fun. No matter the platform, Minecraft was made for socializing, and its cross-compatibility lets you play with your friends. If Minecraft doesn't sate your adventuring itch or allow for enough relaxing world-building, you can try out these[serene gaming apps to help reduce feelings of anxiety and stress](https://www.makeuseof.com/serene-gaming-apps-reduce-anxiety-stress/) .

**Download:** Minecraft for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/minecraft/id479516143) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe) ($6.99 \[iOS\], $6.99 \[Android\], in-app purchases available)

## 6\. Hearthstone

 Real-life trading card games are fun, but online trading card games let you do things like summon demons and blow up your booster packs.

 Hearthstone, developed by Blizzard and set in the world of Warcraft, is a strategy game that lets you collect cards, build decks, and duel your friends. It's free to play, but you can buy new card packs to give yourself that extra edge.

 With periodic expansions, tournaments, and challenges, there's always a reason to get back into Hearthstone. Play your friends in the Arena or battle strangers to increase your Rank.

**Download:** Hearthstone for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/hearthstone/id625257520) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 7\. Pokémon Go

 When it debuted, Pokémon Go smashed the glass ceiling for AR (Augmented Reality) gaming, bringing pocket monsters into the real world. You and your friends can take your phones, whether Android or iOS, and go out into the real world and explore.

**Download:** Pokémon Go for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 8\. PUBG Mobile

 The world's classic battle royale game is available on pretty much any platform you can think of, including iOS and Android.

 While the mobile version of Fortnite also scratches this itch, accessing Fortnite on Android and iOS requires additional steps for a mixed-platform team-up. Comparatively, PUBG Mobile offers a straightforward download for both Android and iOS devices. But if you're looking for an equally robust, event-ready competitor, PUBG Mobile definitely offers this.

 Plus, with its typically sub-30-minute match time, it's one of the easier phone games to play with your friends online.

**Download:** PUBG Mobile for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/pubg-mobile-arcane/id1330123889) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig) (Free, in-app purchases available)

## 9\. Mario Kart Tour

 While many cross-platform mobile multiplayer games focus on a more typical battle game archetype, the racing sub-genre shouldn't be forgotten. While Mario Kart remains a strong option on the Nintendo Switch, your friends on mobile don't need to be left out.

 While single player mode is fun on its own, Mario Kart offers both a race or battle multiplayer mode. It's a simple matter to create a room for your friends and set-up either a race or battle. Plus, you can set up a room code if you want to keep your multiplayer experience private.

 Plus, if Mario Kart Tour triggers your nostalgia itch, you're not limited to Mario games with friends. There's even a convenient way to[play classic Super Mario games on Android devices](https://www.makeuseof.com/play-classic-mario-games-android/) .

## 10\. Old School RuneScape

 Ready to scratch the nostalgia bug with friends? As one of the earliest accessible MMORPGs, many gamers will fondly remember RuneScape. Whether you're ready to fish, mine, or fight, you can resume your adventures in true crossplay form with all of your friends.

## 11\. League of Legends: Wild Rift

 If you've been a fan of Riot Games' League of Legends franchise, taking to the Rift with friends on mobile was previously impossible. While League of Legends: Wild Rift doesn't support crossplay with PC players, Android and iOS users can queue up in duos, trios, or a complete five-person party as you target the enemy's nexus. With Riot's MOBA mobile launch, you can now play a full phone game with your friends.

**Download:** League of Legends: Wild Rift for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riotgames.league.wildrift) (Free, in-app purchases available)
