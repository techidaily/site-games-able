## Steering Clear of No Signal in Pokémon GO

 Pokémon GO allows you to see Pokémon and Gyms around you in real-time, so you can defeat or catch them to complete your Pokédex. But the app completely relies on your GPS location to work. If your Pokémon GO app is showing the GPS Signal Not Found (11) error, your game is rendered totally unplayable.

 But don’t rush out to get a new phone to continue your Pokémon adventure! Your mobile device itself is probably not causing this error. If your Pokémon GO app is showing the GPS Signal Not Found (11) error, here is how you can fix it.

## Why Can't Pokémon GO Find My Location?

 Pokémon GO is one of the most popular picks of all the [Pokémon companion apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-pokemon-companion-apps/) out there. And like anything else, it can be frustrating when it's not working properly. Thankfully, there are a few tricks you can use to kick the app back into action.

 There are several reasons why your phone may be unable to find your location. Here are the most common reasons:

* Your location services may be turned off.
* The app may not have permission to use your location services.
* You might not be connected to the internet.
* You may be in a location that is hard to track.
* You may need to reboot your location settings.

 There is a chance that the GPS in your mobile device may be faulty, but nine times out of 10, the issue will lie in your mobile device’s settings.

## How Do I Fix the Pokémon GO GPS Signal Not Found Error?

 If you've already tried the golden rule of troubleshooting to no avail, which is, of course, turning your device off and back on again, and you're sure your device is connected to the internet, you can try any of the below methods to fix your GPS woes.

### Make Sure Your Location Services Are Switched On

 One of the first things you should check when trying to fix the GPS Signal Not Found (11) error is that your location services are switched on. Your device may have a GPS in it, but your privacy is still important to your mobile provider.

 Your location services can be switched on or off at any time. If these settings aren't on, your Pokémon GO app won't be able to track your location to find out what kind of Pokémon might be lurking in the tall grass around you.

 To check your location services are on, go into your device's settings. Search for**Privacy & Security** on iOS or**Location** on Android. Make sure your location services are switched on and close and refresh the app.

### Make Sure Pokémon GO Has Permission to Use Your Location

 Apps require explicit permission to be able to track your location. If those permissions aren't given, the app won't use those services. To make sure you've allowed the app to track your location, go into your device's settings again. Scroll down to your list of installed apps, and find**Pokémon GO** .

Close

 Once you’ve opened the Pokémon GO app settings, click on**Location** . Here you can choose what level of access you would like your app to have. Allowing the app to track your location**While Using the App** is the best option. Letting Pokémon GO constantly check your location even when you’re not using the app is unnecessary and can chew through your device's battery.

 It is also recommended that you switch**Precise Location** on so that Pokémon GO gets the most accurate results possible while you’re using the app. Close and reopen the app to ensure the settings have been updated.

### Step Into a Clear Location

 Some places are more difficult for your GPS to track, particularly if they are remote. Perhaps you're inside a building or covered by trees, maybe even both. Being undercover could be enough to disrupt a weak GPS signal, and stepping outside for a moment may help your GPS locate you again.

### Reboot Your Location Settings

 If your permissions are all on, and your Pokémon GO app is still not detecting your GPS, try flicking your phone onto**airplane mode** for a few moments and then turn it back off again. Sometimes if your phone's GPS is having difficulties, this can be enough to reboot it and kick it back into action. You can do this from your phone's settings or by pulling down the toolbar on your iPhone and selecting the**airplane icon** .

 You should now be free to keep catching Pokémon to fill up your Pokédex. If your Pokédex needs a bit of a boost, try [transferring your Pokémon from Pokémon GO to Pokémon HOME](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-transfer-pokemon-go-home/) to complete your collection in other games as well.
