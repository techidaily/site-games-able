## Navigating New Worlds Together: Playing Minecraft Split-Screen on Switch

 Playing multiplayer games with your friends is always a good time, but it can be difficult to do your own thing when you’re sharing the same screen. Usually, one player gets pulled along wherever the other wants to go, and there has to be some sort of compromise. But did you know that if you’re playing Minecraft on a console like the Nintendo Switch, you can play multiplayer split-screen?

 If you want to split your screen with up to four players locally or online and fully enjoy the freedom of Minecraft on the Nintendo Switch, here’s how.

## What Do I Need to Play Two-Player Minecraft on My Nintendo Switch?

 All you need to split your screen and start crafting away on the Switch with your friends is a Nintendo Switch console, Minecraft, and two controllers. The only hardware requirement that it takes to get split-screen multiplayer up and running is a screen that supports at least 720p, but the Switch already has that covered for you.

 Split-screen multiplayer is only available on the console version of Minecraft. That means the PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox versions only. But just because you only have Minecraft on your PC or mobile, doesn't mean you still can't get all your friends involved in creating the ultimate Minecraft world.

 Building an absolutely epic Minecraft city with your friends on split-screen multiplayer could easily take upwards of one hundred hours or more in some cases. The last thing you want is to accidentally delete that Minecraft world and erase all the hard work that went into creating it.

 Backing up anything of importance is always a great idea, so why not add your Minecraft server to that list?[Backing up and restoring deleted Minecraft worlds](https://www.makeuseof.com/minecraft-world-how-to-restore/) can be done on many different devices, but it's much easier to back your world up in the first place than struggle to restore it later.

## Minecraft Is More Fun With a Friend
