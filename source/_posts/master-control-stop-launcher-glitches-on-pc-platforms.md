 If you are facing a similar issue, this guide contains some troubleshooting tips that will help.

## 1\. Close the Epic Games Launcher Completely and Reopen It

## 2\. Run Epic Games Launcher as an Administrator

 Running the Epic Games Launcher with admin rights can help you avoid any issues caused by a lack of relevant permissions to access system files and settings.
