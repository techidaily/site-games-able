## 1 iSlash Heroes

## 2 Fishing Break

Close

 Fishing Break is a casual and colorful challenge. You hop into your boat and travel to different watery worlds, catching fish and creating a collection. Swipe to cast, then tap and hold to reel in your catch. Just be careful not to pull them in too quickly, or they may break the line.
