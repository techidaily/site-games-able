## Mastering the Uninstall of PS5 Gaming

 Unless you have upgraded your PS5 with a beefy SSD card, you are most likely going to have to juggle your games around a little if you want to expand your library. That means deleting your old games to make room for new ones.

 Thankfully, that process is a quick and easy one, and you can clear up some space for your next gaming adventure in less than five minutes if you know how. Deleting games off your console can be nerve-wracking, especially if it's one you’ve sunk hundreds of hours into, but you've really got nothing to lose.

## Does Deleting a Game on My PS5 Delete My Saved Data?

 The number one cause for concern when deleting games off your PS5 is whether it will delete your saved data along with it. Thankfully, you don’t need to worry about that. Deleting a game on your PS5 does not delete your saved data, so you don’t need to let that prevent you from making room on your PS5 for new games.

 Deleting a game on your PS5 removes it from your system, but your saved data is stored elsewhere on your console. Deleting your saved data is a whole other process, and it’s one that you cannot do on accident.

## How Do I Delete a Game on My PS5?

 If you have been playing the game you want to delete recently, and it’s still on your home page, all you need to do is hover over the**game's icon** , press the**Options button** on your controller, and press**Delete** . The game will then be removed from your system, leaving you free to replace it with something else.

 Only the most recently played games appear on your home screen. If the game isn’t on your home screen anymore, scroll to the right and open your**Game Library** . Make sure you’re on the**Installed** tab, find your game, press the options button on your controller, and select**Delete** .

 If you’re having trouble finding the exact game you’re looking for, you can also scroll to the right and select the icon with a downward arrow to utilize the**Sort by** filters. You can sort your games by alphabetical order, from oldest to newest, or even by size to help you find what you’re looking for.

 Of course, not having to go through this process every time you want to download a new game is one of the many[reasons to purchase an SSD for your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/you-should-buy-a-second-ps5-ssd-reasons-why/) . If you are tired of not having enough space and would prefer all your games on your console at once, you can purchase an[internal or external SSD for your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/internal-vs-external-ps5-ssd-how-to-choose/) to expand your storage.

## How Do I Redownload a Game on My PS5?

 If you’re done with your new adventure and miss the old game you deleted to make room for it, redownloading a game is as easy as deleting it in the first place. Simply head to the**Game Library** again, but instead of looking through the**Installed** tab, flick to**Your Collection** .

 Find the game you’re looking for using the**Sort by** feature or just browsing the old-fashioned way. Once you’ve landed on your game, press the options button on your controller and select**Download** . The game will automatically start downloading back onto your console for you, provided you have enough space for it.

## Don’t Let Limited Space Prevent You From Playing New PS5 Games

 The PS5 doesn’t have all the space in the world, and as games are becoming more amazing, the file sizes are getting bigger. Thankfully, juggling your space by downloading and redownloading games as you need them is a very simple process, and you don’t need any extra devices or storage options to do it.

 If you’ve been keeping all your old games on your PS5 because you didn’t want to delete your saved data as well, hopefully this guide has put your mind at ease, and you can rest easy knowing your saved data is tucked safely away in your console even after the game’s gone.
