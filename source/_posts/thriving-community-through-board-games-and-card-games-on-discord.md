## What Are Discord Activities?

 Discord Activities are simple interactive games that you can play within Discord's interface. There are over a dozen activities to choose from, including Chess in the Park, which allows you to challenge a friend to a quick game of chess, and Watch Together, which lets you watch YouTube with a friend without worrying about being out of sync.

 Discord Activities offer a variety of options that cater to everyone's preferences, whether you're looking for a quick distraction or a longer, more engaging activity. Since they're built into Discord, you don't need anything other than Discord to run these activities. In addition, they're lightweight and web-hosted, so you don't need an expensive computer to run them.

 If it's your first time using Discord and you want to get a hold of your surroundings first, we recommend you read our guide on[getting started with Discord](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-started-discord-beginners-guide/) .

 These activities are perfect for spending time with your friends, as they give you something to do together while you talk, and add a new level of entertainment to your conversations.

## How to Join an Existing Activity on a Discord Channel

 It's not always the case that you're the host of a Discord activity. If someone else has started an activity, you can join them with a few clicks. Just join a Discord call or voice channel where your friend is hosting an activity. You can see if there is an ongoing activity next to the channel title.

![Joining an activity on Discord](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/joining-an-activity-on-discord.jpg)

 Once in, click**Join Activity** to join them. If you haven't previously authorized the activity, click**Authorize** to get it started. If you're looking for people to play with, try[joining one of the best Discord servers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-find-best-discord-servers/) .

 With a wide variety of options and cross-platform compatibility, activities add a new dimension to your Discord experience. So next time you're in a voice channel, give an activity a try and see how it enhances your interactions. If you're a developer, Discord even provides[a platform for you to create your own activities](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity#step-4-running-your-app-locally-in-discord) and share them with the community.
