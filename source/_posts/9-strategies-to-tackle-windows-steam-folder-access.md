## 9 Strategies to Tackle Windows Steam Folder Access

 While Steam is without any issues for many, some users face the “Steam library folder not writable” error when they try to install a game using the Steam client. The error also appears while installing an update for the app.

 If you face the same predicament, don’t fret. Let's explore multiple methods to resolve this annoying error code and help you successfully install your games on Steam again.

## 1\. Change the Steam Folder Attributes

 Steam needs to have both read and write permissions to make changes to any sub-folder inside the Steam folder. If the steamapps folder is set to "read-only," the error can pop up and prevent you from installing the game. Repeat the following steps to change the Steam folder attributes:

1. Press**Win + E** to [open a new File Explorer window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .
2. Type the following path in the address bar at the top and press the**Enter** key to navigate to it:**C:\\Program Files (x86)**
3. Double-click on the**Steam** folder. Now, right-click on the**steamapps** folder and select the**Properties** option from the context menu.
4. Navigate to the**Attributes** section and uncheck the**Read-only** option.

5. Click on the**Apply** button and then click on the**OK** button.
6. Close the File Explorer window and reopen the Steam client.
7. Try to install the game and check if the error appears or not.

## 2\. Run the Steam App With Administrator Privileges

 Missing privileges can cause issues with some features in Steam. So, you must close and restart the Steam app with admin rights. Here’s how:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys together to [launch Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) .
2. Find the**Steam** process and right-click on it. Select the**End Task** Option.
3. Press the**Win** key, type**Steam** , and click on the**Run as administrator** option.

4. The User Account Control window will launch. Click on the**Yes** button.

## 3\. Grant Full Ownership of the Steam Folder

 If you don’t have complete ownership of the Steam folder, you can face problems while installing a game or making changes to any file or folder. Repeat the following steps to gain complete ownership of the Steam folder:

1. Press**Win + E** to open the File Explorer.
2. Type " C:\\Program Files (x86)" in the address bar at the top and press**Enter** to navigate to it:
3. Click on the**Steam** folder to select it. Then, press**Alt + Enter** to open the**Properties** window.
4. Switch to the**Security** tab.
5. Click on the**Edit** button.
6. Select your User Profile and click on the**Edit** button.
7. Click on the**Full Control** checkbox to grant all the permissions for your user profile.

8. Now, click on the**Apply** button.
9. Lastly, click on the**OK** button and then close the Properties window.

## 4\. Repair the Steam Library Folder

 Steam offers the option to repair the Steam library folders to fix issues with it. Here’s how to repair the folder using the Steam app:

1. Open the Steam client.
2. Click on the**Steam** button at the top left corner and then click on the**Settings** option in the context menu.
3. Scroll down and click on the**Storage** option.
4. Click on the**horizontal ellipsis** (three dots) button. Select the**Repair folder** option.  
![Repair the Steam Library Folder-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/repair-the-steam-library-folder-1.jpg)
5. The User Account Control window will pop up. Click on the**Yes** button.
6. After the repair completes, click on the**Close** button.

## 5\. Re-Add the Steam Library Folder

 If you still face the “Steam library folder not writable” error, you must remove and re-add the Steam library folder using the Storage settings. Repeat the following steps:

1. Open the Steam client.
2. Click on the**Steam** button and then click on the**Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the**Storage** option.
4. Select a Steam library folder and then click on the**horizontal ellipsis** (three dots) button. Select the**Remove Drive** option.
5. Now, click on the**plus** icon. Select the folder location and click on the**Add** button.
6. Close and relaunch Steam.

## 6\. Flush the Steam Download Cache

 An outdated or corrupt download cache can cause interference while installing games or updating the Steam client. So, you must empty the Steam download cache using the settings. Repeat the following steps to do so:

1. Launch the Steam client on your PC.
2. Click on the**Steam** button and then click on the**Settings** option to open the app settings.
3. Navigate down and click on the**Downloads** option.
4. Find the**Clear Download Cache** option in the right pane. Click on the**Clear Cache** button.  
![Flush the Download Cache-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/flush-the-download-cache-1.jpg)
5. Steam will reconfirm your decision to clear the cache. Click on the**Confirm** button.
6. The app will restart after purging the download cache. You will have to sign in again to your Steam account.

## 7\. Run a Check Disk Scan

 Hard Disk errors can be a reason due to which Steam is unable to add or modify files. You can [use the Check Disk utility in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/) to check your hard disk for errors and fix them. The Check Disk utility will scan the hard disk for errors and repair them, if possible.

## 8\. Reinstall the Game on Another Drive

 If you are unable to install the game on the C drive, you must add another drive in the Steam Storage settings. Then, attempt the game installation in the newly added drive. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the Steam app and click on the**Steam** button.
2. Click on the**Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the**Storage** option.
4. Click on the**plus** icon. Expand the drop-down list and select a drive.  
![Reinstall the Game on Another Drive-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reinstall-the-game-on-another-drive-1.jpg)
5. Now, click on the**Add** button.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.

 As such, you must assign a new driver letter and reformat the disk. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the**Start** menu and type**create and format disk partitions** . Click on the**Open** option in the right pane.
2. Right-click on the new drive whose letter you want to change. Select the**Change Drive Letter and Paths** option.
3. Click on the**Change** button.  
![Format the Disk And Try Again-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/format-the-disk-and-try-again-1.jpg)
4. Expand the drop-down list and select a new drive letter. Click on the**OK** button.
5. Now, right-click on the disk drive and select the**Format** option.
6. Keep the**File System** as**NTFS** and click on the**OK** button.  
![Format the Disk And Try Again 2-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/format-the-disk-and-try-again-2-1.jpg)
7. Lastly, click on the**OK** button once again.
8. **Close** the Disk Management utility.

## Make Your Steam Library Folder Writable Again on Windows

 These were the methods to fix the “Steam library folder not writable” error. Start by changing the file attributes and relaunching the Steam app with administrator rights. After that, repair the Steam library folder, flush the download cache, and run a check disk scan to fix disk errors.
