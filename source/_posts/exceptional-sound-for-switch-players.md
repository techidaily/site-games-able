 The Nintendo Switch's speakers, particularly on the Switch OLED, aren't bad. But one of the best ways to get the most out of Nintendo's beloved handheld is to invest in a quality gaming headset to enhance your gameplay.

 So whether you game on the go or in the comfort of your own home, why not get an audio upgrade and pick out a great headset to enrich your gaming? These are some of the best headphones you can get for the Nintendo Switch.
