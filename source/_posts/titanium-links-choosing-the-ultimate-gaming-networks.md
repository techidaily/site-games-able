##### Dacrown Cat 8 Ethernet Cable RJ45

Best Overall

 High-speed performance, future-proofing, and durability wrapped into one

 With a combination of shielding and maximum bandwidth, the Dacrown Cat 8 Ethernet Cable has all the workings to handle large data transfers for several years to come. Its resistance and thicker gauge also means you won’t be replacing it any time soon.

**Pros**

* 40GB per second data transfer rate
* Excellent data transfer capabilities
* UV-resistant PVC outer covering
* Length options range between 1.5 feet to 150 feet
* Very thick gauge

**Cons**

* A bit overkill for gaming

[$20 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QWC3CQN?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002571&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-ethernet-cables-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate)

 If you're planning on doing some heavy data transfers, you can't go wrong with the Dacrown Cat 8 RJ45 Ethernet Cable. The main reasons are simple: 2GHz frequency with a 40Gbps transfer cap. Yes, it is a bit of an overkill for gaming, but picking the Dacrown Cat 8 RJ45 Ethernet Cable now means you'll be future-proofing your home. Internet speeds are only getting faster, and this ensures you'll be the first to experience them when it does.

 What's also great are the length options. What's the point of using a 6-foot Ethernet cable to connect your PC to a modem that's two feet away? The Dacrown Cat 8 Ethernet Cable has size options as small as 1.5 feet. Alternatively, if you need something exponentially longer, you can go with a 150-foot cable.

 Lastly, the Dacrown Cat 8 Ethernet Cable is no slouch in the durability department. It features a gold-plated RJ45, meaning it's quite resistant to oxidation. Additionally, its thicker gauge is a godsend for protecting the PVC and UV-resistant wires inside.

 There's fast, and then there's really fast, and not everyone needs the latter. When you need a quick, value-packed solution that's still fast, the Amazon Basics Cat-6 Ethernet Cable lines up perfectly with your needs.

 While the Amazon Basics Cat-6 Ethernet Cable has a thinner bandwidth—up to 250MHz—it's still plenty good if all you ever do is use social media and stream media. In fact, the gold-plated RJ45 connectors keep the signal strong and even resist corrosion.

 The Amazon Basics Snagless RJ45 Cat-6 Ethernet Cable Pack also comes in multiple colors. If you opt for the multi-colored package, it's actually really helpful for color-coding devices. However, its most underrated feature is the snagless design, which prevents the connector from getting damaged whenever you have to unplug the cable for maintenance.

* Wide bandwidth

 For starters, the Vandesail Cat7 Ethernet Cable can handle up to 10Gbps of data, with a bandwidth of 1000MHz.

If you stream, it’s especially helpful to have a lot of wiggle room to keep your stream’s quality intact.

 What the Vandesail Cat7 Ethernet Cable features on the outside s just as important as what it offers on the inside. Due to its flatter design, it’s much easier to tuck under rugs and along corners. Additionally, the wear-resistant PVC material gives the cable a great deal of toughness against bending and twisting.

## Choosing the Best Ethernet Cable For Gaming

 The good news is that picking the best Ethernet for gaming really comes down to performance and what the cable can handle in terms of data transfer and bandwidth. Durability is certainly a concern, too, but anything beyond that is dressing.

 If you want to eke out as much performance as possible or you like to stream, the Dacrown Cat 8 Ethernet Cable is an all-around fantastic option. As a Cat 8 cable, you're getting some of the fastest data transfers and the widest bandwidth. It's also quite durable and can take a beating.

 Of course, if your internet speeds are nowhere near what a Cat 8 cable can handle, the Amazon Basics Cat-6 Ethernet Cable is the next best thing. The performance is reigned in, and the bandwidth is much more narrow, but if your internet speeds don't exceed 1Gbps, then you have nothing to worry about. You also gain the benefit of multiple cables in a single pack.
