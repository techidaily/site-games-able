## Exclusive 165Hz PC Gaming Displays

 Building a killer gaming rig doesn't end with choosing the most powerful GPU or CPU; you'll also need a high-quality gaming monitor. While[144Hz monitors](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-144hz-gaming-monitors/) used to be the sweet spot for most gamers, a new wave of 165Hz monitors promises even more fluid and responsive gaming experiences.

 It might not be much of an upgrade if you already have a 144Hz monitor, but going from the standard 60Hz to 165Hz is a night-and-day difference. In addition, 165Hz monitors tend to be more affordable than 240Hz and 360Hz monitors, offering a nice balance between performance and value.

Here are the best 165Hz monitors available today.

 The LG 27GP850-B is a 1440p monitor with a fast 165Hz Nano IPS panel, a combination that hits the sweet spot for gaming. It strikes a nice balance between great performance and solid visuals without being too heavy on your graphics cards, unlike 4K alternatives.

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LG-27GP850-B-Ultragear-Compatible-Adjustable/dp/B093MTSTKD?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2026433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-165hz-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$430 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16824026195)

 A 165Hz monitor is worthless if your gaming rig can't consistently push 165 frames per second (FPS). This 27-inch 1440p IPS display offers the optimal screen size and resolution for a 165Hz gaming monitor. It allows you to easily hit the maximum refresh rates with a mid-range PC build without sacrificing image quality, making it the best option for most people.

 The 27GP850-B's gaming performance is up there with the best. It boasts a lightning-fast 1ms pixel response time and low input lag on top of the 165Hz refresh rate, which makes everything feel fast and responsive. But what really sets this monitor apart is that it can be overclocked to 180Hz, and it supports both FreeSync and G-SYNC, making it the fastest, smoothest 165Hz monitor you can get.

 In addition to outstanding gaming performance, the Nano IPS panel produces gorgeous colors with wide viewing angles, which come in handy if you want to share the display with a friend. The 1440p resolution also delivers sharp images and text at 27 inches. So, if you wish to fire up some games, edit photos and videos, or browse the web, this monitor can handle everything you throw at it.

 The Odyssey Neo G7 from Samsung may come at a higher price, but it delivers stunning visuals and an immersive gaming experience unmatched by other 165Hz gaming monitors. Its biggest highlight is the bright and vibrant mini-LED display with 1,196 dimming zones and up to 2,000 nits of brightness that produces deeper blacks and much brighter highlights, making it perfect for HDR gaming. Non-HDR games also look absolutely stunning, thanks to the improved contrast and vibrant colors.

 Elsewhere, the Odyssey Neo G7 has most of the features gamers love. It supports HDMI 2.1 bandwidth to maintain 4K 120Hz compatibility with the PS5 and Xbox Series X. In addition to the 165Hz refresh rate, a fast 1ms response time and native support for Freesync Premium Pro ensure a smooth HDR gaming experience with little blur around fast-moving objects for improved clarity. If you need more speed and clarity, Samsung also offers an upgraded model with a 240Hz refresh rate.

Best Value

##### ASUS VG248QG Gaming Monitor

Spend less on a 165Hz monitor

 The ASUS VG248QG is an affordable 165Hz gaming monitor with a class-leading 0.5ms response time, making it ideal for competitive gaming. It packs many advanced gaming features, including backlight strobing and G-SYNC, but its TN panel doesn't have the best viewing angles.

**Pros**

* Outstanding motion handling
* FreeSync support and G-SYNC compatibility
* Ergonomic design
* Rich connectivity

**Cons**

* Poor viewing angles

[$189 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/VG248QG-G-Sync-Compatible-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B07TNM8L6S?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2026433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-165hz-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$190 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-asus-vg248qg-90lmgg901q022eul-24%2Fp%2FN82E16824236978) [$210 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-vg248qg-24-widescreen-lcd-elmb-sync-adaptive-sync-snd-freesync-compatible-fhd-gaming-monitor-displayport-hdmi-black%2F6373927.p%3FskuId%3D6373927)

 The ASUS VG248QG is a perfect option if you want an inexpensive 165Hz gaming monitor for competitive gaming. It combines the higher refresh rate with an impressive 0.5ms response time and a powerful backlight strobing feature to eliminate persistent blur, resulting in one of the clearest monitors in motion you can get without breaking the bank.

 It gets better. The VG248QG has native support for FreeSync VRR and G-SYNC compatibility, so you can expect a smooth and tear-free gaming experience, whether using an AMD or NVIDIA graphics card. In addition, you can tap into the ASUS GamePlus and GameVisual features for improved visibility and accuracy to get that extra advantage in fast-paced games.

 The speed and clarity of this monitor come at a price, though. It uses a TN panel with noticeably poor viewing angles and washed-out colors compared to an IPS or VA panel. However, that will only be a dealbreaker if you also want to use the monitor for productivity tasks—it performs exceptionally well for gaming.

Best Ultrawide

##### Alienware AW3423DWF Gaming Monitor

Next-level gaming immersion

 $1000$1100 Save $100

 Between its 34-inch curved screen, vivid QD-OLED panel, enhanced brightness, solid Adaptive Sync support, and near-instant response times, Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF delivers one of the most immersive and responsive gaming experiences, making it the best 165Hz ultrawide monitor you can buy right now.

**Pros**

* Immersive 34-inch curved display
* Stunning SDR and HDR images
* Ultra-quick response time
* FreeSync and G-SYNC Compatible

**Cons**

* Still pricey

[$1100 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Falienware-aw3423dwf-34-quantum-dot-oled-curved-ultrawide-gaming-monitor-165hz-amd-freesync-premium-pro-vesa-hdmiusb-dark-side-of-the-moon%2F6536990.p%3FskuId%3D6536990)

 Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF is one of the best ultrawide gaming monitors you can get right now, combining a 165Hz refresh rate with QD-OLED technology to deliver a fast and immersive experience. This monitor undercuts Dell's own Alienware AW3423DW and the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 while offering all the benefits of the enhanced QD-OLED panel, like improved brightness, a true HDR picture, oversaturated colors, and an infinite contrast ratio that results in deep, inky blacks.

 Modern HDR-capable games like Doom Eternal and Cyberpunk 2077 look gorgeous here, and the fast refresh rate and nearly instantaneous response time deliver a silky smooth gaming experience with excellent motion clarity, which is perfect for highly intense FPS games.

 While the panel is only certified FreeSync Premium Pro, VRR works on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, so you don't have to worry about screen tearing or choppy frames. In addition, the 1800R curvature and 3440x1440 resolution combine to add more immersion and detail to games and movies.

![Pixio PXC277 Advanced](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pixio-pxc277-advanced.jpg)

Best Budget 1440p

##### Pixio PXC277 Advanced

Best budget 1440p 165Hz monitor

 $240$300 Save $60

 If you're on a tight budget but still want a good 1440p 165Hz gaming monitor, consider the Pixio PXC277 Advanced. It's one of the most affordable 1440p monitors, and it packs useful gaming features at a price that's affordable to most people.

**Pros**

* Incredible value
* Brilliant contrast and rich colors
* Fast response time
* HDR support

**Cons**

* Tilt-only stand

[$220 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pixio-Advanced-Response-Resolution-Adaptive/dp/B0BSYF9C19?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2026433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-165hz-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$300 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F3D4-000Y-00012)

 The Pixio PXC277 Advanced massively undercuts our top choice's price point while still hitting the same sweet spot of 1440p at 165Hz. Admittedly, the build quality feels cheaper than the LG 27GP850-B, and the design of the stand could be better, but none of these factors are likely to be dealbreakers for gaming. Besides, the VA panel produces deep blacks and more detail in shadows, resulting in a more immersive viewing experience.

 The PXC277 gets everything right when it comes to gaming. It accompanies the 165Hz refresh rate with a fast 1ms response time, allowing you to see all the action unfolding on your screen as quickly and clearly as possible. There is no FreeSync or G-SYNC certification here, but the display is compatible with Adaptive Sync, so you can still enjoy smooth visuals and gameplay.

Best Budget Ultrawide

##### Samsung Odyssey G55T

Best budget 165Hz ultrawide monitor

 $370$550 Save $180

 The Samsung Odyssey G55T has a lot going for it, including a 165Hz refresh rate, a 1ms response time, FreeSync Premium, and a sharp, vibrant display packed into a relatively affordable 34-inch curved panel.

**Pros**

* Curved, 34-inch display
* 165Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time
* HDR10 support

**Cons**

* Stand is lackluster and mounting options are limited by design

[$370 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-34-Inch-Ultra-Wide-FreeSync-LC34G55TWWNXZA/dp/B08MVBYWGQ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2026433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-165hz-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$550 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-34-odyssey-g5-1000r-curved-1ms-165hz-qhd-freesync-prem-gaming-monitor-black%2F6445082.p%3FskuId%3D6445082) [$400 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F34-g5-odyssey-gaming-monitor-with-1000r-curved-screen-lc34g55twwnxza%2Fp%2FN82E16824022912)

 For less than half the price of the Alienware AW3423DWF, you can get the Samsung Odyssey G55T, an excellent entry-level ultrawide monitor for work and gaming. It's an excellent alternative if you want something affordable without sacrificing gaming performance or picture quality. While it can't match the contrast and black levels of an OLED display, this monitor is still miles better than some premium IPS options, so you're still in for an immersive and stunning viewing experience without breaking the bank.

 Designed for gaming first, the Odyssey G55T boasts a 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, FreeSync Premium VRR, and plenty of in-game enhancements to give you an advantage in competitive games with smooth transitions and excellent clarity in fast-paced scenes. In addition, the 3440x1440 resolution produces sharp and detailed images, which, combined with the 1000R curve and decent HDR performance, help breathe life into your games and movies.

## Choosing the Perfect 165Hz Monitor for Your Gaming Setup

 While 165Hz monitors are still relatively new compared to 144Hz or even 240Hz monitors, there are still plenty of options available, so you can be sure to find one that fits your needs and budget. We've included a wide range of 165Hz monitors, from high-end OLED and mini LED screens to affordable displays, ideal for those starting out or considering an upgrade on tight budgets.

 If you don't want to go through all the options, we highly recommend the LG 27GP850-B, a 27-inch 1440p monitor. This monitor provides the ideal combination of gaming performance, picture quality, and price, making it accessible to a wider range of users. However, if budget is not a concern, you can opt for the mini-LED Odyssey Neo G7 by Samsung or the OLED Alienware AW3423DWF for an even more stunning and immersive viewing experience.

 Budget monitors have also made huge strides, with monitors like the ASUS VG248QG offering solid features for a much lower price. Although it may not have the best viewing angles or color reproduction, this monitor is a solid option if you're looking for a 165Hz monitor solely for gaming.
