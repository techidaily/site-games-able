## The Pros of Buying Digital Games

 For gamers who value convenience and accessibility, digital game purchases offer numerous advantages. Let’s look at them below.

### 1\. Digital Games Are Easy to Purchase and Store

 One of the major benefits of owning digital games is the convenience of obtaining them. There's no need to go to a physical store or wait for the delivery of an online order. Moreover, finding a physical copy of an older game can sometimes be challenging, but acquiring its digital version is as easy as completing the purchase and downloading it.

 Another benefit of buying a digital game is that you don’t need to store it physically. This means no space taken up on your shelves, and no risk of damage or theft. Plus, your entire game library travels with you wherever you go, as long as you have your login credentials and a compatible device.

### 2\. Switching Between Digitally-Owned Games Is a Breeze

 If you are someone who likes to bounce between different titles throughout your gaming session, digital games offer great convenience. With them, you can jump right into whichever title piques your interest at the moment.

 Unlike physical games, there’s no need to dig through drawers and swap discs. Your digital games are always readily available, and you can switch between them effortlessly.

### 3\. The Seamless Experience of Automatic Updates

 On most devices, digital games are updated automatically by default. This may not seem like a big deal, but it can save you from the frustration of encountering a large update prompt just as you're eager to play your favorite game.

 Automatic updates ensure that your favorite titles are ready to play when you want them, without having to wait for updates to download and install.

### 4\. Digital-Only Consoles Are Less Expensive

 Another perk of going all digital is that the price of digital-only consoles is usually lower compared to consoles that can play physical discs. This can be beneficial when you decide to upgrade to the latest version of the console.

 Also, with your games being digital, you don’t have to deal with issues like a [PS5 disc drive making way too much noise](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-fix-noisy-ps5-disc-drive/) or getting stuck. This means you can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay without the annoyance of disc-related malfunctions.

### 5\. You Can Opt for Value-for-Money Subscription Services

 With digital games, individual purchases aren't always necessary. Instead, you can opt for gaming subscriptions like PS Plus, Game Pass, or EA Play. Similar to how you subscribe to Netflix instead of purchasing individual movies, these gaming subscriptions offer a variety of benefits for a monthly fee, which is approximately the cost of a single game.

 This model enables you to explore various genres and discover new favorites without needing to make separate purchases. Additionally, many gaming subscriptions offer trial periods where you can play games for a few hours before deciding to make a purchase.

## The Cons of Buying Digital Games

 While buying digital copies of games may seem like a no-brainer at this point, there are some downsides to consider.

### 1\. Digital Games Can Quickly Fill Up Your Console’s Storage Space

 While digital games eliminate the need to store them physically, they can quickly eat up the storage space on your console. With many modern games easily reaching 50GB or more in size, you will constantly find yourself looking for [ways to get more storage space on your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-storage-how-to-increase-manage/) or Xbox Series X|S.

 As a result, you may need to uninstall or move unplayed games to an external drive every now and then. While [adding extra storage to your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-m2-ssd-ps5-guide/) or Xbox is always an option, it does come with additional expenses.

### 2\. They Are Difficult to Share or Sell

 Sharing digital games with friends is not as straightforward as sharing physical games, because it often requires sharing your account credentials. This can pose a security risk and potentially lead to unauthorized alterations to your account settings.

 However, you can share digital games within your household through [Steam Families](https://www.makeuseof.com/valve-updated-steam-families-sharing/) or [PS5 game sharing](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-game-sharing-playstation-5/) .

 But when it comes to selling your games once you've finished playing them; you won't be able to recoup some of the initial costs of purchasing the game by selling it on eBay or other platforms if you don't have a physical disc.

### 3\. You Don't Actually Own Your Digital Games

 When you purchase a digital game, you're not technically buying the game itself, but rather a license to play it. Unlike physical copies, where ownership is usually more straightforward, digital licenses often come with restrictions and conditions.

 For example, there's no guarantee that the game will always be available. If the publisher or developer revokes the license, or if there are legal issues, you could lose access to it. However, it's worth noting that such instances of games being delisted are relatively rare.

### 4\. Vulnerability to Account Issues

 The security of your account becomes crucial when all your digital games and purchases are linked to them. It’s like having all the eggs in one basket. Losing access to your account, whether through hacking, phishing, or other means, can lead to a difficult situation where you may lose access to your entire library of games and purchases.

 To avoid this, you may need to implement additional security measures such as two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, and regularly monitoring your account activity.

 So, those are the advantages and disadvantages of owning digital games. Considering the fact that 95% of games sold in 2023 were digital (as reported by [GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023) ), it's fair to say that most people prefer digital games and are willing to live with some of the compromises tied to them.

 That said, choosing digital games over their physical counterparts often comes down to personal preference, with factors like convenience, access, and pricing influencing individual decisions.
