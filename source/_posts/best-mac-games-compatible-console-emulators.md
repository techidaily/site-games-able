 Ryujinx is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator that allows you to transcend the boundaries of Nintendo's iconic handheld console and enjoy all the [captivating Switch games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-nintendo-switch-games/) on your Mac. It has native support for Apple silicon, meaning it takes full advantage of the hardware, and it works shockingly well, especially considering that you're emulating a relatively modern console.

 In my testing, I managed to maintain a steady 30–40FPS at 1080p while running the Nintendo Switch port of Red Dead Redemption, and I highly recommend the emulator to anyone wanting to play Nintendo Switch games on their Mac.

 The PSP continues to hold its status as one of the finest portable gaming consoles ever created. Thanks to the PPSSPP emulator, Mac users can now enjoy their cherished exclusives, such as Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.
