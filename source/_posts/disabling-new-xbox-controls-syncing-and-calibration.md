## Things to Note Before Reverting Your Xbox Wireless Controller's Firmware

 Before you go through with reverting an Xbox Wireless Controller update, there are a few things you should know beforehand, as the process has a few caveats. Specifically, the main points you should be aware of before reverting firmware for your controller are as follows:

* Most commonly, reverting an Xbox Wireless Controller update will correct issues with Bluetooth connectivity to non-Xbox devices, like a laptop. If the issue with your controller affects how it functions with your Xbox Series X|S, it isn't guaranteed that reverting the firmware will help.
* You are more likely to experience issues from Xbox updates if you[join the Xbox Insider Program](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-join-xbox-insider/) . You may want to leave the program to prevent further firmware issues.
* Reverting the firmware of Xbox Wireless Controllers on your Xbox Series X|S isn't compatible with some older controller models.

 While these factors can prevent a firmware reset from correcting your controller issue, there are still ways you can fix your specific problem. If the issue is tied to your console, you may want to[troubleshoot your Xbox Series X|S by placing it in Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-xs-safe-mode-startup-troubleshooter/) or exiting the Xbox Preview Program.

 But if the caveats of reverting firmware don't apply to you, your controller issue is likely caused by a firmware problem, and you're all set to go ahead with reverting your controller update.
