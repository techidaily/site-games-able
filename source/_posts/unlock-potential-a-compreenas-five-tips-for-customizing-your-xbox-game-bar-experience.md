## Unlock Potential: A Compreenas Five Tips for Customizing Your Xbox Game Bar Experience

 The Xbox Game Bar allows you to access things quickly and easily without having to exit your game completely to do so. It may seem like a small addition to your PC gaming experience, but it has the potential to become massively helpful if you customize it to suit your needs perfectly.

 Many gamers take the Xbox Game Bar for granted or only use its most basic functions. But if you would like to learn more about the Xbox Game Bar and how you can personalize it to suit your perfect gaming experience, we have all the information you need here.

## 1\. Create Customized Keyboard Shortcuts for Your Xbox Game Bar

 The Xbox Game Bar comes equipped with plenty of keyboard shortcuts to make your tasks as simple as possible, so you can get back to your game quickly.

 A majority of the most common shortcuts are already there waiting for you to use like**Windows Key + Alt + Print Screen** to take a screenshot (without the Xbox Game Bar partially covering the display) or**Windows Key + Alt + R** to start recording your gameplay.

![Customize Shortcuts on Xbox Game Bar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/customize-shortcuts-on-xbox-game-bar.jpg)

 These are default shortcuts, however, and you may have your own ideas in mind. To create your own shortcuts, open the Xbox Game Bar by pressing the**Windows Key + G** and opening the**Settings** . Select**Shortcuts** , and enter new ones or restructure existing ones to create your perfect shortcut menu. Press**Save** to confirm your changes.

## 2\. Add Favorites to Your Xbox Game Bar

 The Xbox Game Bar has many features available to help make your gaming experience easier, but we all have favorites. Having one of your favorite features that you access most often hidden deep within the menus of your Game Bar defeats the purpose of the Xbox Game Bar itself, which is to make things quicker and easier for you to access while gaming.

![Favorite Icon on Xbox Game Bar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/favorite-icon-on-xbox-game-bar.jpg)

 In these cases, you can 'favorite' certain features of the Game Bar, so they always appear on the Home Bar. To do so, find your favorite feature and press the**star icon** to the right of it. That will mark your feature as a favorite, so it will always be available to you whenever you need it.

## 4\. Add Gaming Features to Your Games or Apps

 Most games are already recognized as such by your Xbox Game Bar, but occasionally things get missed. You may even have an app you would like your Game Bar to treat as a game.

![Remember This is a Game Setting on Xbox Game Box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/remember-this-is-a-game-setting-on-xbox-game-box.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If so, press the**Windows Key + G** to bring up your Xbox Game Bar while you’re using the app or game in question. Head to the**settings** , and select the**checkbox** that reads**Remember this is a game** . If the checkbox isn’t available, the app is already recognized as a game, and you are free to continue playing with all the features you need.
