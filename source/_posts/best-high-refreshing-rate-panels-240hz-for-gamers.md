## Best 240Hz Gaming Monitor Overall: ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQDM

![The ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQDM desk setup with an ASUS gaming PC.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/asus-rog-swift-pg27aqdm.jpg)

_ASUS_

 The [ASUS ROG Swift PG27AQDM](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQDM/dp/B0BZRBYLP1?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032270&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-240hz-monitors-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has a 1440p resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. At 27 inches, the resolution produces sharp and detailed images, but unlike 4K, it doesn't require a high-end graphics card to maintain a high frame rate. ASUS matches the 240Hz refresh rate with a lightning-fast 0.03 ms response time. The near-instant response time eliminates motion blur in fast-moving objects for excellent motion clarity.

 Besides its gaming prowess, the PG27AQDM produces stunning picture quality with its vibrant OLED display. It has the typical deep blacks and incredible contrast of OLED panels, but it can also reach 1,300 nits of brightness to make colors and highlights pop. Watching movies or playing HDR games is a visual delight. This monitor also offers [burn-in prevention features](https://www.makeuseof.com/prevent-screen-burn-in-on-oled-monitor-and-tv/) and a two-year warranty against burn-in.

## Best Budget 240Hz Gaming Monitor: AOC C27G2Z

![The AOC C27G2Z 240Hz monitor on a red background.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/aoc-c27g2z.jpg)

_AOC_

 If our top pick is a little too expensive, AOC has a good budget alternative with the [C27G2Z Gaming Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/AOC-C27G2Z-Frameless-Ultra-Fast-Adjustable/dp/B088LG2BSW?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032270&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-240hz-monitors-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) . It's not as sharp and accurate as the ASUS, but it holds up really well when it comes to gaming. The 0.5ms response time keeps up with the 240Hz refresh rate, and it also supports FreeSync and G-Sync, checking all the boxes for competitive gamers.

 The AOC C27G2Z uses a VA panel, so it processes darker scenes really well, although there can be some minor blooming in complex scenes. At its price point, it's an excellent value for anyone looking for a 240Hz gaming monitor. As a 1080p monitor, even a budget-friendly RTX 3060 build can take advantage of its full capabilities.

## FAQ

### Q: What does Hz stand for?

 Hertz (Hz) is a unit for measuring the refresh rate of a display. A 240Hz monitor, for instance, means the display is refreshing 240 times per second.

### Q: How important is refresh rate for gaming?

 A high refresh rate monitor can significantly improve your gaming experience, especially for competitive and fast-paced games. A higher refresh rate renders more frames quickly, allowing gamers to see and react to in-game action more quickly than opponents on a low refresh rate display. Refreshing the monitor quickly also results in smoother motion and reduced input lag.

### Q: Can I get a 240Hz 4K monitor?

 Yes, 4K 240Hz monitors have been out for a while now. The [Dell Alienware AW3225QF](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Falienware-aw3225qf-31-6-quantum-dot-oled-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-nvidia-g-sync-vesa-hdmi-usb-c-lunar-light%2F6576612.p%3FskuId%3D6576612) is our top choice for a 4K 240Hz monitor, but there are also other good alternatives, like Samsung's Mini-LED [Odyssey Neo G8](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-FreeSync-Ultrawide-DisplayPort/dp/B09ZH3WM47?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032270&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-240hz-monitors-for-gaming%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) .

### Q: If I had to decide between 240Hz or 4K for gaming, which is better?

 Choosing between a 240Hz and 4K gaming monitor depends on the type of games you play most often. A 240Hz monitor is ideal for fast-paced games like first-person shooters and racing games. On the other hand, the stunning visuals and immersive detail of 4K monitors make them ideal for open-world games or single-player adventures. However, if you want the best of both worlds,[high-end 4K 240Hz displays](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Falienware-aw3225qf-31-6-quantum-dot-oled-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-nvidia-g-sync-vesa-hdmi-usb-c-lunar-light%2F6576612.p%3FskuId%3D6576612) are emerging, offering the ultimate combination of smooth performance and sharp visuals.
