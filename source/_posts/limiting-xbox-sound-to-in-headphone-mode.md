## Limiting Xbox Sound to In-Headphone Mode

 In the past, consoles like the PlayStation 4 would automatically mute your device audio when you attach a headset to your controller, guaranteeing sound only plays through your headset.

 Luckily, correcting this problem is quick and easy. So, if you want to ensure that audio output prioritizes attached headsets and mutes all other output devices on Xbox Series X|S, we can help.
