## Tecno's Smarter Design, More Vibrant Appeal

 Looking to grab an increased share of the laptop market, Tecno is seeking to make a splash with its reveal of two new laptops the Tecno Megabook T1 2023 14-inch and the Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition. While we've seen more surprising and eye-catching releases from Tecno, including their recent Phantom V Fold, this year's event in Berlin focuses on refreshing their popular laptop lineup with increased portability and personality.

## Tecno Megabook T1 14": Smaller, Yet Longer Battery Life

 Building off the success of their popular Megabook T1, Tecno wanted to make an even more portable version that still retained its excellent selection of I/O and features. You'd think downsizing from a 15.6" chassis to a smaller 14" would also result in sacrificed battery capacity.

 While its thickness of 14.8mm remains unchanged from last year's Megabook 15.6", the new T1 14" is lighter at 1.39kg (vs 1.48kg) and manages to fit a larger 75Wh (vs 70Wh) battery which claims to provide 1 hour of extra runtime at up to 18.5 hours. For fast charging, you'll find the same 65W GaN power adapter.

 Although the smaller 14" display may not seem as appealing if you prefer having extra screen real estate, the T1 14" has upgraded to a 16:10 aspect ratio with a screen-to-body ratio of 90%, and still provides 100%sRGB color and TUV eye protection. Rounding off this new model, it retains the Red Dot Design Award from last year with its "premium aluminum metallic body," offering a great balance of portability, performance, and the largest battery in its price range.

## Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition

 Rather than a complete redesign, TECNO showcased a concept special, "Dazzling" edition S1\. While its chassis and internals remain unchanged, the S1 Dazzling's top lid and wrist pad area get a subtle tech/magic makeover.

 Using polychromatic photoisomer, in its White Moon color, the monochrome surface of the S1 can reveal colors when exposed to UV light. To demo this for us, they shined a UV flashlight over the surface for a few seconds to reveal "MEGABOOK S1" written in pixel font along the right side of the top lid. First seen on the Camon 19 Pro Mondrian Edition smartphone which launched last year, Tecno is expanding this technology to their other devices.

 While the effect wasn't as pronounced inside during their booth presentation, I imagine longer exposure to the sun would really highlight this change in appearance. Additionally, while this remains a concept product and pricing hasn't been announced, we suspect that Techno is looking to bring its unique technology in at a similar affordable starting price point as the standard Megabook S1\. It's unclear what customization users will have over the displayed text or designs, though just as with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 with its AniMe Matrix Display on its lid, the S1 Dazzling Edition will likely find its fan base.
