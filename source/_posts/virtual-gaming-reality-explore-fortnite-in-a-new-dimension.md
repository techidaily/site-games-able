 Fortnite is undeniably one of the most beloved video games, but you may have noticed it's missing on the App Store. But there's still a way to play Fortnite on your iPhone, thanks to Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service.

## Download GeForce Now on Your iPhone

 Getting GeForce Now on your iPhone isn't as straightforward as [downloading an app from the App Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-apps-from-app-store/) . Nvidia has opted for a different approach, implementing a mobile web app instead. Here's how you can access it on your iPhone:

1. Launch Safari and head over to [Nvidia's GeForce Now install page](https://play.geforcenow.com/mall/#/install) .
2. Tap the**Share** button at the bottom.
3. Scroll down and select**Add to Home Screen** .
4. Tap**Add** in the top-right corner.

Close

 Now, you'll see GeForce Now on your iPhone's Home Screen. You can open it just like any other app.
