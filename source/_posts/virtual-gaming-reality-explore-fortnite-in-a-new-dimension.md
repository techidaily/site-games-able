 Fortnite is undeniably one of the most beloved video games, but you may have noticed it's missing on the App Store. But there's still a way to play Fortnite on your iPhone, thanks to Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service.

## Download GeForce Now on Your iPhone

 Getting GeForce Now on your iPhone isn't as straightforward as [downloading an app from the App Store](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-apps-from-app-store/) . Nvidia has opted for a different approach, implementing a mobile web app instead. Here's how you can access it on your iPhone:

1. Launch Safari and head over to [Nvidia's GeForce Now install page](https://play.geforcenow.com/mall/#/install) .
2. Tap the**Share** button at the bottom.
3. Scroll down and select**Add to Home Screen** .
4. Tap**Add** in the top-right corner.

Close

 Now, you'll see GeForce Now on your iPhone's Home Screen. You can open it just like any other app.

## Sign Up for GeForce Now

 Before you can jump into a game of Fortnite, you need to sign up for an account and pick your GeForce Now membership tier. Here's how to get started:

1. Open the GeForce Now app and tap**Log In** in the top-right corner.
2. You can now log in using your choice of platform, such as Google or Discord. If you simply want to create an account using your email address, head over to**Login Help > Create Account** and fill in your details.
3. You'll now be prompted to confirm your details and enter your date of birth. After doing so, tap**Create Account** .
4. You can now choose from 3 different membership tiers, which are:  
   * **Free:** This tier gives you free access to a basic rig, with a limit of one hour per session.  
   * **Priority:** For $9.99 per month, you get priority access to servers with a limit of six hours per session. You can stream games at 1080p and 60 FPS with the option to turn on ray tracing in supported titles.  
   * **Ultimate:** For $19.99 per month, you can access servers featuring GeForce RTX 4080 rigs. This lets you play games in 4K at 120 FPS, with each session limited to eight hours.
5. Tap**Join** for your preferred membership tier and enter your billing information to proceed.

## Launch Fortnite on iPhone via GeForce Now

 Now that you've finally created a GeForce Now account, you can follow these steps to start playing Fortnite on your iPhone:

1. [Connect your controller to your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-connect-ps5-controller-to-phone/) . You can still play using touch controls if you don't have a controller.
2. On the GeForce Now home page, tap the**hamburger menu** (three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner and select**Settings** .
3. Scroll down and tap**Connect** under**Epic Games** to link your Epic Games account to GeForce Now.
4. Log in using your account credentials or create a new one.
5. Return to the GeForce Now home page. Then, tap the**search icon** at the top and type Fortnite.
6. Tap**Fortnite** and select**Play** to launch the game.

 During peak hours, you may need to wait in a queue before you can play a game using GeForce Now, especially if you're on the free tier.

 You can [use your iPhone like a handheld gaming console](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-iphone-into-gaming-console/) , particularly with GeForce Now. Besides Fortnite, you can access over 1,500 PC games directly on your iPhone.
