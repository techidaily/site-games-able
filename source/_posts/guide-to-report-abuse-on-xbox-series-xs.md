## Guide to Report Abuse on Xbox Series X/S

 Online gaming on any platform can come with its fair share of unwanted social experiences, or even online abuse. Gaming with an Xbox Series X|S is unfortunately no different. What can set each platform apart, however, is the tools and systems in place to help you avoid, navigate, and deal with inappropriate online behavior.

 If you choose the Xbox Series X|S as your console of choice, there are tons of ways of dealing with each form of inappropriate behavior you may encounter, but this can get confusing. So, if you're looking for a way to report people's behavior on Xbox, we can help.

## 1\. How to Report an Xbox Playerâ€™s Profile

 Commonly, if you experience inappropriate online behavior while playing on Xbox, you might not get the chance to report or deal with the behavior while still in your game. Luckily, the most common way of reporting other Xbox players relies on the**Recently played with** option to report the Xbox profile of the offending user.

 To report an offending Xbox player's profile on your Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to open the Guide menu.
* Navigate to**People** , and select**Recently played with** .

* Select the Xbox profile of the person who displayed inappropriate behavior.
* Choose the option for**Report or block** , followed by**Report** .

## 2\. How to Report Inappropriate Xbox Messages

 Aside from experiencing inappropriate behavior from in-game gameplay or a way associated with a player's profile, another common form of social disruption is presented through online messaging.

 Whether it's through obvious scams, rage-fuelled hate messages, or even inappropriate content, toxic messaging is ripe on Xbox Series X|S. However, your Xbox also has a direct way to deal with and report messages in particular. To specifically report messages on your Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu.
* Highlight the options for**Parties & chats** , and select**Chats** .

![A screenshot of the Parties and Chats section of the Xbox Series X Guide menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2989.jpg)

* Select the conversation that contains the inappropriate messages you received.
* Choose the**More** option at the end of the conversation history, and select**Report person** .

![A screenshot of the available options for Xbox Chats with Report Person highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2992.jpg)

 Just as with reporting an Xbox profile, you will then be able to select specific reasons for reporting the player. However, by reporting them through**Chats** , you are linking the report to the player's messages, making it more likely action will be taken.

## 3\. How to Report Inappropriate Behavior in the Xbox Activity Feed

 Much like how you can report Xbox players through messages you receive, you can also specifically report players through the content you see on the Xbox Activity Feed.

 Whether through inappropriate game captures, comments, or Xbox Clubs, the content in your Xbox Activity Feed is all reportable. So, with that in mind, if you want to report inappropriate content you find in the Xbox Activity Feed, follow these steps:

* Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu.
* Select**My games & apps** , followed by**See all** .

![A screenshot of the Apps section of My Games and Apps on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2995.jpg)

* From here, select the game capture or post you want to report.
* With the post open, choose**More actions** , followed by**Report** .

![A screenshot of the available options for a post on the Xbox Activity Feed with the ability to Report highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-3001.jpg)

 Like with any other Xbox report, you can then define the specific categories of your report and hit**Submit** to finalize it. With the report linked to an individual Xbox Activity Feed post, you can rest assured that Xbox will be able to evaluate your report with the evidence provided.

 However, your own Xbox Activity Feed content can just as easily be flagged by other users. So, it's important when you post a game capture or[create an Xbox Club](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-a-club-on-xbox-series-x-s/) that you're confident the content is appropriate.

## 4\. How to Report In-Game Voice Chat on Xbox Series X|S
