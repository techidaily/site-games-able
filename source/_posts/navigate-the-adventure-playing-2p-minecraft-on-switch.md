## Navigate the Adventure: Playing 2P Minecraft on Switch

 Playing multiplayer games with your friends is always a good time, but it can be difficult to do your own thing when you’re sharing the same screen. Usually, one player gets pulled along wherever the other wants to go, and there has to be some sort of compromise. But did you know that if you’re playing Minecraft on a console like the Nintendo Switch, you can play multiplayer split-screen?

 If you want to split your screen with up to four players locally or online and fully enjoy the freedom of Minecraft on the Nintendo Switch, here’s how.

## What Do I Need to Play Two-Player Minecraft on My Nintendo Switch?

 All you need to split your screen and start crafting away on the Switch with your friends is a Nintendo Switch console, Minecraft, and two controllers. The only hardware requirement that it takes to get split-screen multiplayer up and running is a screen that supports at least 720p, but the Switch already has that covered for you.

 Split-screen multiplayer is only available on the console version of Minecraft. That means the PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox versions only. But just because you only have Minecraft on your PC or mobile, doesn't mean you still can't get all your friends involved in creating the ultimate Minecraft world. There are many more [ways to play Minecraft with your friends](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-minecraft-with-friends/) than just this way.

## How Do I Play Two-Player Minecraft Online on My Nintendo Switch?

 Now that you have that sorted out, log into your Minecraft world with two controllers at the ready. Once you are all loaded in and ready to go, press the**+** button on player two’s controller.

 Press**+** again to confirm when you see**Join as Player 2** pop up on the screen, and you will be taken to the user selection screen. If you want to play split-screen Minecraft online, both users need a Nintendo Switch Online account. For the system to recognize your Nintendo Switch Online account, you need to log in.

 If you're already logged into your friend's Switch, select your**user** . If not, scroll to the right and press**+** to create a new user and log in with your Nintendo Switch Online account. Once you're logged in, the screen will automatically split into two, and you will both be free to craft to your heart's content on the same Nintendo Switch screen.

## How Do I Play Two-Player Minecraft Offline on My Nintendo Switch?

 If one or both of your doesn't have a Nintendo Switch Online account, you will have to play multiplayer Minecraft offline. To do this, you have to make sure that**Multiplayer** has been toggled off in the settings.

 Press**+** and scroll down to**Settings** . Select**Multiplayer** , toggle the**Multiplayer Game** setting off, and then go back to your world. Press**+** on player two’s controller, press**+** again to confirm, and enjoy Minecraft in two-player split-screen.

 Building an absolutely epic Minecraft city with your friends on split-screen multiplayer could easily take upwards of one hundred hours or more in some cases. The last thing you want is to accidentally delete that Minecraft world and erase all the hard work that went into creating it.

 Backing up anything of importance is always a great idea, so why not add your Minecraft server to that list?[Backing up and restoring deleted Minecraft worlds](https://www.makeuseof.com/minecraft-world-how-to-restore/) can be done on many different devices, but it's much easier to back your world up in the first place than struggle to restore it later. Always make sure you make a copy of your world regularly to prevent any tragic mishaps.

## Minecraft Is More Fun With a Friend

 Many things are more fun with a friend, and Minecraft is no exception. There is something so nostalgic about playing split-screen multiplayer, and this feature is only available on the console version of Minecraft, so make sure you take advantage of it next time you have a friend over and are feeling particularly creative. Many hands make light work, after all.
