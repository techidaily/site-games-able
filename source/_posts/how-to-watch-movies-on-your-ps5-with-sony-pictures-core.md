## What Is Sony Pictures Core?

 Sony Pictures Core (previously known as Bravia Core) is a movie streaming service you can get on PS4 or PS5 consoles. Sony Pictures Core contains a massive library of up to 2,000 movies from Sony Pictures, providing early access to some titles, behind-the-scenes content, director’s commentaries, and other exclusive offers.

 Sony Pictures Core also offers extra deals, such as discounts on seven movies for seven days or access to additional content from Crunchyroll. These deals are available for a limited time only and they can change. Head to the [PlayStation website](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/sony-pictures-core/) or the [Sony Pictures Core homepage](https://www.sonypicturescore.com/) to see any deals currently on offer.

 These are the highest tiers available for PS Plus. But to rent or buy the average movie on Sony Pictures Core, you’re looking at paying around $3.99 to $15.99.

 If you’re a movie buff, those 100 free movies could make [deciding between the PS Plus Extra, Essential, and Premium/Deluxe tiers](https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-plus-essential-vs-extra-vs-premium/) a little easier, and that’s not considering the other exclusive benefits.

## How to Download and Use Sony Pictures Core on Your PS5

 Sony Pictures Core is a free app available to download on PS4 and PS5 consoles.

![the Media Tab on a PS5](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/media-tab-ps5.jpg)

 Using Sony Pictures Core requires you to enable the HDCP settings on your PlayStation.[HDCP is different to HDMI](https://www.makeuseof.com/hdcp-vs-hdmi-whats-the-difference/) . It stands for High-Bandwidth Digital Copyright/Content Protection, and it prevents you from being able to stream or record content while you’re watching it on the app.

If not, an error screen will appear, prompting you to enable the settings before you can use the app. To enable HDCP, select**Go to HDMI** . Your PlayStation will direct you to the exact setting you need to change.
