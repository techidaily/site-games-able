## Unlocking New Fun Levels: Board Games and Card Gaming in Discord

### Key Takeaways

* Discord Activities are built-in multiplayer games and activities to spice up your server, making connections more engaging.
* Easily start or join activities with a click, accessing various options suitable for different preferences.
* Activities can be enjoyed with friends, enhancing conversations and interactions within your Discord channel.

 Discord Activities are built-in multiplayer games and experiences designed to add a layer of entertainment and interactivity to your Discord server, making it a more engaging place to connect with friends and fellow members. Here's how you can use them.

## What Are Discord Activities?

 Discord Activities are simple interactive games that you can play within Discord's interface. There are over a dozen activities to choose from, including Chess in the Park, which allows you to challenge a friend to a quick game of chess, and Watch Together, which lets you watch YouTube with a friend without worrying about being out of sync.

 Discord Activities offer a variety of options that cater to everyone's preferences, whether you're looking for a quick distraction or a longer, more engaging activity. Since they're built into Discord, you don't need anything other than Discord to run these activities. In addition, they're lightweight and web-hosted, so you don't need an expensive computer to run them.

 If it's your first time using Discord and you want to get a hold of your surroundings first, we recommend you read our guide on[getting started with Discord](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-started-discord-beginners-guide/) .

 These activities are perfect for spending time with your friends, as they give you something to do together while you talk, and add a new level of entertainment to your conversations.

## How to Start a Discord Activity

 Activities are easily accessible within any voice channel or direct message. Call up a friend or join a voice channel, and then tap the rocket ship icon under**Voice Connected** .

## How to Join an Existing Activity on a Discord Channel

 It's not always the case that you're the host of a Discord activity. If someone else has started an activity, you can join them with a few clicks. Just join a Discord call or voice channel where your friend is hosting an activity. You can see if there is an ongoing activity next to the channel title.

 Once in, click**Join Activity** to join them. If you haven't previously authorized the activity, click**Authorize** to get it started. If you're looking for people to play with, try[joining one of the best Discord servers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-find-best-discord-servers/) .

 With a wide variety of options and cross-platform compatibility, activities add a new dimension to your Discord experience.
