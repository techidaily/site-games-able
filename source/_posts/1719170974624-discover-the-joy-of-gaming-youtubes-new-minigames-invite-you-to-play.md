 Many of these games have been developed by well-known game developers, such as FRVR, Nitro Games, Vodoo, Aim Lab, Famobi, and Arkadium. And since some of these developers are popular for their free HMTL5 games, you can actually play some of the games listed above outside YouTube Playables through the game developer’s official website or through third-party sites like [HTML5 Games](https://html5games.com/) .

## Who Can Play Playables on YouTube?

 Playables is an experimental feature within YouTube. Since [only YouTube Premium members can test experimental features](https://www.makeuseof.com/youtube-premium-test-experimental-features/) , the mini-games are only available to YouTube Premium subscribers. This also means that those with YouTube Kids accounts cannot access this section despite the child-friendly nature of all the mini-games within the collection.

 If you are [deciding whether YouTube Premium is worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/youtube-red-worth-money-things-need-consider/) to access Playables and all the other premium features, we suggest that you skip the annual subscription and get the monthly subscription instead. This is because the Playables feature will only be available until March 28, 2024\. If it doesn’t become a feature after that date, it may get canceled entirely.

 Alternatively, you can simply keep scrolling through the YouTube homepage past**Shorts** and**Breaking news** until you see the**Playables on YouTube** section. You can then click any of the 40 mini-games available to start playing.

## Testing YouTube Playables

 Just like YouTube, Netflix and TikTok have also added mini-games as part of their platforms. What YouTube does differently is requiring no download or installation to play its mini-games. This level of convenience could attract more casual gamers to YouTube, which may boost user engagement and time spent on the platform.

 Depending on how Playables perform, we may see more platforms implementing mini-games into their services. Or the experiment could fail miserably.
