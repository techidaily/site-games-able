## Top-Ranked Gear for an Elite Steam Deck Experience

 The Steam Deck might look like a handheld console like the Nintendo Switch, but in reality, it's more of a mobile PC. And, as with any PC, you can hook the Steam Deck up to a monitor and even add a keyboard and mouse, making it a fully-fledged computer that you can carry around with you.

 The only downside to the Steam Deck is that it runs Linux instead of Windows, meaning you might have some compatibility issues with certain keyboards or mice. However, other accessories like microSD cards and Bluetooth headphones all work on the Steam Deck without any problems.

Here are the best Steam Deck accessories available today.

##### SABRENT Rocket 2230 NVMe 4.0 1TB SSD

Best Overall

 Keep all your favorite titles with you wherever you go

 With 1TB of storage and exceptional performance, the SABRENT Rocket 2230 NVMe 4.0 SSD is one of the best storage solutions for your Steam Deck. Enjoy ultra-fast responsiveness, with less power draw and greater heat dissipation.

**Pros**

* 1TB of storage
* Improved performance
* Installation is relatively simple

**Cons**

* Expensive for what it is

[$100 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Rocket-2230-Performance-SB-2130-1TB/dp/B0BQG6JCRP?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2009249&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-steam-deck-accessories%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$110 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SABRENT-Rocket-2230-NVMe-4-0-1TB-High-Performance-PCIe-4-0-M-2-2230-SSD-SB-2130-1TB/1902686277)

 One of the major gripes with the Steam Deck and handheld PCs, in general, is the relative lack of storage space for your game library. With 512GB the most on offer, you might struggle for space if you’re planning to play AAA titles on the go. By investing in a decent SSD like the SABRENT Rocket 2230, you can expand your storage space by a much more generous 1TB.

 As well as the considerable expansion to your storage space, it offers read speeds of 4750 MB/s and write speeds of 4300 MB/s, which provides fast and reliable performance for your games. This solid-state drive is highly efficient and will dramatically reduce the heat output on your console, too.

 The SABRENT Rocket 2230 is an excellent investment if you want to play larger, more demanding titles on your Steam Deck. It’s good value for money, considering the acreage that you’re getting, and installing it is a relatively simple process as well. All-in-all, it’s a very worthwhile buy to get the most out of your handheld.

 The battery life runs for up to 30 hours, making these headphones ideal for portable gaming sessions. Did we mention that the sound quality is incredible, too? And although the Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones will set you back almost as much as a Steam Deck does, they are a feature-rich option that is guaranteed to boost your gameplay.
