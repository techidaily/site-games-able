### Key Takeaways

* Amazon Prime subscribers get one free Twitch subscription per month, saving them from paying for it separately.
* To use the free Twitch subscription, first activate Prime Gaming, then link your Twitch and Prime Gaming accounts.
* Once the accounts are linked, go to a streamer's channel and use the free subscription option.

 Supporting your favorite Twitch streamers by subscribing to their channels can be an expensive hobby. But if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you get one Twitch subscription for free every month. If you want to use your free Twitch sub but aren't sure how to redeem it, here's everything you need to know.

## 1\. Enable Prime Gaming

 To unlock the ability to use your one free Twitch channel subscription per month, you first have to subscribe to Amazon Prime. From there, you will have to head to [the Prime Gaming website](http://gaming.amazon.com/) to activate Prime Gaming.

 To activate Prime Gaming, sign in to the website using your Amazon Prime account details by clicking on the**Sign In** button at the top right of the page. Once signed in, press the**Activate Prime Gaming** button in the top right corner of the screen and select**Add your mobile number** .

 You will then be taken to your main Amazon account page, where you will be prompted to enter your phone number.

![Add Mobile to Enable Prime Gaming](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/add-mobile-to-enable-prime-gaming.jpg)

 Amazon will send a six-digit code to the number you entered. Type the code into the**text box** to confirm your phone number, and make sure to press**Done** at the bottom of the page before heading back to the Prime Gaming website.

![Press Done to Confirm Amazon Account Changes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/press-done-to-confirm-amazon-account-changes.jpg)

 Below the link to change your phone number, you will see another link labeled**Refresh this page** . Press that to activate your Prime Gaming account.

## 2\. Link Your Twitch and Prime Gaming Accounts

 Now that your Prime Gaming account has been activated, you are ready to move on to the next step, which is to link your Twitch and Prime Gaming accounts. To do so, head back to the Prime Gaming website.

 Select your**account name** in the top right corner of the screen and select**Link Twitch account** .

 This will open a popup, so select**Link accounts** to get started. Enter your Twitch account details into the**login box** , and enter the six-digit code that will be sent to the email address associated with your Twitch account.

 Press**Confirm** to link your Twitch account to your Prime Gaming account.

## 3\. How to Use Your Free Twitch Sub With Amazon Prime

 There are a few hoops to jump through to gain access to your monthly Twitch Subscription with Prime Gaming, but now that you’ve completed the above steps, you’re ready to claim it.

 To finally use your free sub, head to the [Twitch website](https://www.twitch.tv/) and open your favorite streamer's channel.

 At the bottom right of the stream window, you will see a box labeled**Subscribe** . Select that to bring up the subscription window.

![Subscribe Button Location on Twitch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/subscribe-button-location-on-twitch.jpg)

 A regular subscription to a Twitch channel costs $4.99/month, which you will see in the bottom right of the subscription window.

 If you have a free Prime Gaming sub, however, a checkbox labeled**Use Prime Sub** will be present. Check that box to redeem your free monthly Twitch subscription and select**Subscribe with Prime** to confirm.

![Use Prime Sub Button on Twitch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/use-prime-sub-button-on-twitch.jpg)

 The checkbox will only be available if Twitch subscriptions are allowed in your country, you have already activated Prime Gaming, the channel you are trying to subscribe to is a Twitch Affiliate or Partner, and you haven’t used your free subscription for the month.

 If any of these conditions aren’t met, the option won't be available to you.

 Once you have successfully used your Prime Gaming sub, you can view and [manage your Twitch subscriptions](https://www.makeuseof.com/manage-twitch-subscriptions/) on the website.

 Free things are always hard to pass up, and since subscriptions are what keep Twitch, and its streamers going, your one free sub every month with Prime is easily one of the most [important Twitch features that every user should know about](https://www.makeuseof.com/twitch-features-every-user-should-know/) .

 An Amazon Prime subscription not only provides you with many shows and movies to watch but also gives you the chance to support your favorite creators for free.

 Subscriptions build up, and you no doubt have a growing list of monthly payments to subscription services already. But at least with Amazon Prime, you can scratch one Twitch subscription fee off your list each month.
