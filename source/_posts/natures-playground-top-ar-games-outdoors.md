 Draconius GO is basically the same as Pok√©mon Go, but it is better suited for those who want to find and capture majestic dragons and other mythical creatures as they get active outdoors.

 The objective of the game is straightforward‚Äîgo outside to explore the map and find eggs to collect and hatch. Who knows, you might find anything from a rare, winged Basilisk to an adorable Berrydillo.

 Stepping outdoors is not only limited to daylight hours. Spending some time outside at nighttime is also beneficial for your physical and mental well-being. Use the Star Walk 2 app to embrace the dark and learn more about the stars above you in the night sky.

 Star Walk 2 is a stunning mobile app that is easy to use with a clear premise.

You can then tap on the images in space to view 3D models or to learn more information.

 Just like the majority of AR mobile games, in order to play Ingress Prime you have to walk around and explore the real-world map and different locations. That makes it a perfect way to enjoy some fresh air outside and get moving. But with portals, XM particles, and various high-tech weapons, Ingress Prime is the ultimate game for those who love a good science fiction story.

 To begin playing Ingress Prime you have to first choose a faction‚ÄîThe Enlightened or The Resistance. Once you've selected a side, you can collect XM to power your actions throughout the game, take part in fun missions in your local area, or hack portals to collect more items.

**Download:** Ingress Prime for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ingress-prime/id576505181) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029750/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress) (Free, in-app purchases and subscription available)

 If you're looking for an AR mobile game that is unlike any other, then you need to try Orna. While it is similar to other AR games because you have to move in real life to move in the in-game world map, what makes Orna unique is that it is based on old, classic-style RPG adventure games.

 The game offers over 50 character classes to choose from whether you want to play as a sorcerer, a druid, or a thief. Build up your weapons, spells, and defense to beat other players in the world around you, and then collect experience and new items. Even better, you can take part in a range of enchanting events and quests.

 Not only is Pikmin Bloom a super cute AR mobile game, but it is relaxing, too. The game works using a step counter or GPS tracking on your phone and the basis is to gather seedlings, bloom flowers, and lots more.

 Each Pikmin creature is a blend of an animal and a plant which makes them incredibly cute and also fun to collect. The trick is that you need to keep moving to grow your seedlings. So the more time you spend walking around outdoors, the more adorable Pikmin you can pluck and have to walk around with you.
