## Discount Heaven: 11 Sites for Finding Cheap Video Games

 Although video games provide great value-per-dollar for entertainment, gaming can be an expensive hobby. Those purchases add up, and it's easy to spend upwards of $1,000 in a year.

 Fortunately, if your budget is tight, you have ways to cut back. First, stop pre-ordering games. You could even take it one step further and avoid buying new games altogether.

 However, the best idea of all is to wait for deals. You'll need some patience, and you won't always get to play the games you want right away, but video game deals can save you lots of money. To help you out, you should use game discount sites to help you find great deals on games.

With that in mind, here are the best sites to buy cheap video games.

## 1. IsThereAnyDeal

![IsThereAnyDeal](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/is-there-any-deal.jpg)

 IsThereAnyDeal is a deal comparison site for video games. It not only aggregates pretty much every video game deal currently available, but lists them all side-by-side and ranks them by how much you can save. Just search for the game you want, then view all the deals on its page.

 Other nifty features include the ability to set a price point and get alerted when the price drops below it, and to view the game's price history to assess whether the current price is really a deal.

 If price is your only criterion, then this site is what you need. But IsThereAnyDeal also lists stores selling the game without deals. This allows you to use the site as a "where can I buy this game?" tool, regardless of deals.

## 2. CheapShark

![cheapshark](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cheapshark.jpg)

 CheapShark only aggregates video game prices from a dozen or so online retailers, but lets you search for any game and gives you a quick comparison of what it costs at each one.

 Handily, the site shows a game's lowest price ever and when that price occurred, and lets you set a price point to receive an alert when the game drops below it.

 CheapShark's deals listing page has an interesting sorting measure called Deal Rating. It considers various factors (e.g., absolute price, percent off, Metascore, release date) to determine how good the deal is.

## 3. GG.deals

![gg deals](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gg-deals.jpg)

 GG.deals is a PC game price comparison website that ensures you're getting the best deal. It compares prices across official stores and key shops, taking into consideration any active promo codes. It also lets you know whether the game is included as part of any subscription service, like Ubisoft+ or Xbox Game Pass.

 Not only that, but GG.deals tracks the historical price of a game so that you can ensure you're genuinely getting a good deal. In fact, sometimes you might not have to spend a dime, since the site also notifies you when a service is giving a game away free.

## 4. Humble Bundle

![humble bundle](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/humble-bundle.jpg)

 Humble Bundle started in 2010 as a discounted collection of video games, with some proceeds donated to charity. Its first few bundles consisted of mainly indie games, but it has since evolved to include AAA titles and other more desirable games.

 Humble Bundles are known for the "pay what you want" approach, which means you can grab lots of games very affordably. However, some of the most desirable titles are only available if you spend a minimum amount.

 You can also browse[the Humble Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34649/https://www.humblebundle.com/store) for regular sales. Either way, these two options comprise some of the best ways to save money and get cheap games.
