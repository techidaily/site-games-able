## Unlocking Game Speed in Roblox: A Review

 Do you struggle to get high FPS in Roblox, and your gameplay keeps lagging most of the time? If so, you should try boosting the FPS by closing other resource-intensive processes, optimizing your in-game display settings, getting a more stable internet connection, and upgrading your system hardware.

 If these attempts don't improve your FPS, you can try a less-known method to make Roblox run faster: using a Roblox FPS Unlocker.

 Below, we'll describe what the FPS unlocker is, how you can set it up, and whether it is safe to use.

## What Is Roblox FPS Unlocker, and How Does It Work?

 Roblox caps the FPS at 60 by default. That means that no matter how powerful your device is, the frame rate won't surpass 60; it will always remain around this mark. If you are used to playing games at high frames per second, 60 FPS may not provide the experience you want.

 The Roblox FPS unlocker is designed to unlock this limitation, allowing the FPS to go higher than 60\. With this limitation removed, you might be able to get more than 100 frames per second, depending on how powerful your device is. Consequently, you will notice a significant performance boost. (Check out an in-depth explanation of[what FPS means in gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-fps-meaning/) )

 The Roblox FPS Unlocker removes the frame rate cap that prevents Roblox from going beyond 60 FPS. So, it's only useful if your device is powerful enough to deliver more than 60 frames per second. Otherwise, using the unlocker would be pointless.

5. Restart Roblox.

 Once you follow these steps, hopefully, you won't be restricted to 60 FPS anymore, and it will go as high as your device is capable of.
