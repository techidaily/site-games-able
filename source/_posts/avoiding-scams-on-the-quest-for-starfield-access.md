## Avoiding Scams on the Quest for Starfield Access

 The long wait for Starfield is almost over, and Bethesda's open-world RPG is landing on the shelves of your local games store on September 6th, 2023\. But if you just can’t wait until then, there is a way you can get your hands on Starfield early.

 While it’s no secret that using the following method will allow you to play Starfield five days ahead of its official release date, there is a chance you might not have heard about it yet. So if you want to know how to get Starfield early, keep reading.

## What Is Starfield?

 Starfield needs no introduction for many of you. But just in case you have been living under a rock for the past few weeks or months, Starfield is one of the most highly anticipated video game releases for 2023.

 To say it looks incredible is a bit of an understatement. If you thought open-world games were amazing, Starfield is more of an open-universe adventure with over one thousand unique planets to explore throughout the galaxy.

 Starfield was originally scheduled for release in 2022, but after being delayed for over a year, it is finally coming to Xbox Series consoles and Windows-based PCs on the 6th of September. If you, like many other Starfield fans, just can’t wait until then, how does September 1st sound?

## Where to Get Starfield Early

 You can get your hands on Starfield five days early, but it will cost you. The only way you can get it before the original release date is to preorder a special edition. You do have options, though, which is nice.

 To get early access to Starfield, you have to purchase one of the following editions of the game:

1. [Starfield Premium Edition](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/starfield-premium-edition/9NLGBHLSWXM8/0017) —digital only ($99.99).
2. [Starfield Premium Edition Upgrade](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/starfield-premium-edition-upgrade/9PB4ZWV7S2MG/0017) ($34.99).
3. [Starfield Constellation Edition](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/get-starfield) ($299.99).

 Each of the above offers is expensive, but they come with lots of extra bells and whistles. Sadly, the Constellation Edition is a little harder to find as preorders sold out in most places almost immediately after it was announced, but both the Premium Edition and Premium Edition Upgrade are still available on the Xbox website.

 One thing to note before making your purchase is that Starfield is available on Game Pass day one. So if you have that, the Premium Edition Upgrade could be the way to go for you. That way, you can get the game early, get the story expansion, skins, and other benefits, while still being able to enjoy the game on Game Pass. If you don't have Xbox Game Pass yet, but you want to play incredible games like Starfield on day one, you can [manage your subscriptions from your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manage-xbox-subscriptions-from-xbox-series-x-s/) itself.

## How to Preorder Starfield

 The Xbox website is very user-friendly, so preordering your special edition of Starfield will only take a few minutes. Start by heading to [xbox.com](https://xbox.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account. If you have Game Pass and are planning on picking up the Starfield Premium Upgrade, make sure you sign in and make your purchase with the same account you use for Game Pass.

 Type Starfield in the search bar and select what edition you would like to buy from the drop-down menu.

## Let the Exploration Begin on September 1st

 It has been such a long wait for Starfield, especially after the delay. But as disappointing as it is when a game gets delayed, it just means that the final product you play in the end is going to be much better, and that’s never a bad thing.

 Unfortunately, you’re not going to be able to get your hands on Starfield months or even weeks in advance, but five days early is certainly better than nothing. And the bragging rights alone make preordering the premium editions of this highly anticipated title well worth the price.
