### 4\. Uninstall Problematic Extensions

 You can install all sorts of extensions in Google Chrome to improve your productivity. However, some extensions may do more harm than good.

 Facebook games may not load because of interference from an installed extension. To check for this possibility,[turn off all extensions in Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) and then try to play the games.

![Extenstions page of Chrome](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/extenstions-page.jpg)

 If they load and run properly with all extensions disabled, then one of the extensions you disabled was causing the problem. To narrow down that extension, start enabling extensions one at a time until the problem reappears.

 Once you have identified the problematic extension, you can download any available updates for it or consider uninstalling it.

### 5\. Update Google Chrome

 If Facebook games are still not loading, there is probably an issue with the Chrome version you are currently using. The solution, in this case, is to[download any available Google Chrome updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-chrome-firefox-edge-desktop-mobile/) .
