## PlayStation DualSense Masterclass 2024

 One-handed gaming keyboards are a great choice for PC and console gamers who want to customize their gaming setup to allow for more fluid and responsive gameplay. Not only do gaming keypads take up far less space than conventional keyboards, but many of them provide a greater level of customization with custom keymapping and macro configuration functions.

### Q: What is a gaming keypad?

 A gaming keypad is a small auxiliary keyboard designed for a more fluid gameplay experience. Typically, they include remappable key and macro functions and enable storage for several custom player profiles so that you can tailor your gameplay to suit different titles.

### Q: Is a gaming keypad better than a keyboard and mouse?

 Some gamers prefer a more traditional keyboard and mouse setup, particularly when it comes to fast-paced games, such as FPS titles.

 However, a gaming keypad can save some valuable real estate on your desk and give you additional options to customize your player profiles for different games. Plus, their construction tends to be a little more robust than with a full-size keyboard, which can make them more suitable for the rough and tumble of squad-based shooters or PvP matches.

### Q: Is a gaming keypad better than a controller?

 This is always going to boil down to personal preference and what type of games you like to play. But undoubtedly, gaming keypads offer more in terms of precision and customization than a controller will. This puts them at a distinct advantage when it comes to more complex titles, such as MMOs, when multiple button functions and commands are necessary.

 Even if you fork out for a customizable game controller, you will typically find these to be considerably more expensive than most gaming keypads and with comparatively less functionality, too.

### Q: Do pro gamers use gaming keypads?

 The majority of pro gamers favor traditional keyboard and mouse gameplay, as this enables the quickest reaction times for intense and fast-paced competitive gameplay.

### Q: Are gaming keypads helpful for MMOs?

 Gaming keypads make a great choice for MMOs and FPSs, as they provide a means to perform multiple actions at once. They usually feature a suite of customization options, from programmable macros to custom player profiles, so that you can tailor your experience to different titles. For MMOs, in particular, a gaming keypad can be a real advantage, thanks to their smaller profile (compared to a full-sized keyboard) and the depth of control and customization that they offer.
