## Seamless Xbox Viewing on a Secondary Laptop Screen

 Using your Windows laptop as a screen for your Xbox Series X|S is simple. And it's an ideal solution if you don't have a dedicated monitor, or your laptop's screen is higher quality than your existing monitor.

 If you connect via Remote Play, this also has the advantage of allowing you to play Xbox games anywhere you like. The only caveat is that your laptop must be able to connect to your console via the Internet.

## What Is Remote Play?

 Remote Play lets you stream your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S to any eligible device. This includes PCs, Android, and iOS devices; see[how to play Xbox games on your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-xbox-games-iphone-ipad/) as an example. You'll be able to use your console exactly as you would normally.

 It's worth being aware of the differences between Xbox Remote Play and Xbox Cloud Gaming. When opening your Xbox or the Xbox app for PC, you will see an option titled**Cloud Gaming** . This requires an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and allows you to stream Xbox games to your devices without an Xbox console.

## How to Enable Remote Play on Your Xbox Series X|S

 While Remote Play can always be used as long as you have a wireless connection to your Xbox, you'll get the best performance by ensuring you meet the following requirements:

* A laptop updated to Windows 10 or Windows 11 (v.1903+).
* 5Ghz Wi-Fi.
* Less than 60ms Network latency.
* An upload bandwidth of more than 9Mbps.
* A wired network connection.
* Ensuring the**Power options** on your Xbox are set to**Sleep** .

 If your laptop and Xbox are both on the same network, you won't need to worry too much about the network settings. However, if you are playing on a different network, you may experience noticeable network lag if you drop too far below these settings.

### How to Set Up Your Xbox for Remote Play

 With the preferred requirements for Remote Play outlined you need to make sure your Xbox has Remote Play enabled. Follow these steps to get ready for Remote Play:

1. Press the**Xbox button** to open the Guide menu.
2. Highlight the options for**Profile & system** , and select**Settings** .  
![A screenshot of the Guide menu on Xbox Series X with the options for Profile and System highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-guide-menu.jpg)
3. Under**Devices & connections** , choose**Remote features** .

![A screenshot of the Devices and Connections options for an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/remote-features.jpg)
4. Ensure the option for**Enable remote features** is selected.

![A screenshot of the Remote Features settings on Xbox Series X with Enable Remote Features highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/enable-remote-features.jpg)

 From here, you should see a checkmark next to**Enable remote features** , and your Xbox will take a few moments to test your setup and suggest ways remote play can be improved.

 You may be required to change your**Xbox app preferences** to**Allow from any device** or**Only from profiles signed in on this Xbox** to enable Remote Play features.

![A screenshot of the settings for Xbox App Preferences on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xbox-app-preferences.jpg)

 Similarly, you can also select**Power options** from the**Remote features** screen, to[customize the power settings of your Xbox](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-customize-xbox-series-x-s-power-options-to-save-energy/) and ensure it is set to**Sleep** rather than**Shutdown** to enable Remote Play all the time.

## How to Start Playing Xbox Series X|S Games With Your Laptop

 While you don't technically need an Xbox controller for this, we recommend using an official controller to get the best experience. If you're not using an Xbox Series X|S controller, you might not be able to use Bluetooth to connect your controller to your laptop. In that case, you'll need to use a different method to[sync your controller with your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/) .

### Connect Your Xbox Controller to Your Laptop

 If you're playing near your Xbox, you won't need to do anything here. Your controller will connect directly to your Xbox Series X|S. Otherwise, follow these steps to connect your Xbox controller to your laptop:

1. On your laptop, open the**Settings** app.
2. Click**Devices** , followed by**Add Bluetooth or other device** .  
![A screenshot of the Bluetooth and Other Devices Settings on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/windows-bluetooth-and-other-devices-1.jpg)
3. From the**Add a device** screen, select**Bluetooth** .
4. Turn on your Xbox controller and press the Pair button at the top of the controller.
5. Click**Xbox Wireless Controller** when it appears on the**Add a device** screen.  
![A screenshot of the Add a Device page available in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/windows-add-a-device-1.jpg)

 With your laptop successfully paired with your controller, you're ready to use it with Remote Play. However, if you're having trouble pairing over Bluetooth, you can connect your laptop to your controller using a wired USB-C cable. This will instantaneously sync your devices.

## How to Download the Xbox App and Connect to Your Xbox

 With your controller ready to go, you'll need to install[the Xbox app for PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) on your laptop. Once you've installed it, sign in with the same Microsoft account you use for your Xbox, and perform the following:

1. Open the Xbox app on your laptop.
2. Click the**Consoles** button in the top-left of your screen.
3. Click your Xbox. Your Xbox will now connect to your laptop.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![A screenshot of the Console list within the Xbox App for PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-2815.jpg)

 After a brief loading screen, you'll be greeted with the Xbox Cloud Gaming startup screen. From here, you can interact with your Xbox in the exact same way you would with your controller.

 However, by clicking the**three-button menu** in the top-left of your screen with your mouse, you can access helpful options. These include**Mute** ,**Feedback** ,**Toggle fullscreen** , and**Disconnect** .

![A screenshot of the streaming options for Remote Play for an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xbox-stream-options.jpg)

 As long as your Xbox is set to**Sleep** , you won't even need to turn your Xbox on first. Just connect to your Xbox via the Xbox app, and your console will turn on remotely. So if you're on a train, on vacation, or even on a break at work, you can play games from your console.

## What Else Can the Xbox App Do?

 If you've only used the Xbox app for PC for Remote Play, you should know this is only a tiny part of its functionality.

![cloud gaming screen of xbox app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/xbox-app-cloud-gaming.jpg)

 The Xbox app primarily serves as the platform for Xbox PC gaming. You can shop for new Xbox games, interact with the Xbox community, and[take advantage of Xbox Game Pass](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-to-get-xbox-game-pass/) . Even if your laptop isn't powerful enough to run the newest AAA titles, you can play games via Cloud Gaming.

## You're Now Ready to Use Remote Play on Your Laptop

 As previously discussed, Remote Play is available on more than just PC. You can install the Xbox app on iOS and Android devices, so you can play wherever your phone is. However, you might want a stand to hold your phone because you'll need a controller to play.

 If you don't have a console or want to play with a friend who doesn't have one, you'll want to give Xbox Cloud Gaming a shot. You don't even need an official Xbox controller for this, just a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
