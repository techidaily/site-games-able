## Transform Your XBox Experience - Better Blue-Ray

 Gaming consoles are innately gaming-orientated, but if you own an Xbox Series X, its Blu-ray drive can turn your Xbox into a great media player. And, while you have to rely on the Xbox Blu-ray player application, you can fine-tune your consoles to get the most out of your Blu-rays.

 On Xbox Series X, you can alter dedicated settings and processes to craft and improve your Blu-ray experience on the platform. But what exactly are these Blu-ray improving settings, and how can you access them? Let's find out.

## The Ways Your Xbox Can Enhance Playing Blu-rays

 Using your Xbox Series X as a Blu-ray player may appear less convenient than using a dedicated device designed for that very purpose. But the supported Blu-ray features on your Xbox can at least help close the gap between consoles and media players.

 To be specific, the following features from your Xbox Series X can help to improve your experience of Blu-rays:

* Decoding Audio—This allows you to control what audio can be heard while playing Blu-rays on your Xbox. This way, you can choose whether to silence unwanted intrusions from things like Xbox notifications.
* Dolby Digital Dynamic Range Control - Your Xbox also allows you to set preferences for Dolby Digital sound and audio. With Dynamic Range Control, you can balance out the audio of your Blu-rays to prevent any peaks or troughs of sound.
* Enabling BD Live—BD Live support allows all the digital content of your Blu-rays to be accessed on your Xbox. Even content provided digitally by movie studios, like trailers and behind-the-scenes clips, can be accessed via BD Live.

 And aside from the dedicated Blu-ray settings and features, you can also[enable closed captioning on your Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-closed-captions-xbox-series-x/) using other experience-supporting features of the console. Closed captioning, however, will only work for supported games or media.But with the above Xbox Blu-ray settings, you can universally alter and improve your experience of Blu-rays on your Series X. But how do you actually access and use these features?
