## Discover Premier Tech - IFA's Lineup

### Key Takeaways

* AWOL introduces the Vision Vanish Laser TV, a high-end unit with a retracting screen and a 100 or 120-inch screen size with 3D and MEMC technology.
* Hisense offers 200-inch Laser TVs with two short-throw projectors that seamlessly combine into a single ultra-wide screen.
* Lenovo introduces the ThinkVision 3D monitor, a 27-inch display that gives users 3D vision without the need for glasses and features eye-tracking technology.

 TVs and monitors are one of the most common consumer purchases for households. So manufacturers are taking advantage of IFA—one of the world's biggest consumer electronics and appliances shows—held annually in Berlin.

 So, what has IFA 2023 turned up for entertainment aficionados? Let's check out the best new TVs and monitors our team has seen on the ground.

## AWOL Vision Vanish Laser TV
![AWOL IFA 2023](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/awol-ifa-2023.jpg)

 The trends in TV screen size are increasing year-by-year—[according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/961283/united-states-average-tv-screen-size/) , the average TV size in the US was 38 inches in 2012, rising to 50 inches by 2022\. However, as TV sizes increase, they occupy more space, even when you're not using them.

 So, to help address this, AWOL introduced the Vision Vanish Laser TV. This unit incorporates a laser TV projector, a retracting screen, and a smart cabinet holding it all together. All this comes out to a 100 or 120-inch screen with 3D and [MEMC technology](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-memc-does-your-smartphone-need-it/) .

 By putting this all together, you get a high-end that features 3,500 NASI lumens brightness with HDR 10+ support and 36-watt Dolby-compatible speakers. It also has a 4K resolution, and the company claims that the screen's lag is only 30ms when gaming mode is activated, making it an excellent gaming display.

## Hisense 200-Inch Laser TVs

 If you need to go larger than 120 inches, your next best option is Hisense's 200-inch Laser TVs. This device features two short-throw projectors that seamlessly combine in a single 200-inch screen.

 What's impressive about this technology is how it seamlessly combines the output of two laser projectors into a single ultra-wide screen. However, we don't have much information beyond that, so we're still waiting on Hisense, as we're excited to learn more about it.

## Lenovo ThinkVision 3D Monitor

 We're already seeing [signs that 3D technology is making a comeback](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-glasses-free-3d-making-comeback/) in laptops. But Lenovo is taking it a step further by introducing the ThinkVIsion 3D monitor. This 27-inch display gives 3D vision to users without the need for glasses.

 This 27-inch monitor has a 4K resolution screen, but it also uses eye-tracking technology to project one-half of the screen to each eye, equating to a resolution of 1920 x 2160 per eye. But instead of projecting it outside of the monitor, the 3D image looks as if it's floating inside the screen.

## LG StanbyME Go

 Whether you're camping, on the road, or simply want to watch a movie or TV show outdoors, you're typically limited to the screen size of your smartphone or tablet. If you want anything bigger, you'll have to get a projector and go through the lengthy setup process.

 This is where the [LG StanbyMe Go](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F7251228%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUmuoUeUpU2029704%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-27lx5qkna) —a full HD 27-inch portable TV that comes in its own briefcase. And even though it's a portable device, it comes with all the bells and whistles of full-sized smart TVs. You get Apple TV+, Max, Disney+, Paramount+, Prime Video, Spotify, YouTube TV, and more. It also has a four-channel speaker system, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi compatibility.

 The screen also rotates, allowing you to view your content in landscape and portrait mode. And, with its built-in battery, you can enjoy your shows and movies wherever you are.

## TCL Premium QD-Mini LED TV

 Although Samsung and LG dominate the TV markets, it doesn't mean that other brands aren't trying to capture a bigger slice of the pie. TCL is the third biggest brand globally, capturing over 11% of the market,[according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266988/global-leading-manufacturers-tv-market-share-sales-volume/) .

 So, to help it increase its market share, TCL is introducing its [TCL X955 QD-Mini LED 4K TV](https://www.tcl.com/global/en/tvs/x955) , offered in 85 or 98 inches. This large TV offers 5,000 local dimming zones and HDR 5000, allowing you to see your content in the best and brightest colors.

 It also has several smart features, like Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. It also has Google TV and Google Assistant and is compatible with FreeSync Premium Pro. With all these, you get all the premium features you expect from a high-end TV at a more affordable price point.

## TCL Gaming Monitors

 Although TCL is known for its TVs, it's also now jumping into gaming monitors. Although we don't have much information about them, TCL showed off two new displays—a 27-inch 144Hz flat monitor and a 34-inch 170hz 1500R curved ultrawide monitor.

 Both displays feature a 97% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage and display HDR400, ensuring you get the most accurate colors. Their stands also feature tilt, swivel, and height functions, while the 34-inch model also pivots, allowing you to use it in either portrait or landscape views.

 You also get one DisplayPort 1.4, two HDMI 2.1 ports, a Type-C port with 90W USB-PD ([what is USB-PD?](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/usb-pd-power-delivery-charger/) ), a headphone jack, two built-in speakers, and KVM functionality. With all these features, you'll get everything you want in a gaming monitor and then some.

## Thomson Scenium OLED Transparent TV

 If you're looking for a unique statement piece in your home that could also serve as your TV, you should consider the Thomson Scenium OLED Transparent TV. This display comes in either 55 or 65 inches, with an OLED screen that's completely transparent when not in use.

 This makes the TV blend right in with your furniture when not in use. So, if you're tired of seeing an empty blank window on your wall every time you're not watching a movie or TV series and don't want to go through the hassle of hiding your TV every time you're not using it, the Thomson Scenium OLED Transparent TV will solve your problems.

## All-New TVs From IFA 2023

 IFA 2023 is one of the biggest shows in the home appliances and consumer electronics spaces, so we expect companies to show their latest offerings here—and the 99th iteration of this Berlin show did not disappoint.

 We're getting new gaming monitors, glasses-free 3D displays, portable smart TVs, large premium TVs, and laser projectors that deliver viewing screens greater than 200 inches. So, if you're looking for a new TV, monitor, or display today, there is one for you from IFA 2023.
