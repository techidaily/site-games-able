### Key Takeaways

* Remember that Connections is you versus an NYT editor, so tune into their wavelength to succeed at the game.
* Always shuffle the 16 words before making your first guess to avoid falling into any traps that have been set for you.
* Plan and execute your Connections playthrough logically, considering all the options rather than guessing blindly.

 The New York Times' Connections game is one that many people play daily. And if that includes you, you'll have no doubt experienced the absolute horror of failing to solve it occasionally. Thankfully, there are ways to increase your chances of succeeding at Connections.

 Once you know [how to play Connections](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-nyt-connections-game/) , it's time to learn some winning strategies to help you beat Connections every single day.

## 1 Remember That It's You Versus an NYT Editor

![The NYT Connections game start screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-start-screen-you-versus-editor-1.png)

 Try not to think of Connections as you battling against the puzzle itself. Instead, remember that you're locked in a battle of wills with the New York Times editor responsible for setting the game. They are the one responsible for choosing the 16 words that make up the day's Connections puzzle and the initial placement of the words.

 In a way, this makes things easier, as it means that you're battling a fellow human being. So if you can tune into the same wavelength they're operating on, you have a head start. And this is where completing Connections every day without fail proves its worth, as that's the best way of tuning into the tricks the NYT uses to throw you off.

 This tip will also help you beat [Strands, another addictive NYT game](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-strands-new-york-times-word-game/) .

## 2 Always Shuffle the Words Before Guessing

![The NYT Connections game starting position](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-no-guesses-always-shuffle.png)

 When you open Connections, you're faced with 16 words on a 4 by 4 grid. It's very easy to assume that the placement of each word is random. However, this is unlikely.

 What's more likely is that the NYT editor has chosen the placement of each word carefully in an effort to draw you into making a mistake.

 Therefore, the best policy is to shuffle the words before making your first guess. There's no harm in looking over the words before shuffling, but don't actually try to identify a group of four before clicking**Shuffle** . And if shuffling once doesn't help you see at least one potential grouping, try again.

## 3 Look for Groups of Four (but No More)

![The NYT Connections game first guess](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-first-guess-group-of-four.png)

 Everyone knows that to beat Connections you need to find four groups of four words. However, every single Connections puzzle includes more than four words that share something in common. Some words could even fit in three or more of the groups you end up with.

 Therefore, beating Connections means looking for differences as well as similarities. If you see six words that could conceivably belong to the same group, then you need to look at what divides them. Which four sit together most comfortably? Which four can only sit together without there being another possible solution?

## 4 Plan and Execute Rather Than Hit and Hope

![The NYT Connections game making a plan](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-second-guess-plan-execute.png)

 Beating Connections requires a measured approach. So don't just hit and hope, picking four words you have an idea work together. Instead, properly plan out your moves and execute them in a logical fashion.

 Like chess (check out these [mobile apps for chess players](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-for-chess-players/) ), you should be thinking several moves ahead, thinking about all four potential groupings rather than just the one you're about to submit. You may be confident in the four words you have selected, but be sure to look at the remaining words to make sure they can and will work together too.

## 5 Consider the Themes of Previous Puzzles

Close

 Every time you play (and beat) Connections, you should try and make a mental note of the types of connections that were involved. There are, after all, only so many themes the NYT can explore, albeit with numerous variations on those themes.

 The most common theme or genre is a simple description that applies to all four words in that grouping. Four different words for "backside," for example (as seen in the screenshot above). However, other common themes include things you'll need for a certain activity and four words that pair with another word to create common phrases.

 To help you find common themes the NYT uses regularly, revisit old puzzles at [the unofficial Connections archive](https://connections.swellgarfo.com/archive) .

## 6 Never Fall for the "One Away!" Tease

![The NYT Connections game with the "One away" message](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-game-one-away-guess.png)

 If you guess a group of four words and one is wrong, Connections will pop up with a cheery message telling you that you're "One away!" Most people's instinct will be to then swap one answer out for another one that could fit and try again. However, that's a huge mistake.

 Yes, you could guess correctly, swapping the one wrong answer out for the one right answer. But the odds are stacked against you, especially if you're only just starting. There's a 1-in-4 chance of picking the wrong answer you need to remove, and potentially a 1-in-12 chance of picking the correct word to replace it with. So instead, start again to avoid your mistakes dwindling.

## 7 Try Solving the Puzzle Offline First

![Solving the NYT Connections game offline on a pad](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/nyt-connections-puzzle-solving-offline.png)

 Dave Parrack/MakeUseOf

 The more serious Connections players should consider going offline for a while before even contemplating making a guess. Write the 16 words out on a sheet of paper, and try to figure out the most likely groupings of four before going back to [the Connections website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) .

 This may sound rather extreme, but working on Connections offline will give you a different perspective on the puzzle you're facing. Working on paper forces you to really think about the meaning of each word and the best way the 16 you have in front of you fit together.

## 8 Realize That Perfection Isn't Always Possible

![Making mistakes in the NYT Connections game](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nyt-connections-one-away-guess-1.png)

 Last but not least, you should remember that perfection isn't always possible. And it also doesn't matter. If you make three mistakes while solving Connections, that's fine. The key is solving it without making that fourth mistake and failing for the day.

 While it's extremely satisfying to play the perfect game of Connections, beyond bragging rights over friends you share your score with, it's no better than solving it with mistakes. So don't get caught up trying to play the perfect game. Just play the game, enjoy yourself, and aim to beat Connections every day.

 Connections can be a tough game. But by employing these tips and tricks, you'll make it easier to beat the game every time you play it. And even if you still fail, don't worry; just remember that another round will be available within 24 hours.
