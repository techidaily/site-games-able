 Before you attempt to book a service repair for your Xbox Series X|S through Xbox, you will need to register your device with Microsoft. This will enable you to access warranty information for your console, and ultimately book a repair for your console.

* You will then be faced with a terms and conditions pop-up. Select**Confirm** to register your Xbox.

 Alternatively, if your Xbox isn't listed under**Devices** , you can select**Register device** and input the serial number of your Xbox Series X|S to register your console manually. You can find the serial number of your Series X|S by examining the back label of your console, or by accessing the**Console info** tab under**System** settings.

 But with that, your Xbox Series X|S will be registered with Microsoft, and you should be well on your way to booking a repair with Xbox for your Series X|S.

## How to Check the Warranty Status of Your Xbox Series X|S

 Now your Xbox Series X|S is registered with Microsoft, you can move on to checking the warranty status of your console to see whether your repair will be free.

 To view the warranty information for your Xbox Series X|S, simply re-enter the**Devices** section of your Microsoft account via the official[Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/devices/?) page.

 All your registered devices should then show a brief message under**Warranty** telling you the status of your device's warranty. Find your Xbox Series X|S and check the associated**Warranty** message.

 However, if you feel the**Warranty** message is inaccurate or not displayed, you can select the**Info & support** tab for your Xbox Series X|S. From here, you can view your**Standard Limited Warranty** details or any other account warranty information.

This way, you may avoid ever needing to repair your Xbox.
