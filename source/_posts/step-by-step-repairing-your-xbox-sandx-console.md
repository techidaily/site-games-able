* You will then be faced with a terms and conditions pop-up. Select**Confirm** to register your Xbox.

 Alternatively, if your Xbox isn't listed under**Devices** , you can select**Register device** and input the serial number of your Xbox Series X|S to register your console manually.

## How to Check the Warranty Status of Your Xbox Series X|S

 Now your Xbox Series X|S is registered with Microsoft, you can move on to checking the warranty status of your console to see whether your repair will be free.

 To view the warranty information for your Xbox Series X|S, simply re-enter the**Devices** section of your Microsoft account via the official[Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/devices/?) page.

 All your registered devices should then show a brief message under**Warranty** telling you the status of your device's warranty. Find your Xbox Series X|S and check the associated**Warranty** message.
