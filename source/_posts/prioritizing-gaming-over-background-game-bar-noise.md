## Prioritizing Gaming Over Background Game Bar Noise

 The Xbox Game Bar makes capturing screenshots and recording gameplay clips super simple while gaming on a Windows PC. It also allows you to track system performance and chat with your friends. Being a feature-rich tool, it consumes extensive system resources that can negatively impact your system performance.

 If you want to save resources and improve game performance, you can turn off the feature in Windows 10 and restrict its background activity in Windows 11\. Below, we'll show you how to do just that.

## How to Disable the Xbox Game Bar in Windows 10
