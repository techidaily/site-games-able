## Explore EA Play’s PS5 Gaming Treasures

 EA Play is EA’s subscription service that lets you play some of EA’s best games for a monthly fee. You can get EA Play for Xbox, PC, or PlayStation, but paying for it on each of these won’t unlock it across all platforms. The games available in each store aren’t exactly the same.

 That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the best EA games on the PS5\. With $4.99 a month, EA Play will grant you access to all the games on this list and will give you a permanent 10% discount, among other perks. Whether or not you have EA Play, this is worth perusing to know the best EA offers on the PS5.

## 1\. It Takes Two

 It Takes Two is an award-winning thrilling local cooperative platformer game by Hazelight Studios. The story follows Cody and May, a husband and wife at the cusp of a divorce, who both get transformed into dolls by a sentient relationship book called Dr. Hakim.

 Two players must get the tiny characters from the garden shed to their house. They must avoid, maneuver, and overcome obstacles together as they journey to save their marriage. Many reviewers have described this game as genre-bending, and it’s one of the most refreshing games of its decade.

 You can get it with an EA Play membership on the PS5 or upgrade an existing copy to the PS5 version. Of course, It Takes Two also gets the 10% EA Play discount if you wish to buy the full game and own it forever.

## 2\. FIFA 23

 Save money by buying the last FIFA game released and get it on EA Play. If you love soccer games and you’re tired of buying the same game every year with a different number on it, then go get FIFA through EA Play.

[FIFA 23 is the last EA-FIFA game](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-ea-dropping-fifa-name/) because EA and FIFA’s 20-year partnership has come to an end. Therefore, FIFA 23 is a definitive game by virtue of it being the very last one in the series. Enjoy World Cups and FIFA-themed soccer in FIFA 23 because you might not get to feel it the same way in EA Sports FC (EA’s replacement for FIFA).

 One of FIFA’s greatest appeals is its easy couch co-op system. It’s one of those games you should just have on your PS5 so you and your pals can have fun together. We placed it on this list as a good solution for multiplayer action for all soccer lovers.

## 3\. The Sims 4

 Thanks to EA Play, you can[get the Sims 4 free of charge](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-and-play-the-sims-4-for-free/) . It’s a relatively old game, released in 2014, but it remains evergreen thanks to its timeless style and all the infinite possibilities and playstyles you can have in it. The Sims 4 is one of the best life simulation games, with options that let you create a Sims dynasty and family line that can go on for as long as you have time to play.

 Additionally, one of the most understated things about The Sims 4 is its architecture and interior decor possibilities. If you don’t mind fiddling about columns and carpets using a joystick instead of a mouse, then The Sims 4 on a PS5 might be a good treat for you. And if you really dislike joystick simulation games, you can also[connect a keyboard and mouse to your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-keyboard-mouse-ps5/) .

 Don’t forget that The Sims 4 has a lot of additional DLCs you can add to make the game a little more exciting. They do cost a bit of money, but it could be worth it if it drastically improves your game experience.

## 4\. Need for Speed Heat

 You’ll find almost all the contemporary Need for Speed games available on EA Play membership, but if we had to choose only one, we’d pick Need for Speed Heat. It combines the cars and racing system of Payback and the police chases of Most Wanted ‘05 to create a unique experience.

 In the day, you race on empty streets in legal, organized racing events, but at night, you rack up rep with illegal driving and exhilarating cop chases. As you gather rep at night, you unlock better car upgrades, parts, and vehicles to make your day racing easier.

 While it’s a PS4 game, playing it on the PS5’s SSD makes the game a lot smoother and load way faster. Need for Speed Unbound is the only native PS5 Need for Speed game on EA Play, but we still recommend Heat over it because it’s just more fun.

## 5\. Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2

 The last thing people expected PopCap to pull off was an FPS game derived from the award-winning strategy game Plants vs Zombies. The original Garden Warfare was an unexpected hit FPS game when it came out. But the sequel builds on the original and improves the game with more characters, more content, and even a single-player mode.

 While level progression in the game might be tedious, and you would need a[PlayStation Plus subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-playstation-plus/) to access multiplayer, Garden Warfare 2 is fun enough to rank on our list. An EA Play sub will give you full access to the game and a generous discount if you decide to buy it.

## 6\. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order

 Star Wars fans and non-Star Wars fans alike will enjoy playing as a displaced Jedi in Fallen Order. Its captivating story, challenging combat and level progression mechanic, rich music, and breathtaking platform-like world have earned this game many awards and nominations since its release in 2019.

 In this story, Cal Kestis, once a Jedi Padawan, is living in hiding before he is found by Imperial Inquisitors. Playing as Cal, you will attempt to outfox the Inquisitors, traveling across the galaxy and trying to rebuild the Jedi Order.

 This is definitely one of the more exciting adventure games on EA Play. In fact, we think this is the best single-player action-adventure game available on EA Play’s Play List for the PS5\. You should get it if you want an immersive single-player game with a challenging combat system, a well-written storyline, and a beautiful setting.

## 7\. UFC 3

 EA Sports UFC 3 is the prequel to EA Sports UFC 4, and it’s one of the most realistic combat games out there. If you don’t want the hack-and-slash hyper magic from games like Mortal Kombat but would like some challenging but realistic 1v1 combat, then this is what you should opt for.

 UFC 3 also takes the game out of the ring, and it’s the first UFC game to introduce G.O.A.T career mode, where you make decisions for your character outside of fighting. You can gain more fans, secure juicier contracts, and even antagonize rivals through the social media app in the game.

 As long as you stay away from the micro-transactions (AKA Ultimate Team) part of this game, you will enjoy it if you love combat sports. This version also gets commentary from Snoop Dogg in addition to the usual Joe Rogan.
