## Quietude: Steam Stays Off at Startup

 Steam automatically launches when you sign in to your computer. This is fine if you often immediately jump in to a game, or want to appear online so you can talk to friends on Steam Chat, but chances are it isn't necessary.

 We're going to show you how to disable Steam's automatic launch on startup.
