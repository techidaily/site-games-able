## 6 Things We Liked About Java Games

 Before mobile games evolved into what we know and love today, they were much, much different. The graphics were simple, as were the storylines. The stakes were lower because there wasn’t any competition. And you could play them without an internet connection.

 We’re talking about Java mobile games, which you probably played if you had access to a phone between the early 2000s and late 2010s.

 Sadly, Java games are no more, but we still remember what it was like to play them. Let’s look back on all the things we liked about Java games.

## 1\. Java Games Were Simple

 These days, mobile games are flashy, with impressive graphics, excellent dialogue, engaging storylines, and expensive budgets to make it happen. The difference between these flashy games and old Java games is stark.

 Java games were simple. You could finish certain games within a few hours, the storylines were fun but didn’t offer anything new, and the graphics were 2D with a pixel art style, static backgrounds, and basic animation.

 You didn’t have to worry about linking your social media account to your game, completing time-limited events, obtaining limited edition items, or competing against other players around the world. It was a much simpler time for mobile gaming.

## 2\. There Were a Wide Variety of Java Games

 There were many Java games to choose from, no matter what you wanted. Whether it was a racing game or action game to get your adrenaline going, a brain-teasing puzzle to test your cognitive thinking skills, an adventure game where you could explore fictional worlds, or something else, you could find and play it.

 And if you wanted a Java game to suit your needs, like something you could finish within hours or something more challenging that took longer, you could find it too.

 The wide variety of Java games made the mobile gaming experience fun and accessible for many of us.

## 3\. We Could Play Java Games Offline

 It’s practically impossible to play mobile games without connecting to the internet. It’s true there are some [mobile games that don’t require an internet connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fun-mobile-games-no-data-wi-fi/) , but there might be times when you need to sync your progress or watch ads to get coins or gems to help you along in the game.

 But Java games didn’t require an internet connection, so you could play them regardless of whether or not you had one.

## 4\. Java Games Were Affordable

 Many Java games were very affordable or even free. Many phones came with them pre-installed, and you could purchase more via an in-game portal. Sometimes phones came with demo versions of Java games, which you could play for free for a while before being asked to buy the full version.

 If you purchased Java games, you did so at a small cost. Many of us were able to play many Java mobile games on our phones this way.

## 5\. Java Games Were Lightweight

 Because Java games were so simple and didn’t require phones with powerful hardware, they were very small in size, ranging from a few kilobytes to a few megabytes. Because we didn’t need phones with lots of memory or storage space to play Java games, it was easy for us to have lots of them on our phones.

 Now that phones have become highly sophisticated with high processing power and storage capacity, it’s impossible to find mobile games of only a few kilobytes or megabytes.

## 6\. There Were No In-App Purchases in Java Games

[In-app purchases](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-does-in-app-purchases-mean/) are, unfortunately, a part of the modern mobile gaming experience, but Java games didn’t have this problem. They allowed you to experience the game fully without any restrictions.

 When you purchased a game, you knew you were making a one-time payment to access the full game with all its contents. There were no hidden costs or additional charges. Nor was there any pressure to cough up money like in [pay-to-win games](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-pay-to-win-in-video-games/) because games were easy to advance in, and you weren’t competing against real players.

 There are, of course, a few [completely free mobile games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-mobile-games-no-ads/) out there, but they don’t quite match the charm of Java games.

## Mobile Gaming Has Advanced Tremendously

 Mobile gaming has come a long way from simple graphics and basic gameplay. Today’s mobile games are sleek and, in some cases, even rival console games in quality. However, there’s no denying that there was something special about Java games.

 They may not have been impressive by today’s standards, but Java games were simple and fun, and they helped pave the way for games today. They’ll always have a place in our hearts.
