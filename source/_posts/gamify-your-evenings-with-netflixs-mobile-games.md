## What Are Netflix's Mobile Games?

 Netflix's mobile games are premium games you can play on your mobile as long as you're an active Netflix subscriber. They're completely free of ads and in-app purchases, meaning you can play them without interruptions, being nagged to upgrade, or putting up with limited functionality.

 For many years, Netflix exclusively offered movies and TV shows, leading it to become one of the biggest streaming services in the world. However, in 2021,[Netflix made its first foray into gaming](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile) , releasing a handful of mobile games for existing subscribers. Early on, we expressed the opinion that[Netflix's mobile games suck](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-netflix-mobile-games-suck/) , but times have changed.

 The games are available on both Android and iOS, and if you own a Chromebook or tablet, they are also available on those devices. Most can be played offline, ensuring you're not burning through data while playing mobile games while you're out and about.

## How to Access Netflix's Mobile Games

Close

 To access Netflix's mobile games, you need to find them on your phone's app store (the Google Play Store or Apple App Store). There are a couple of ways to do this:

1. Search the app store for games published by "Netflix, Inc." If you click the publisher's name, you should then see a full list of games.
2. Visit[this Netflix Help Center page](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/121442) and click**Available Games** . Browse the list for any titles you want to play, and follow the links through to the games.

 Unless you're already logged into Netflix on your phone, you'll need to sign in to your Netflix account the first time you download a game. However, as long as you stay logged in, any other games you download will automatically register your account and let you start playing.

## 5 Netflix Games I Personally Recommend

 I have been playing Netflix's mobile games since they first became available. Truth be told, there are too many to play each one, and some aren't to my personal taste. However, of the Netflix games I have played, I can personally recommend the following...

### 1\. Wonderputt Forever

![One of the holes in Wonderputt Forever](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/wonderputt-forever-netflix-game.png)

 Wonderputt Forever is, on the surface at least, a mini-golf game which sees you trying to complete a seemingly endless number of courses. However, it's really a game exploring the history of humankind through the physics of golf.

 This is one of the most addictive games you'll ever play. It's also one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play.

**Download:** Wonderputt Forever for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2031925/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.WonderputtForever) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wonderputt-forever/id1589157030)

### 2\. Pinball Masters

Close

 Pinball is perfectly suited to mobile gaming, as the on-screen controls are limited, and it can be quite a monotonous affair. However, with a number of different courses, many of which are licensed, you can spend hours playing Pinball Masters.

 In the same way that people play physical pinball machines, the lure here is the desire to beat your high score.

**Download:** Pinball Masters for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2031925/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.ZenPinball&hl=en&gl=US) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinball-masters-netflix/id6450060406)

### 3\. Laya's Horizon

![An early level on Laya's Horizon for mobile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/layas-horizon-netflix-game.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Laya's Horizon is another game that's perfectly suited to smartphones. You play the titular Laya, who is given a cloak enabling her to fly through the air. With some simple touchscreen controls, you can explore her world from above.

 The feeling of flying is sublime, and there's a simple structure to the game that will keep you coming back for more.

**Download:** Laya's Horizon for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2031925/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.SorasHorizon&hl=en&gl=US) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/layas-horizon/id1615116545)

### 4\. Before Your Eyes

Close

 The less said about Before Your Eyes the better, as it's a game you need to play in order to understand. However, the first indicator that this is something different is the control method, with you needing to blink into your phone's camera to move the story along.

 This is a game with a deeper meaning, like Flower, Firewatch, and other innovative titles that came before it.

**Download:** Before Your Eyes for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2031925/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.BeforeYourEyes&hl=en&gl=US) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/before-your-eyes/id1614500347)

### Football Manager 2024

![The starting screen for Football Manager 2024](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/football-manager-netflix-game.png)

 While this game is titled Football Manager, for the benefit of anyone in the US, it's actually a soccer management game. There are challenges to complete, and a career mode spanning 30 years. All on your mobile, and all available for free.

 If you're not careful, you will become addicted to this game. Especially if and when your team starts performing on the pitch.

**Download:** Football Manager 2024 for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2031925/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.FootballManagerMobile&hl=en&gl=US) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/football-manager-2024-mobile/id6446123740)

## Why I Love Netflix's Mobile Games

 I personally love Netflix's mobile games. For starters, there are dozens available, covering a range of genres, aesthetic styles, gameplay mechanics, and control methods. This means that there will be some suited to you.

 While they're not all to my taste, as they're free to Netflix subscribers, there's no risk in trying every single one.

 The benefit of these being a free perk for Netflix subscribers cannot be overstated. It takes all the risk out of mobile gaming, as you're not laying down any extra cash to purchase what could end up being a terrible game.

 The lack of ads and in-app purchases is refreshing. Sure, if you're used to[paying for mobile games](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-to-pay-for-mobile-games-rather-than-play-for-free/) , you'll be used to this. But for those of us who usually stick to free games, not having to contend with these annoyances is a bonus.

## Are Netflix's Games Worth the Subscription?

 On their own, Netflix games are probably not worth the subscription unless you're a massive mobile gamer. If you are, then it's worth looking through the list of Netflix games to see if there are enough there to justify signing up for Netflix. After all, with Netflix, you only commit to one month at a time.

 If you already subscribe to Netflix, you'd be foolish not to check out these mobile games. I guarantee that at least a handful will entertain you. And if they don't, you've simply wasted a little time (but no money).

 Not watching at least some of the many movies and TV shows available on Netflix while paying for the service is foolish, and so is not playing some of the streaming service's mobile game offerings.
