 In this case, it may be better for you to utilize your PC or laptop, and redeem your code through the Xbox app for Windows, available for free via[the official Xbox site](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc) . With the Xbox app installed on your laptop or PC, you can redeem your digital code by following these steps:

 As with redeeming a digital code from your Xbox Series X|S, if your code is valid you will then be able to confirm the associated digital content and unlock it for your Xbox account.

## 3\. How to Redeem Your Xbox Code From a PC or Mobile Browser

 A final way you can redeem your digital codes for your Xbox account is by accessing the Microsoft Store. This method is particularly useful if you don't have access to either your Xbox or the Xbox app for Windows. To redeem your digital code via the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

* Enter the**Redeem your code or gift card** page of the[Microsoft Store](https://account.microsoft.com/billing/redeem?refd=account.microsoft.com) .
* Sign into the Xbox account you want to redeem the code for.
* Enter the digital code's unique 25-character code.
