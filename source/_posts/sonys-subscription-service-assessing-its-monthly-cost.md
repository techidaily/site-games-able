## Sony's Subscription Service: Assessing Its Monthly Cost

 Sony's gaming subscription service, the PlayStation Plus, is a must-have for PlayStation users who are looking to get the most out of their consoles. The membership allows you to play online, and offers a large catalog of games that you can play free of charge.

 Sony has broken down this service into three tiers, where a more premium plan gets you more freebies and perks. Planning to get PlayStation Plus? Here is how much the subscription costs in popular regions.

## PlayStation Plus Pricing

The PlayStation Plus pricing plans are as follows:
