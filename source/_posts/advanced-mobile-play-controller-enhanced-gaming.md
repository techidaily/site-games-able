## Advanced Mobile Play: Controller-Enhanced Gaming

 Mobile gaming has come a long way since the days of Snake and Tetris on classic Nokia phones. Now, you can play full-featured games on your mobile device. Sometimes, with quality that's equal to consoles like the Nintendo Switch or PlayStation Vita.

 With so many options for mobile gaming, one might consider getting a Bluetooth controller. That way, you can play games like you would on a console but from your phone or tablet.

 If you’re looking to take your mobile gaming to the next step, check out the best mobile games that offer Bluetooth controller support.

## 1\. Call of Duty: Mobile

 Call of Duty has an exclusive mobile game which some claim is better than the COD games available on consoles.

 Call of Duty: Mobile features several modes. The most popular is the Battle Royale mode, which features a full-sized map. 100 players drop into the map and gather weapons and materials. The last person standing wins the match.

 There are also classic Deathmatch modes offered, and you can even play on your favorite legacy maps like Nuketown or Shipment. Call of Duty: Mobile is also a great first game to play if you’re looking to [use your iPhone as a game console](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-iphone-into-gaming-console/) .

**Download:** Call of Duty: Mobile for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/call-of-duty-mobile/id1287282214) |[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029511/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.callofduty.shooter) (Free, in-app purchases available).

## 2\. Minecraft

 One of the most popular games of all time, Minecraft, is available on mobile devices and offers controller support. Not only does this make gameplay more familiar for console players, but it’s actually much easier to use a controller and it improves the gameplay.

 Best of all, if you already play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you can log into the same maps and play with your friends, right from your mobile device. And, if you already have a Nintendo Switch, you can also [use Nintendo Switch Joy-Con as a controller for your iPhone](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-connect-joy-cons-to-iphone/) .

## 3\. Fortnite

 Another classic game loved by most, you can play Fortnite on mobile phones as well. It’s also cross-platform, so you can play with your friends just like you would on the console. After all, games like Fortnite are more fun when playing with others.

 Many might think that Fortnite for mobile devices is different from the console or PC versions. However, it has the same maps, the same updates, and the same weapons. The only difference is the 30FPS graphics on mobile devices, just like it is on the Nintendo Switch.

 However, it is important to know that some advanced players actually play in 30FPS anyway, as they claim it makes it easier to find other players. So who knows, maybe playing on your phone will make you a better player.

 Playing Fortnite on iPhone requires cloud gaming, and while you can download it to Android devices, cloud gaming is recommended.

**Download:** Fortnite for mobile devices via the official site for [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/mobile) (Free, in-app purchases available).

## 4\. Rocket League Sideswipe

## Improve Your Mobile Games With Controller Support

 If you enjoy gaming on your iPhone or Android device, then you might want to consider taking your gaming to the next level and getting a controller. Not only does it improve gameplay, but in some cases it can actually make you better at the game.
