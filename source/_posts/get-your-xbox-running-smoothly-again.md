## Get Your Xbox Running Smoothly Again

 Being faced with a hardware fault with one of your consoles can be quite a headache and even more troublesome if you have to send your console off for repair. However, if your Xbox Series X|S develops a fault and needs to be sent for an official repair, the process can be eased if you know the right details.

 So, if you're looking to book a repair for your Xbox Series X|S with Xbox, we can help guide you through the necessary details, like warranty information and serial numbers, and help with the repair process. Let's take a look.

## How to Register Your Xbox Series X|S With Microsoft

 Before you attempt to book a service repair for your Xbox Series X|S through Xbox, you will need to register your device with Microsoft. This will enable you to access warranty information for your console, and ultimately book a repair for your console.

 If you register your console and find it to be under warranty, you could even save money on the repair. This makes registering your console an essential and potentially beneficial process. To register your Xbox Series X|S with Microsoft, follow these steps:

* Enter the Microsoft devices tab by signing into your Microsoft account on any web browser via[the official Microsoft webpage](https://account.microsoft.com/devices/?) .
* Under**Devices** , find your Xbox Series X|S console, and select**Register** .

![A screenshot of the Devices page for a Microsoft account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3091.jpg)

* You will then be faced with a terms and conditions pop-up. Select**Confirm** to register your Xbox.

 Alternatively, if your Xbox isn't listed under**Devices** , you can select**Register device** and input the serial number of your Xbox Series X|S to register your console manually. You can find the serial number of your Series X|S by examining the back label of your console, or by accessing the**Console info** tab under**System** settings.

 But with that, your Xbox Series X|S will be registered with Microsoft, and you should be well on your way to booking a repair with Xbox for your Series X|S.

## How to Check the Warranty Status of Your Xbox Series X|S

 Now your Xbox Series X|S is registered with Microsoft, you can move on to checking the warranty status of your console to see whether your repair will be free.

 To view the warranty information for your Xbox Series X|S, simply re-enter the**Devices** section of your Microsoft account via the official[Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/devices/?) page.

 All your registered devices should then show a brief message under**Warranty** telling you the status of your device's warranty. Find your Xbox Series X|S and check the associated**Warranty** message.

![A screenshot of a registered device in the Devices section of a Microsoft account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3097.jpg)

 However, if you feel the**Warranty** message is inaccurate or not displayed, you can select the**Info & support** tab for your Xbox Series X|S. From here, you can view your**Standard Limited Warranty** details or any other account warranty information.

![A screenshot of the Device Coverage Information for an Xbox Series X registered under a Microsoft account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3100.jpg)

 Bear in mind, that standard Xbox Series X|S warranties for consoles last for 12 months, so if you purchase your Xbox upon release, its warranty will have unfortunately expired. Because of this, you should[maintain consoles like the Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-maintain-xbox-series-x-hardware/) throughout its generation. This way, you may avoid ever needing to repair your Xbox.

 From here, you need to**Select a shipping method** and agree to Microsoft's terms and conditions. You will then be expected to pay for the repair and any delivery fees. If your console is under warranty, the repair fees should be waived depending on the exact issue with your Xbox.

 But with your repair paid for and the delivery method selected, you can expect your Xbox to be fixed and returned to you very soon, or at least depending upon your chosen delivery method.

 However, if you find the price tag for a repair to be too expensive, there are plenty of Xbox issues that are fixable at home. For instance,[fixing Xbox Wireless Controller stick drift](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-xbox-one-controller-drift/) can be easy and doesn't necessarily require replacements or an official repair.
