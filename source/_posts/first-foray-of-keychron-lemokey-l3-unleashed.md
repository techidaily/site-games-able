 The Keychron Lemokey L3 is a premium gaming mechanical keyboard with hot-swappable switches, a 1,000Hz polling rate, and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity.
* It offers impressive battery life of up to 300 hours on Bluetooth and features a robust CNC machined aluminum build for durability.
* The Lemokey L3 is highly customizable using VIA software and has a tenkeyless design with extra macro keys and a media knob for added functionality.

 Up until now, Keychron focused on delivering exceptional mechanical keyboards for the generalist: excellent for typing, great for gaming. Its new Lemokey L3 gaming keyboard changes that, becoming Keychron's first official gaming keyboard with all the Keychron customization we're accustomed to.

 The Lemokey L3 features smooth, fast, hot-swappable switches, a fast 1,000Hz polling rate, 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and extensive keyboard customization options using VIA.

 It's a fantastic keyboard; there is little doubt about that. But is the Lemokey L3 a "gaming keyboard," or just a brilliant mechanical keyboard with some extra gaming features?

## Configuration

 Like all Keychron keyboards, the Lemokey L3 is available in several configurations. The Fully Assembled Knob version, which features in this review, will set you back $214, while the barebones version is $194.

 As I've said with other Keychron mechanical keyboard reviews, the extra 20 bucks is well worth it if you don't have a vast array of switches and keycaps you want to use. There's a choice of three Gateron Jupiter switches: Red (linear), Brown (tactile), and Banana (also tactile, but with more operating force and shorter travel).

 It's a good range of options, not forgetting that the Lemokey L3 is a hot-swappable keyboard. Hot-swappable means you can replace the keyboard's switches without soldering; they're plug-and-play.

## Style and Construction

 The Lemokey L3 feels sublime. It's a premium gaming mechanical keyboard that weighs an excellent 1.97kg (4.3lbs). You're basically buying a block of high-quality CNC machined aluminum that also happens to be a mechanical keyboard; you won't be shoving the Lemokey L3 in your rucksack for the local LAN session, that's for sure. The weight has another important use, though—stopping your keyboard from moving around as you game or type.

![person-using-the-keychron-lemokey-l3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/person-using-the-keychron-lemokey-l3.jpg)

 Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf

 With dimensions of 15.8 x 5.4 x 1.7 inches, the Lemokey L3 is a 91-key, tenkeyless design. However, the larger-than-usual footprint for a tenkeyless keyboard comes by way of the four additional customizable macro keys, above which sits the customizable media control knob. A full-size keyboard is usually around 17 inches wide, while most TKLs are around 14 inches.

 The case is relatively uniform. Around each of the main areas is a slightly raised lip for decoration, while there is a small vent at the front of the case for airflow (and style). The USB-C input is on the rear, along with a switch for moving between wired, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz wireless (using the supplied USB dongle).

![plug-and-switch-on-the-back-of-the-keychron-lemokey-l3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/plug-and-switch-on-the-back-of-the-keychron-lemokey-l3.jpg)

 Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf

 One nice touch is the three lights above the direction keys, each pertaining to a different feature. The left light is the one you'll see most, as it shows the relative charge level of the keyboard. The middle light details your wireless connection status, and the third light shows whether Caps Lock is switched on.

 The Lemokey L3 is available in three color schemes: Carbon Black, Navy Blue, and Space Silver. I've been sent the Space Silver design, which looks mechanical and futuristic, but the Navy Blue and Carbon Black designs both look tidy, and the double-shot PBT keycaps are sculpted to maximize efficiency. Each color scheme comes with a unique set of additional keys; in a nod to the keyboard's gaming credentials, some of the additional keys bear the iconic PlayStation symbols.

![customizable-buttons-on-the-keychron-lemokey-l3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/customizable-buttons-on-the-keychron-lemokey-l3.jpg)

 Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf

 Inside the Lemokey L3 are multiple layers of sound-absorbing foam, which, along with the double-gasket mounted design, contribute to the smooth typing experience and warming typing sound.

## Battery Life and Connectivity

 Battery life is another plus point for the Lemokey L3—though, given its weight, I strongly doubt you'll ever roam too far from a USB-C port or an outlet. The Lemokey L3 is rated for up to 200 hours while using 2.4GHz wireless, rising to a whopping 300 hours while using Bluetooth. I didn't track this precisely, but I never ran out of battery using either wireless mode.

## Lemokey L3 Typing Experience

 The Lemokey L3 is a dream to type on. I've been sent the Gateron Jupiter Brown switches, which require 55g actuation force, have 2mm pre-travel, and 4mm total travel. You'll bottom out on keypresses, but the overall movement and response of the Jupiter Brown switches are mostly smooth.

 I haven't used the Jupiter Red switches, but I suspect the lightweight 45g actuation force might lead to typing errors (as often happens with lightweight switches). Similarly, the short 3.4mm total travel of the Jupiter Banana may become frustrating as you constantly bottom out the keys, so the Jupiter Brown is a happy middle-ground.

 Gateron's Jupiter Brown switches sound good, too, as you can hear in the Lemokey L3 typing sample below.

 If you're going to use the Lemokey L3 for gaming (it's a gaming mechanical keyboard, after all), I suggest using wired or 2.4GHz wireless mode. This way, you can put the Lemokey's 1,000Hz polling rate to good use, ensuring that your inputs are registered as quickly as possible in-game.

![back-of-the-keychron-lemokey-l3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/back-of-the-keychron-lemokey-l3.jpg)

 Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf

 Even for someone who doesn't game competitively online, the L3's inputs are noticeably fast and accurate, and if you do frequent games like CS2 (formerly CS:GO), CoD Warzone or Modern Warfare, Overwatch, or any of the myriad first-person shooters, having your inputs registered rapidly is vital.

 The Lemokey L3 has a five-degree typing angle, which is comfortable for me but might not suit everyone. However, as the L3 doesn't have any integrated adjustment feet, you're stuck with it. You could grab the Lemokey L3 wrist rest from the Keychron site, but it was out of stock at the time of writing.

## Customization With VIA

 Keychron has long used VIA for its desktop customization software. It's free, well-supported by the mechanical keyboard community, and has extensive customization options. However, most folks who use a gaming keyboard will be more familiar with the custom, proprietary software created by the big gaming companies. In comparison, VIA is a little different, lacking the straightforward options and menus found in those other desktop software options.

 It's not that VIA is difficult to use; it just takes some time to get up to speed with. Small frustrations, such as VIA not recognizing the Lemokey L3 and having to download and import the keyboard's JSON file, will be more apparent for those new to Keychron and VIA. It's just not as polished.

 At other times, you might make changes without realizing it and then struggle to revert them. I swapped out the top row of numbers with Macro 0 keys accidentally, but there is no CTRL + Z option to undo your changes. VIA is a great tool, but if Keychron wants to attract a large slice of the gaming keyboard market, it might be time to create an in-house tool.

![person-removing-a-keycap-from-the-keychron-lemokey-l3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/person-removing-a-keycap-from-the-keychron-lemokey-l3.jpg)

 Hannah Stryker / MakeUseOf

 Still, the range of customization is always impressive. You can remap any key, including the media control knob, and VIA also gives you control of the Lemokey's south-facing RGB lighting.

## Is the Lemokey L3 a Good Gaming Keyboard?

 The fully assembled knob version of the Lemokey L3 retails for $214\. It's a great price for a truly top-notch keyboard and one that will last you a literal lifetime.

 I'm not completely convinced of the Lemokey's gaming credentials, though, and the lack of an in-house desktop tool might put some potential buyers off. But anyone who knows mechanical keyboards will know the quality that Keychron delivers in any of its hardware, and the Lemokey L3 is no different.

 I'm also interested to see what other gaming keyboards are launched under the Lemokey brand. Currently, the Lemokey L3 is the only keyboard using this branding, and if Keychron really wants to push into the gaming keyboard market, it needs to expand its product line.

 Overall, the Lemokey L3 might not be an outright gaming keyboard, but it's a brilliant keyboard in all other areas.
