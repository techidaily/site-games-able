## Directing the Flow of Gaming Power: Epic + Steam Integration

 Steam and Epic Games are two of the most popular gaming launchers for Windows PC. While these platforms are separate, you can link your Epic Games and Steam accounts to enjoy features like friends sync, cross-play, and achievement sync.

 Here's how to link your Epic Games and Steam accounts and why you should do it.

## Why You Should Connect Your Epic Games and Steam Accounts

 While there are several benefits of linking your Epic Games and Steam accounts, the most important ones are listed below:

* You can link Epic Games and Steam accounts to invite someone from your Steam friend list to play games on Epic Games. This way, you can even play with a friend who doesn't have an Epic Games account (check out how to [set up your Epics Games account](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-epic-games-account-cross-platform/) ).
* If a game is available on both Epics Games and Steam and supports cross-progression, you can link both platform accounts to carry your progress from one platform to another. This is especially useful when you're having [trouble playing games on Steam](https://www.makeuseof.com/troubleshoot-windows-steam-games-not-playing/) or Epic Games.
* After linking both accounts, you can purchase games from Epic Games Store using your Steam Wallet's balance.

 Having known the reasons, now let's check out how to quickly link your Epic Games and Steam account.

## How to Link Your Epic Games and Steam Accounts

To connect your Epic Games and Steam accounts, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Epic Games website](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/) on your browser.
