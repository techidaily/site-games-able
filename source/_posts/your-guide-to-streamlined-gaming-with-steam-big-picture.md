## Your Guide to Streamlined Gaming with Steam Big Picture

 Steam's Big Picture mode lets you navigate Steam with only a controller, no mouse or keyboard required. If you play a lot of games with a controller or use Steam in a living room gaming setup, Big Picture mode could be just what you're looking for to take your gaming rig to the next level.

 If that sounds like something you would be interested in, this article will explain exactly what Steam's Big Picture mode is and how to use it.

## What Is Steam's Big Picture Mode?

 Big Picture mode is a Steam feature that gives the platform an all-new user interface. This UI is easy to navigate with a controller and features larger font to make it easier to read when you're gaming on television screens. This allows you to enjoy your Steam games from the comfort of your sofa rather than perched at your desk, hunched over your computer.

 Big Picture mode looks similar to the home screen interfaces of many of your favorite video game consoles. It provides you with all the functionality of the desktop app but in a new easy-to-read format.

## Why Should I Use Steam's Big Picture Mode?

 Big Picture mode is designed specifically to help gamers [set up and use console controllers to play games on Steam](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-use-console-controllers-steam/) .

 But although it's designed to help gamers use Steam with a controller instead of a mouse and keyboard, you don't have to be gaming in your living room to use Big Picture mode. Steam's Big Picture mode works well in any setting, and it isn't just for TV use.
