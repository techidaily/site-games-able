 Bear in mind, that standard Xbox Series X|S warranties for consoles last for 12 months, so if you purchase your Xbox upon release, its warranty will have unfortunately expired. Because of this, you should[maintain consoles like the Xbox Series X](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-maintain-xbox-series-x-hardware/) throughout its generation. This way, you may avoid ever needing to repair your Xbox.

## How to Book a Repair for Your Broken Xbox Series X|S

 At this point, you should have all the information you need to fix your Xbox Series X|S and send it off for an official repair. So, to book a repair for your Series X|S, return to the**Devices** section of your Microsoft account via[Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/devices/?) and follow these steps:

* Under**Devices** , find your Xbox Series X|S and select**Info & support** .
* To start the repair process, select**Start order** .
* Select a**Category** for your repair. For an Xbox Series X|S, select**Device** .
* Choose an**Issue type** matching the issue your console is experiencing.

 From here, you need to**Select a shipping method** and agree to Microsoft's terms and conditions. You will then be expected to pay for the repair and any delivery fees. If your console is under warranty, the repair fees should be waived depending on the exact issue with your Xbox.

 But with your repair paid for and the delivery method selected, you can expect your Xbox to be fixed and returned to you very soon, or at least depending upon your chosen delivery method.

 However, if you find the price tag for a repair to be too expensive, there are plenty of Xbox issues that are fixable at home. For instance,[fixing Xbox Wireless Controller stick drift](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-xbox-one-controller-drift/) can be easy and doesn't necessarily require replacements or an official repair.
