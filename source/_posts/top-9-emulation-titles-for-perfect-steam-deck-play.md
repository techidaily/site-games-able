## Top 9 Emulation Titles for Perfect Steam Deck Play

 Emulation might be one of the first places your mind goes when you think of the Steam Deck. With reasonable specs and a portable form factor, emulation on the Steam Deck is in a great place, but which emulators are the best?

Let's have a look at the nine best emulators for the Steam Deck.

## 1. Dolphin

![screenshot of the dolphin emulator in the steam deck ui](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_dolphin_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg)

 Emulation of the sixth and seventh console generations is a treat on the Steam Deck, with its power easily being able to comfortably run any game you can think of from this time. So, Dolphin, the Wii and GameCube emulator, is a must-have.

 With minimal setup, GameCube games can be run at higher resolutions and higher frame rates. With a little elbow grease, the motion-dependent library of the Wii can be accessed with a combination of trackpad controls and gyro use. Dolphin should be one of the first stops you make with a new Steam Deck.

## 2. Cemu

 The next stop is another Nintendo console. Cemu is your answer to running Wii U games on your Steam Deck. This is also the best emulator solution to run Breath of the Wild, a popular emulation choice for the Steam Deck.

 Rather than trying to emulate the much more challenging Switch, consider that some of the Switch's biggest titles were originally on the Wii U, which makes Cemu an extremely attractive offering for performance-mindful players.

## 3. PCSX2

![screenshot of pcsx2 emulator running on steam deck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_pcsx2_emulator_steamdeck.jpg)

 Breaking away from the Nintendo consoles, PCSX2 is a tried and true PlayStation 2 emulator. In terms of performance, the Steam Deck has no problem meeting the demands of PS2-era games.

[With the PS2 considered by some to be the best console of all time](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-the-ps2-is-the-best-console-of-all-time/) , PCSX2 will add an immense amount of value to your emulation library.

 This is helped by the program generally performing better on Linux-based systems than it does on Windows, meaning that even emulation veterans will be surprised with the results here.

## 4. PPSSPP

![screenshot of the ppsspp emulator runnung on steam deck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_ppsspp_emulator_steamdeck.jpg)

 The PSP was one of the first handhelds that really focused on performance and visuals. While the results might seem quaint today, the PSP has a full library of games geared towards portability. It's a perfect match for the Steam Deck.

 PPSSPP will bring this library to your Steam Deck. Just don't be too surprised when the crunchy visuals are a bit more apparent on the Deck's large screen.

## 5. melonDS

![screenshot of melonds steam deck ui](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_melonds_emulator_steamdeck.jpg)

 Why not add in another classic handheld while we're at it? MelonDS aims to bring fast and accurate emulation for the original DS.

 Most DS emulators struggle to comfortably present the two screens of the DS, and emulating the DS on most portable hardware provides lackluster results.

 Thankfully, with the large screen of the Steam Deck, and the customizability of melonDS, you shouldn't run into any problems laying out the screens exactly how you'd like.

## 6. Citra

![screenshot of the citra emulator in the steam deck ui](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_citra_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg)

 Citra's performance is stable on most hardware, and the Steam Deck isn't an exception.

 Citra is a 3DS emulator, which means all the benefits and drawbacks of melonDS can be found here. You'll have to manage where each screen is displayed, though it isn't a problem on the Deck's capable resolution.

 This is another console with a broad library, so picking it up is a must.

## 7. mGBA

![screenshot of the mgba emulator in the steam deck ui](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_mgba_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg)

 mGBA will be your answer to emulating anything from the Game Boy library. Not just the original Game Boy, but every Game Boy game up to the Game Boy Advance.

 These games will look a little chunky being blown up on the Steam Deck screen, but you'll have access to customization options to tweak to your liking. mGBA is a great addition to any growing emulation library, and feels right at home on the Steam Deck.

## 8. Ryujinx

 Switch emulation is tempting when it comes to the Steam Deck. The Switch is a very similar concept to the Steam Deck, so the chance to emulate Switch games should be a no-brainer.

 Unfortunately, Switch emulation isn't to the state where you can expect effortless high performance on the Deck. You can expect to play a great many games, but with differing results.

 That's why you'll want both Ryujinx and Yuzu. Ryujinx focuses on accurate emulation, while Yuzu focuses on performance.

 Between the two of these emulators, you'll likely be able to run a huge chunk of the Switch library. Just adjust your expectations, and get acquainted with[common Steam Deck optimization methods](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-optimize-steam-deck/) that will improve performance.

## 9. MAME

 MAME is an all-purpose solution for arcade hardware emulation. It runs great and is intuitively designed, but is naturally a lot more complicated than the previous emulators discussed.

 You'll be looking at a much longer setup time with MAME on the Steam Deck, but you'll be gaining access to one of the largest game libraries yet.

 Control configuration is going to be one of the biggest issues with MAME on the Deck. Thankfully, the Deck boasts an impressive amount of configurable buttons and touchpads. If there's a will, there will be a way.

## Get EmuDeck

![screenshot of emulators listed in steam deck ui](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_emulators_listed_in_steamdeck_ui.jpg)

 With all of the above emulators in mind, we have access to a decent chunk of gaming history. Keep in mind that you'll want to get the Linux versions of these emulators, unless you've installed Windows onto your Steam Deck.

 You'll also need to navigate Steam Deck's Desktop Mode to configure a lot of these emulators to your preference. While this is a valid method and a chance to try some[tips to use the Steam Deck's Desktop Mode without a dock](https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-use-steam-deck-desktop-mode-without-dock/) , EmuDeck makes the process a lot easier.

 EmuDeck turns the process of setting up dozens of emulators into an almost-one-click process. Every emulator mentioned in this list is available on EmuDeck.

 It's highly recommended you consider EmuDeck if you're looking to easily set these emulators up. For users who aren't very familiar with Desktop Mode, it's almost a must.

 Another reason EmuDeck is important is its ability to convert ROMs directly into gaming mode-compatible shortcuts. You'll want to do this to avoid switching into Desktop Mode whenever you'd like to play.

## The Steam Deck Is for More Than Just PC Games

 While the Steam Deck carries unbeatable value in terms of access to your PC library, it's easy to forget just how capable this little device is. Being a computer on the go means that your options for play are just about endless.

 With this list of emulators, you'll be able to play games stretching all the way back through gaming history, as well as some new releases.
