## Avoid Gaming Grief: Resolving Epic Launcher Fails on Windows

 The Epic Games Launcher serves as the central hub for launching and managing all your games bought or downloaded from the Epic Store. However, you can’t do any of that if the Epic Games Launcher keeps freezing or crashing on your Windows computer.

 If you are facing a similar issue, this guide contains some troubleshooting tips that will help.

## 1\. Close the Epic Games Launcher Completely and Reopen It

 The Epic Games Launcher may freeze on your Windows PC due to malfunctioning or unresponsive app processes. In most cases, you can resolve the issue by closing the Epic Games Launcher completely and then reopening it. Hence, it's the first thing you should try.

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to [open the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) .
2. Locate and select**EpicGamesLauncher** on the list.
3. Click the**End task** option at the top.  
![Close Epic Games Launcher](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/close-epic-games-launcher.jpg)

Reopen the Epic Games Launcher and try using it.

## 2\. Run Epic Games Launcher as an Administrator

 Running the Epic Games Launcher with admin rights can help you avoid any issues caused by a lack of relevant permissions to access system files and settings. Right-click on the**Epic Games Launcher** shortcut and select**Run as administrator** . Select**Yes** when the UAC (User Account Control) prompt appears.

![Run Epic Games Launcher as Admin](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/run-epic-games-launcher-as-admin.jpg)

 If this method gets Epic Games Launcher to operate smoothly, you can configure it to [always run as an administrator on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ways-to-run-a-program-as-administrator-in-windows/) .

## 3\. Check the Epic Games Server Status

 Issues with Epic Games servers can also cause its launcher to misbehave on your Windows PC. You should [check Epic Games server status](https://status.epicgames.com/) to ensure they are operating smoothly.

 If there’s an issue with the servers, you have no option but to wait for the company to resolve the problem on its end. Following that, you should be able to use Epic Games Launcher as before.

## 4\. Check for App Updates

 Using an outdated version of Epic Games Launcher can also cause it to crash or freeze on Windows. Hence, it’s a good idea to update the Epic Games Launcher if you haven’t already. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Launch Epic Games Launcher on your computer.
2. Click your**profile icon** in the top right corner and choose**Settings** from the list.
3. If a newer version is available, click the**Restart and Update** button that appears.

## 5\. Disable Fullscreen Optimizations

 Enabling full-screen optimizations for an app on Windows can boost its performance in full-screen mode. However, this feature can sometimes cause compatibility issues, leading to abrupt app crashes. You can try disabling full-screen optimizations for the Epic Games Launcher to see if that restores normalcy.

1. Close the Epic Games Launcher using Task Manager.
2. Right-click on the**Epic Games Launcher** shortcut and select**Properties** .

## 6\. Clear the Epic Games Launcher’s Webcache Folder

 Epic Games Launcher, like any other program, creates cache files on your PC to load content faster and improve its performance. However, once this data becomes old or corrupted, it hurts more than it helps. When this happens, Epic Games Launcher may become unresponsive or crash on your Windows PC.

 You can try clearing the existing cache data associated with Epic Games Launcher to fix the problem. To do so, use these steps:

1. Right-click the**Start** icon on the taskbar to open the Power User menu.

3. Type**%localappdata%** in the Open field and click**OK** .
4. Navigate to**EpicGamesLauncher > Saved** folder.
5. Locate and select**webcache** folders.
6. Click the**trash icon** at the top to delete them.

## 7\. Fix the D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll File

 Do you see the D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll error when Epic Games Launcher crashes on Windows? If so, the D3DCOMPILER\_43.dll file on your PC may be corrupt or missing. Here's what you can do to fix it.

1. Press**Win + E** to open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to**C: > Windows > SysWOW64** .
3. Locate the**D3DCOMPILER\_43** file and delete it.

![Delete the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll File](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/delete-the-d3dcompiler_43-dll-file.jpg)

 Run the installer file and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process. After that, try using Epic Games Launcher again.

## 8\. Repair the Epic Games Launcher
