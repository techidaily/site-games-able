[Sony's PS2 is arguably the best gaming console of all time](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-the-ps2-is-the-best-console-of-all-time/) , and If you yearn to revisit the golden era of the sixth-generation consoles, the AetherSX2 emulator offers a compelling option. It comes with native Apple silicon support, ensuring outstanding performance and stability.

 On my M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of unified memory (RAM), I've managed to play games like Burnout Revenge and Resident Evil 4 via AetherSX2, running flawlessly at a steady 60FPS with full resolution.

 Although it's currently not in active development, AetherSX2 remains recognized as one of the top PS2 emulators for macOS, making it an ideal choice for those seeking to rekindle the magic of timeless classics.

AetherSX2 is not available for Intel-based Macs.
