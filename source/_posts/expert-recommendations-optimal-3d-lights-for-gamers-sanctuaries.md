This nine-piece triangular light panel kit works with Alexa and delivers mesmeric lighting effects that synchronize perfectly with your music. Up to 30 light panels can be connected to one single controller and can be arranged in any configuration. The mounting tape makes these an absolute breeze to install as well.

 Using the Nanoleaf desktop app, you can use the immersive Screen Mirror feature and set your on-screen activity to reflect onto your light panels, providing you with a multisensory experience. Use the app to create scenes and playlists, set schedules, and fully customize your settings. You can even share your customized scenes or download other people's scenes.

 These Nanoleaf light panels sense audio and transform that audio into color in real time. And with 16 million colors to play with, the color animations will give any gaming setup a real bang. Although this kit does come with a pretty hefty price tag, the possibilities for customization are almost endless.
