## How to Efficiently Process Game Console Returns

 Not every game will meet your expectations or even work as you may expect upon launch, and with physical copies of games becoming less common, refunding an unwanted game may not be as simple as returning the disc.

 For digital Xbox purchases, however, you can utilize refund policies and systems to help make returning your digital game as simple as possible. But how can you take advantage of Xbox's digital refund policies, and what constitutes an eligible digital refund for your Xbox games? Let's find out.

## Refund Requirements for Xbox Digital Purchases

 Before attempting to refund a digital Xbox purchase you made via your Xbox account or Xbox Series X|S, there are a few requirements you'll have to meet to guarantee that you can successfully refund a purchase. Xbox defines the requirements for a successful digital refund by the following:

* Refund requests for digital games have to be made within 14 days of the purchase date.
* Refund requests will only be successful if they are made for games in which you haven't accumulated a significant amount of playtime.
* Purchases made for single-use content, like microtransactions and in-game currency, can only be refunded if you haven't redeemed or used the content.

 These three key points represent the most significant requirements for refunding a digital Xbox purchase, but a full list of requirements and clauses can be found via [Xbox](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) .

 And with digital-only consoles now available, digital refund requirements become an essential element of [things you should consider when buying a digital-only console](https://www.makeuseof.com/buying-tips-digital-only-console/) . After all, if you purchase an Xbox Series S, Xbox's refund process for digital purchases is your primary way of returning games.

## How to Check Whether You Can Refund an Xbox Purchase

 Now you know the general requirements a purchase needs to meet to be refunded, you can start to check your recent digital Xbox purchases to see whether they are available for refund.

 Luckily, Xbox has streamlined this process to ensure that no unnecessary refund requests can be made. To check your Xbox account for refund-eligible digital purchases follow these steps:

* View your**Subscription & billing** options via [the official Xbox website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) .
* Select**Sign In** to load your account details.

![A screenshot of the Subscriptions and Billing page of the official Xbox site with Sign In highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3133.jpg)

* The**Subscription & billing** page will then be catered to your Xbox account, and any purchases eligible for a refund will be displayed on-screen under**Request availability** .

 It's important to note that**Request availability** will remain blank if none of your recent digital purchases are eligible for a refund. And, even if some purchases appear, they still need to meet the aforementioned requirements outlined by Xbox to go through as a successful refund.

## How to Refund Digital Xbox Purchases

 With the requirements of a refund for a digital Xbox purchase defined, and with access to the**Request availability** section of**Subscription & billing** , you're ready to submit your refund request.

 To do so, ensure you have signed into the**Subscription & billing** page via [the official Xbox website](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders) and follow these steps:

* From the available purchases listed under**Request availability** , highlight the purchase you want to refund.
* Select**Request a refund** .

![A screenshot of the Refund Request Availability option available through the official Xbox website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3138-1.jpg)

* From here, you will need to define your reasons for requesting a refund via the**Reason for request** and**What happened?** boxes displayed on-screen.
* With your reasoning defined, check that the displayed**Email address** matches that of your account and select**Next** .
* Confirm the on-screen details and finalize the refund request by selecting**Submit** .

 Your refund request will then be reviewed within 72 hours. In the meantime, you can check the status of your refund by using the**Refund status** tab of the**Subscriptions & billing** page.

 But with that, you have successfully requested a refund for a digital Xbox purchase. And, as we enter a primarily digital era of console gaming, when it comes to [saving money on your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-ways-to-save-money/) , managing your digital purchases is something everyone should get used to.

## Avoid Unwanted Purchases and Games With Digital Refunds for Xbox

 Even if you are faced with an unwanted or bitterly disappointing online gaming purchase, if you made the purchase via your Xbox account, you can help to ensure you get your money back. And as long as you meet the requirements defined by Xbox, the process is simple and can see your money returned within 72 hours or less.

 Within an industry that seems to be releasing more and more unfinished games, or titles reliant on other purchases, having an easy way to return a digital game is essential to any gaming platform, especially those with all-digital consoles.
