## Expanding Your Fortnite Investment with Sony PS5

 Fortnite’s in-game currency, V-Bucks, is the key to getting cool skins and paying for a Battle Pass. While you can earn V-Bucks by grinding those free Battle Pass levels, buying some is much easier.

 If you’ve never bought it on a PS5 before, getting V-Bucks is similar to buying other game add-ons. You must first add a payment method or fund your wallet, then purchase V-Bucks from an in-game menu. We’ve detailed the steps below.

## Add a Payment Method or Preload Your Wallet

 The first thing you must do to get V-Bucks is ready a payment method. There are generally two options: fund your PSN wallet with a gift card (or credit/debit card or PayPal account) or add a functioning payment method to your PS5.

 The methods are a bit long, so we’ve detailed it in our dedicated guide on [how to add funds to your PSN wallet on a PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/add-psn-wallet-funds-and-buy-games-on-ps5/) . You’ll find where to add payment methods in **Settings > Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Payment Methods** . You could also redeem a gift card in the**Redeem Codes** section of the Payment and Subscriptions panel.

 Fortnite won’t charge you tax for buying V-Bucks, so you don’t have to worry about unexpected inflated prices.

* **$7.99** will get you 1,000 V-Bucks.
* **$19.99** will get you 2,800 V-Bucks.
* **$31.99** will get you 5,000 V-Bucks.
* **$79.99** will get you 13,500 V-Bucks.

 Once you have your money ready, you have to boot Fortnite and buy V-Bucks in-game.

## How to Buy Fortnite V-Bucks In-Game

 After you open Fortnite and log in, you’ll find yourself in the lobby. Follow the steps below to buy V-Bucks:

1. Continuously tap**R1** on your controller till you reach the**V-Bucks** tab in Fortnite’s menu.

5. Select**Confirm Purchase** .

 Your PS5 will charge your wallet first before charging your card, even after selecting your card as the default payment method.
