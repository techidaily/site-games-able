## Cross-Platform Connectivity: Stream Deck's Secure Link to Your Desktop

 Valve's Steam Deck is fantastic for gaming on the go (or from the couch). Its semi-hidden killer feature, though, is how it also offers an actual desktop with access to countless apps. The catch is that the Steam Deck's inputs are optimized for gaming, and using a desktop with them can be a painful experience.You could purchase a USB hub, mouse, and keyboard, and stick them to your Deck for an authentic desktop experience. But why waste your money on redundant hardware when you're at your home base? If you already have a PC, Barrier allows you to "share" its mouse and keyboard with your Steam Deck. Let's see how.

## What Is Barrier?

 Barrier is the software equivalent of a KVM switch, enabling you to share your main PC's keyboard and mouse with other computers on the same network. Since the Steam Deck is a Linux PC "camouflaged" as a portable console, you can also control it through your primary PC.The only requirement is for your primary PC and Steam Deck to be connected to the same local network.

![Barrier GitHub Releases Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/barrier-github-releases-page.jpg)

 Download and install Barrier on your PC, and when done,**run** the app. Set its mode to**Server** , select that you want to**Configure** (it)**interactively** , and click on**Configure Server** .

![Barrier Configure Server Interactively](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/barrier-configure-server-interactively.jpg)

 You'll see a thumbnail representing your main PC's screen in the middle of a grid. You can**double-click** on any square in the grid to place your Steam Deck on that spot. The lines of the grid represent the "barriers" between monitors. When your mouse exits one of those barriers on one of the monitors, it will be "teleported" to the other device's monitor on the other side of the Barrier.

![Barrier Adding Steam Deck Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/barrier-adding-steam-deck-screen.jpg)

 Setting up Barrier to match your devices' physical layout is best. If you keep your Steam Deck on the left of your PC's monitor, place its Barrier "screen" on the left of your host PC.

![Barrier Steam Deck Screen Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/barrier-steam-deck-screen-settings.jpg)

 After you double-click on a spot on the grid, you'll have to enter a name for your Steam Deck in the field next to**Screen name** .You can leave the rest of the options as they are. When returning to Barrier's initial window, note the first of the**IP addresses** , for you'll have to input it on your Steam Deck in the next section.

## How to Set Up Barrier on Steam Deck

 To be able to follow along, make sure to switch your Steam Deck to its**Desktop mode** . For more on that, read our guide on [how to use the Steam Deck as a desktop replacement](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-steam-deck-as-a-desktop-replacement/) .To install Barrier, start by running KDE's**Discover** (Software Center).

![Steam Deck Discover Software Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-deck-discover-software-center.jpg)

 Use the search field (on the top left) to seek "barrier" and install it. When done, close the Discovery app, and search for "barrier" on the main menu (with the**Steam Deck logo** , on the left, where you'd expect to find Start on Windows). Alternatively, you'll find it in the**Utilities** section.

![Steam Deck Menu Running Barrier](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-deck-menu-running-barrier.jpg)

 Set this instance of Barrier to**Client** , and enter your host PC's IP address in the field next to**Server IP** .

![Steam Deck Barrier Client Mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-deck-barrier-client-mode.jpg)

 Click on the**Start** button on the bottom right of the Barrier client on your Steam Deck, and do the same for the Barrier server on your host PC.

![Barrier Server Running](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/barrier-server-running.jpg)

 Try moving your mouse cursor to the side where you've placed your Steam Deck's virtual monitor in Barrier. It should exit your screen and appear on the right side of your Steam Deck's desktop.

 You can return to your PC's desktop the same way by "jumping over" the same barrier between the two device's screens.

## How to Help Your Steam Deck and PC Connect With Each Other

 If Barrier on one of your devices can't see the other, don't fret: the following are the usual causes for such issues, and they're easy to solve.

### Check Your App Settings

 Activate Barrier's window on your host PC, and select**Barrier > Change Settings** or press**F4** on your keyboard. Make sure both**Enable SSL** and**Require client certificate** are disabled (no checkmark).Also, note the**Port** used, and ensure it's the same on the client (on the Steam Deck).

### Disable Any Firewalls

 On the Windows side, ensure your firewall grants access to Barrier. Check our guide on [how to allow apps through Windows firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) for more information on that.

### Check Your Router

 In rare cases, you might need to manually configure your router to "open" Barrier's port. Check our guide on [what are default open ports and should you change them](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-open-router-ports-their-security-implications/) , where we also cover how to open ports on a router.

## One For All

 Thanks to Barrier, you can easily use your Steam Deck's desktop with your main PC's keyboard and mouse.Even better, by setting up your devices' "screens" with the same layout as on your desk, the whole experience can feel as seamless as working on a single desktop.
