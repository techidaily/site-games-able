## Ideal High-Refresh Rate Gaming Screens

 While you can still play games with a standard 60Hz monitor, a high refresh rate monitor will take your gaming experience to the next level. There are plenty of options out there, but a 144Hz refresh rate monitor offers the perfect middle-ground between performance and price.

 And while a higher refresh rate is a more important factor than resolution for gaming, that doesn't mean you should settle for less. You can go all-in with a 4K 144Hz monitor for fast, smooth gaming with a high level of detail, or get a QHD or 1080p option for a budget-friendly pick.

Here are the best 144Hz monitors for gaming you can buy today.

 The LG UltaGear 27GP950-B offers gamers a 4K 144Hz experience on a 27-inch Nano IPS display with a 16:9 aspect ratio. With VESA DisplayHDR 600 certification, the monitor also boasts a comprehensive 98-percent DCI-P3 color gamut and 600 nits of peak brightness to deliver vivid, realistic color with precise detail.

 The Nano IPS panel also boasts a 178-degree viewing angle, allowing colors to remain saturated no matter where you’re seated in the room. The LG UltraGear 27GP950-B also incorporates VESA DSC, a cutting-edge technology that allows for a 4K resolution at high refresh rates without degrading image quality. And, with overclocking, you can push the monitor to refresh rates of up to 160Hz.

 It was also the first monitor to offer HDMI 2.1 support, allowing for optimum display quality when playing next-gen consoles. You get VRR support, which includes compatibility with G-SYNC and FreeSync Premium Pro. In addition, it has an excellent 1ms response time, eliminating almost all visible ghosting and blur. Finally, a rather cool-looking RGB ring on the rear enhances the whole show and creates a dynamic gaming ambiance.

 If you’re focused on a monitor with a plethora of gaming features, consider the Gigabyte M32U. It packs features such as Aim Stabilizer Sync to minimize blurring and Black Equalizer to help spot enemies in the shadows, among other valuable additions. It also includes all the bells and whistles you need, from HDMI 2.1 to a fast 1ms response time.

**Pros**

* Low input lag
* Rapid 1ms response time
* Excellent picture quality
* Lots of gaming features

**Cons**

* Speakers lack bass

 The Gigabyte M32U is a feature-rich 32-inch, 4K, 144Hz gaming monitor with a decent 1ms MPRT and support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. The build is sturdy, black plastic, and the display has an anti-glare matte finish with thin bezels. Additionally, it doesn’t feature RGB lighting, so if you aren’t keen on that look, the simple yet elegant-looking Gigabyte M32U could be for you.

 The monitor boasts HDMI 2.1 support, as well as one USB Type-C port for display input and power delivery. There’s also a DisplayPort 1.4, three USB-A downstream ports, one USB-B upstream, and a 3.5mm audio output. The display features 90 percent DCI-P3 coverage, 400 nits peak brightness, and support for 10-bit (8-bit plus Frame Rate Control) color depth.

 Some of the monitor’s standout features include Aim Stabilizer Sync, which reduces on-screen blurring, and Black Equalizer, which brightens dark areas of the display without affecting lighter spots. You also get Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture features that allow you to view two connected devices simultaneously. Finally, you have Game Assist for a plethora of helpful gaming features.

##### ASUS TUF Gaming VG249Q

Most Affordable

 A quality yet affordable 144Hz gaming monitor

 For those on a budget, the Asus TUF Gaming VG249Q offers gamers a 144Hz refresh rate and a fast 1ms MPRT response time. It’s a pocket-friendly option with a quality Full HD display with added features to make your gaming experience as high quality as possible.  

**Pros**

* Affordable
* Sturdy build
* Good image quality
* Excellent input lag

**Cons**

* No HDMI 2.1 or USB ports

[$224 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-VG249Q-Monitor-FreeSync-DisplayPort/dp/B0829S7178?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU94433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-144hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

 If you're looking for a 144Hz gaming experience on a budget, consider the ASUS VG249Q. It has a noticeably solid build, but choosing a pocket-friendly option means you’ll have to do without some of the features pricier monitors offer. Among these omissions is a lack of HDMI 2.1 and no USB ports.

 However, the 24-inch, 16:9 IPS panel with Full HD resolution is easy on the eyes, as well as your GPU. Colors are also lifelike and vibrant, with 100-percent sRGB coverage. Although the contrast can look slightly on the lower side for an IPS panel at times, it still offers sufficient detail and sharpness for its price range and can reach a peak brightness of 250 nits.

 The input lag is excellent, but the pixel response falls short of premium monitors. However, at 4ms (1ms MPRT), it’s still pretty good, and you can use the Trace Free overdrive settings to reduce ghosting and ELMB mode to improve motion blur. It’s a FreeSync gaming monitor that’s also compatible with G-Sync, so you can eliminate screen tearing and choppy frame rates no matter your GPU.

##### Sony Inzone M9

Best for PS5

 PS5 users can enjoy extra benefits with the Sony M9

 PS5 users can enjoy a few little bonuses if they opt for the Sony M9\. However, it's an excellent gaming monitor for any console with all the necessary features, from a 144Hz refresh rate to VRR and HDMI 2.1 support. It also has a bright and vibrant UHD display with full-array local dimming, ensuring an immersive gaming experience.

**Pros**

* 2x HDMI 2.1 ports and USB-C
* 178-degree wide viewing angle
* Tripod stand with adjustable height and tilt
* DisplayPort over USB-C
* Stunning 4K display

**Cons**

* Average sound quality from built-in speakers
* Cables not included (other than power cord)

[$898 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU94433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-144hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) [$898 at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sony-27-INZONE-M9-4K-HDR-144Hz-Gaming-Monitor-with-NVIDIA-G-SYNC-2022/1343626188) [$898 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F3D4-003X-00002) [$900 at Sony](https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/gaming-monitors/all-inzone-monitors/p/sdmu27m90)

 Sony has got plenty right with its first 4K gaming monitor. With the UHD resolution, the 16:9 IPS LCD panel, and accurate backlighting from the full-array local dimming, the monitor ensures video games and media content burst with detail and vibrant color.

 The Sony M9 also boasts DisplayHDR600 certification. This means you get to experience all the 95-percent DCI-P3 color coverage, exceptional detail, and all-around vibrancy with an excellent 600-nits peak brightness. It’s ideal for watching and playing HDR content, and you’ll quickly spot enemies lurking in the shadows.

 The monitor also boasts an excellent 1ms response time, which can easily keep up with the 144Hz refresh rate. The input lag is also exceptionally low, resulting in motion blur at untraceable levels around fast-moving objects. PC gamers can enjoy HDMI 2.1 support on both inputs and screen tearing and stuttering is non-existent with NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility.

 Sony has, of course, been slightly biased toward its loyal Playstation customers. With features such as Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode, Sony rewards PS5 users with that little bit extra.

 $699$900 Save $201

 The Acer Predator XB323QK is a gaming monitor with one of the fastest response times at 0.5ms (G to G). It has a large 31.5-inch display with a 4K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate and boasts HDMI 2.1 support. It’s a stylish-looking monitor with a vibrant and bright display that will satisfy all levels of gamers.  

**Pros**

* HDMI 2.1 and USB-C
* Stunning 4K display
* Can be found at excellent prices
* Ultra-fast response time

**Cons**

* Substandard speaker

[$699 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Predator-Monitor-FreeSync-Premium-LVbmiiphuzx/dp/B0BX712QZZ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU94433&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-144hz-gaming-monitors%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

 The Acer Predator XB323QK is a space-hogging 31.5-inch monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate, dual HDMI 2.1 ports, and NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility. It’s the perfect display for gaming PCs and next-gen consoles, with its 4K resolution and an Agile-Splendor IPS panel delivering a wide viewing angle.

 The response time is ultra-fast at up to 0.5ms (G to G), and you can set the display to one of eight modes, including Action, Eco, Graphics, HDR, Racing, Standard, and User. With a 90-percent DCI-P3 color gamut, you have a natural color that isn’t overly saturated, and with 400 nits peak brightness, the display is bright and detailed.

 It’s also a rather stylish black and chrome monitor with a customizable LED rear light. The stand is adjustable; you can tilt and pivot the screen to get the perfect angle. However, one design flaw is that the ports, including the power jack, are on the bottom of the monitor, which can be tricky when connecting your devices. On top of the HDMI 2.1 ports, there is also a USB-C port, as well as USB-A and B, one DisplayPort, and an audio output.

 If you feel you need a wider field of view for a competitive advantage, an ultrawide monitor like the LG 38WN95C-W could be a great investment. The impressive 38-inch Nano IPS curved screen is anti-reflective and offers a QHD+ resolution at 3840x1600p with a 144Hz refresh rate. It also has an incredibly low input lag and a 1ms response time. The viewing angle is also wide at 178 degrees, which is ideal for co-op gaming. However, the contrast ratio is relatively low, which may disappoint in a darkened room.

 A monitor with these specs not only suffices for gaming but if you need one for productivity and entertainment, too. While it is a premium-priced monitor, the color gamut has a 98-percent DCI-P3 coverage. Together with VESA DisplayHDR600 certification, you can enjoy more than just gaming. Movies look fantastic, content creators can enjoy finely detailed images, and the display is crisp, sharp, and bright for day-to-day productivity.

 Gamers can enjoy VRR support with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync Compatible technologies helping to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering. However, the monitor does not support HDMI 2.1, but there are two HDMI 2.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3 USB-Type C port with 94W power delivery. This means you can charge your laptop as you feed video to the monitor.

 If a 21:9 aspect ratio isn’t immersive enough, why not go for a super ultrawide 32:9? The LG 49WQ95C-W is a curved, panoramic behemoth that offers gamers enhanced immersion and improved peripheral vision. It’s an excellent choice for first-person shooters and racing games, but if you are a multitasker, this monitor splits into two, allowing you to game while keeping an eye on other tasks. The only downside is that you’ll definitely need to measure your desk before purchasing.

 It has a Dual Quad HD display with a Nano IPS screen, a 144Hz refresh rate, and a 178-degree viewing angle. Input lag is low, and the response time is pretty good at 5ms and fast enough for casual to mid-tier gamers. It’s compatible with NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro for reducing screen tears and stuttering.

 The display is color-accurate with 98 percent DCI-P3 coverage and a peak brightness that can hit 400 nits. The surprisingly good sound from the dual 10W speakers compliments the beautiful display, although when splitting the screen, you must choose which one plays the audio.

 You also have two HDMI 2.1 ports to get the maximum from any next-gen console you possess, a USB-C offering 90W power delivery, a DisplayPort, two USB-As, and a headphone jack. LG also provides all the cables for HDMI, DisplayPort, and even a USB-C.

## Choosing the Right 144Hz Monitor for You

 144Hz monitors are available with a variety of resolutions. While refresh rate is a more critical factor over resolution, if you have the budget, you can opt for a 4K monitor and enjoy exceptional detail. You also need your monitor to have a good response time. Casual to mid-tier gamers can opt for 5ms or less, but if you’re a serious gamer, you should look at 1ms or even faster.

 You’ll also need a monitor with G-SYNC or FreeSync compatibility to help reduce screen tearing and stuttering, but you should also check if your graphics card is powerful enough to drive a 144Hz monitor. Next-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X gamers will need HDMI 2.1 support to get the most out of their consoles. One of the best monitors to offer all this and more with additional gaming features is the Gigabyte M32U. It's a 4K monitor with a stunning display and includes all the vital features, and some more, that are helpful to gamers.

 However, budget is also a primary concern. Opting for FHD or QHD over UHD is a good option to save some bucks. The ASUS TUF Gaming VG249Q is a highly affordable monitor with enough about it to deliver excellent 144Hz gaming.

 The best overall 144Hz gaming monitor is the LG UltraGear 27GP950-B. It might be a little pricier than others in this category, but it has a stunning 4K resolution with a 1ms response time. It can also get pretty bright and is perfect for HDR gaming and movies. It also boasts HDMI 2.1, and you can overclock the refresh rate to 160Hz.
