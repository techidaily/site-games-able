## Best Overall Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Hori Game Card Case 24
![Hori Nintendo Switch Catridge Holder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hori-nintendo-switch-catridge-holder.jpg)

HORI

 The officially licensed [HORI Game Card Case](https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Game-Nintendo-Switch-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01NASY99Z?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) should be perfect for most Switch owners. Despite its compact size, it can hold up to 24 games. That goes a long way toward clearing out all the video game cases clogging up your entertainment center. And when you decide to hit the road with your Switch, you have a simple way to bring two dozen games with you.

 Cartridges are easy to pop in and out of their holding slot, and you'll also find a memory card holder for your SD card. The entire case is solid and durable, though it is a bit bland, as it features nothing more than a semi-transparent exterior and small Nintendo Switch branding.

![HORI Switch Holder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hori-switch-holder.png)

## Best Budget Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case
![Hyperkin catridge holder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hyperkin-catridge-holder.jpg)

Hyperkin

 It doesn't carry many games, but the [Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case](https://www.amazon.com/8-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07TR7H11H?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is both affordable and compact. It can hold eight cartridges, is built from thick and durable plastic, and features well-designed slots that allow for easy access while still securing your games in place. Eight cartridges might be a bit on the low end for Switch owners who've been playing for years, but when you consider how cheap the case is, there's no denying it poses great value.

 Hyperkin is also a trusted name in the third-party product market, with a variety of popular controllers, cases, and portable consoles in its catalog. That means you shouldn't have any reliability issues with the 8-in-1 carrying case even though it's the cheapest cartridge holder on this list.

##### Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case

Best Budget

 Though it only holds eight games, the Hyperkin Retro Style Cartridge Case is durable, secure, and highly affordable.

**Pros**

* Compact
* Secure slots and durable exterior
* Great price

**Cons**

* Only holds 8 games
* Boring design

[$10 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/8-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07TR7H11H?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce)

## Most Compact Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Amazon Basics Game Storage Case
![Amazon Basics Catridge Holder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/amazon-basics-catridge-holder.jpg)

Amazon

 Amazon seems to make everything these days, but you might be shocked to learn that it also has a lineup of Switch storage cases. The aptly named [Amazon Basics Game Storage Case](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Game-Storage-Case-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0725Z64TF?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) holds up to 24 games, is available in blue, black, or red, and is backed by a one-year limited warranty.

 While it's nice that the case is available in three colors, it's still a bit bland (offering little to catch your eye beyond its colorful, transparent design). Aside from that quirk, there's little to dislike here. At just over three inches wide and three inches long, it's one of the most compact cases on the market. It's also just an inch thick, so you should have no problem tossing it in a suitcase or backpack when heading out on an adventure.

Its strong exterior protects the cartridges from scratches, while the foam-fitted interior stops them from getting knocked loose while in transit.

 This version of the case features a unique Mario "M" design, though you can find other designs inspired by Zelda and Minecraft. It'll only hold 12 games, and it's quite expensive, but it is undoubtedly a great choice for frequent travelers seeking a bit of style.

### Q: What is the best way to store my Switch cartridges?

 There's no "best" way to store Switch cartridges, though many folks love the compact and portable nature of Switch cartridge cases. Using their original cases is also a good option, though they take up much more space.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Q: Why should I store my Switch cartridges in a holder instead of a Switch case?

 If you don't want dozens of Switch cases littering your home, a Switch cartridge holder is a great option. This also makes it easy to pack up and hit the road, as all your games are already stowed away in a case that can quickly be tossed in a bag before leaving home.

### Q: Is it better to purchase a physical or digital version of a Switch game?

 This is all about personal preference. Digital games are always available on your Switch, but can quickly take up space on your SD card or built-in storage. Physical games can often be found on sale and don't require as much storage on your Switch.
