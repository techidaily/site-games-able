## Stealth Mode: Playing Quietly on Xbox One

 The immersive experience of gaming on an Xbox is enhanced by the dynamic feedback of vibrations and sounds that emanate from the Xbox controller and console. These features add depth and realism and enhance your overall gaming experience. However, there may be times when you want to turn off these sounds and vibrations for a while.

 Fortunately, the manufacturers of Xbox understand this need and have integrated settings that allow you to silence both your console and controller, offering you a personalized gaming experience tailored to your preferences. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to silence your Xbox Series X|S or One console and controller.

 Silencing your Xbox console and controller can be beneficial in several situations. For instance, when gaming late at night or in a quiet environment, muting the controller and console prevents loud noises and vibrations from disturbing others.

 The ability to silence your Xbox controller becomes particularly valuable during intense gaming sessions, especially when there's a lot of firing or shooting involved. In these action-packed moments, a constantly vibrating controller can be overwhelming. Additionally, turning off vibrations on your controller can conserve its battery life, ensuring extended gaming sessions and reducing the need for frequent battery recharging or replacements.

 Remember that silencing your Xbox controller and console is entirely optional and depends on what enhances your gaming experience. If you do not wish to mute the sounds completely, you can also adjust the [sound settings on your Xbox](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-xs-sound-settings/) to fit your preferences.

 You’ll see several audio-related settings, such as**Mute navigation sounds** ,**Mute notification sounds** ,**Power chime** , and**Mute startup sounds** , that can be enabled or disabled to suit your preferences.

 The first two settings are related to the sounds you hear on your console when you receive a notification or navigate around the Xbox dashboard or through menus and settings. The latter settings pertain to the sounds the Xbox console device makes upon turning on and off.

 To mute any or all of these sounds, simply select the respective setting and press**A** on your Xbox controller to enable it. However, for the**Power Chime** setting, you have two options to customize the sound behavior.
