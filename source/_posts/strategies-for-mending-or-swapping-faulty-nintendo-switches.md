## Strategies for Mending or Swapping Faulty Nintendo Switches

 It's inevitable that, at some point, you will experience hardware issues with your consoles. Luckily, If you happen to be experiencing problems with your Nintendo Switch, the process for booking an official repair with Nintendo is straightforward and may even be free.

 However, many factors determine how the repair process for your Nintendo Switch will work, like the warranty status of your console. But, if you need to look into repairing your Nintendo Switch, we can help.

## How to Find the Serial Number of Your Nintendo Switch

 The first thing you need to be aware of when looking to repair your Switch with Nintendo is how to find its serial number. This is required throughout Nintendo's repair process.

 Generally, you can find a label detailing the serial number on your Switch itself. However, the model and make of your console determines where this label will be. For an original Switch, the serial number is on the console's base. But for the OLED Switch, it's located under the stand.

 Alternatively, the box that your Switch came in, if purchased new, will have the serial number on it as well. But even with these methods, the serial numbers on your Switch may fade over time, and there's no guarantee the box serial number is original. Luckily, there is a universal way to discover your console's serial number.

 To find the serial number of your Switch, regardless of its model, turn your console on and follow these steps:

* From the Home screen of your Nintendo Switch, select**System Settings** .
* Under the left-hand-side options, highlight**System** .
* Select**Serial Numbers** .

![A screenshot of the System Settings of a Nintendo Switch with System options highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023101011401400-57b4628d2267231d57e0fc1078c0596d.jpg)

 From here, your console serial number and those of the battery and Joy-Con will be displayed on-screen. However, while this method works universally, if your Switch is non-functioning or won't turn on, you'll have to find the serial number by analyzing your console or its original box.

## Check Your Nintendo Switchâ€™s Warranty Status

 Now you know the serial number of your Switch, you can move on with checking the warranty status of your console and booking a repair. It's important to check the warranty status of your Switch beforehand as if your console is under warranty, Nintendo will likely repair your console for free.

 Luckily, if you have the serial number of your Switch on hand, the process of checking the warranty status of your console is simple. To check the warranty status of your Switch, follow these steps:

* Enter the official Nintendo Repair Center page on any browser by following this link to [Nintendo](https://repair.nintendo.com/cc/ntndcpWarrantyStatus.html?lang=en) .
* Under**Check Warranty Status** , enter the serial number of your Nintendo Switch.
* Select**Check Warranty** .

![A screenshot of the Check Warranty Status page of the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3058.jpg)

 Under**Warranty Information** , Nintendo will then provide all the details of your console's warranty status, including whether it is under warranty and the**Warranty Expiration Date** .

 Unfortunately, if your console is out of warranty, you will have to pay for the repair of your console. Similarly, screen damage voids the warranty of your Switch, and screen repairs are not covered under the warranty.

 However, it may be worth checking some [common fixes for Nintendo Switch problems](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-nintendo-switch-problems/) before booking a repair. This way, you may avoid any repair fees if your console is out of warranty.

## How to Book Your Nintendo Switch In for a Repair

 If you have decided to go ahead with repairing your Nintendo Switch officially, with or without the free price tag that comes with the warranty of your Nintendo Switch, there are a few requirements you'll need to go through beforehand.

 Just as if you were [booking a repair for your Joy-Con](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-send-joy-cons-off-for-free-repair/) , or any other aspect of your Switch, the repair process requires you to access the Nintendo Repair Center via the [official Nintendo website](https://repair.nintendo.com/cc/cpSignIn.html?) . From here, you can start your repair process by following these steps:

* Select**Start Troubleshooting** .

![A screenshot of the main menu of the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3061.jpg)

* Follow the on-screen instructions and select**Start a Nintendo Switch System Repair** .

![A screenshot of the troubleshooting information for a Nintendo Switch repair](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3064.jpg)

* Select the option below**General Troubleshooting** that best defines the fault with your Nintendo Switch.

![A screenshot of the General Troubleshooting options of the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3067.jpg)

* Follow the on-screen troubleshooting guides for your selected issue, and select**Start a repair** .

![A screenshot of the Start a Repair option available within the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3070.jpg)

* Enter the**Product Information** , including the**Serial Number** , of your Nintendo Switch, and select**Continue** .

![A screenshot of the required Product Information when booking a repair via the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3079.jpg)

 The Nintendo Repair Center will then quote you a fee for how much the repair will cost. If your Switch is under warranty and not affected by screen damage this fee should be waived. To confirm the repair, select**Continue** .

![A screenshot of the finalized Repair Details for a Nintendo Switch repair via the Nintendo Repair Center](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3082.jpg)

 You will now need to enter any personal information relevant to the repair process and confirm your methods of delivery to and from the repair center. Once this has been completed, you need to pay for the repair. But with the repair paid for and delivery confirmed, you have successfully booked a repair for your Nintendo Switch.

## Repair Your Nintendo Switch in the Most Effective Way Possible

 By following the official steps outlined by the Nintendo Repair Center, you can guarantee that you are focusing the repair process for your Switch on your exact requirements. And with Nintendo accommodating the wavering of fees automatically, if your console is under warranty, you may even receive a price reduction.

 While the repair form may be quite long and exact, by selecting your preferred delivery methods and time frame, you can hone the process to be the most effective means for you. And this makes the headache of repairing broken hardware all the easier.
