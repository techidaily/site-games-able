## Game Pass Integration: The Future of Xbox Live Gold

 Xbox Live Gold will be replaced by Xbox Game Pass Core starting from September 2023.

 If you're an avid Xbox gamer, you'll likely be wondering what this change means for you. Let's find out.

## What Changes Will Xbox Game Pass Core Bring?

 If you regularly play on Xbox you will likely want to know what the change to Xbox Game Pass Core means for you. Your subscription will automatically change from Xbox Live Gold to Xbox Game Pass Core on September 14th, 2023 when the change takes place. Your pricing stays the same. Upon the immediate change, you will then have access to a library of over 25 games, as per a post on[Xbox Wire](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/17/xbox-game-pass-core/) that originally broke the news.

 As the announcement details, Games With Gold will also be retired along with the Xbox Live Gold package, but don't worry; any games you claimed using the service when it was active will remain in your library forever.

 Essentially, nothing will change from your end. You can continue to enjoy access to multiplayer and pay the same monthly fee—with the added bonus of 25 free games to play. There are potential[reasons Game Pass could become more expensive over time](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-xbox-game-pass-will-get-more-expensive/) , but that won't be happening in the initial switchover period from Xbox Live Gold to Game Pass Core.

## Is the Change to Xbox Game Pass Core a Good Thing?

 It's reasonable to feel a little dubious when a game company introduces a change to a service you pay for. The industry as a whole has proven to be no strangers to taking as much of your money as possible.

 Consider, however, that this change could be good. There are no changes to your monthly fee or your actual service benefits, instead the overall service Xbox offers for online play and rental games has been condensed into one name. Having Xbox Live Gold and then Xbox Game Pass is needlessly convoluted. Now it is simply Xbox Game Pass with a three-tiered subscription plan.

 The only thing that will change from the gamer's perspective, is that you'll have 25 games you can immediately play that you may not have owned before. It's a win for you, and if it encourages you to upgrade to a higher tier of Xbox Game Pass, then it's a win for Xbox. A fair update in the grand scheme of things.

## Xbox Live Gold Is on the Way Out

 Xbox Live Gold has been part of the Xbox service since the Xbox 360 announcement in 2005\. Before that, it was simply Xbox Live on the original Xbox. In September 2023, this service will be put to bed, making way for Xbox Game Pass Core.

 If you currently subscribe to the Xbox Live Gold subscription, be reassured that nothing will change on your end, except for the name of the plan you subscribe to.
