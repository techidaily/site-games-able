 No matter the reason, you can change Steam’s default language by going through the steps below.

1. Launch the Steam client.
2. Open the Steam menu from the top-left corner and select**Settings** .
3. From the left pane, click**Interface** .
4. Open the drop-down menu below**Select the language you wish Steam to use** and select a new language.

 Now, if you need more control over the language settings, you’ll have to sign in. Then, click your username and go to**Preferences** . There, open the**Language Preferences** menu.

 Use the**Primary section** to select your preferred language. If your preferred language isn’t that common among game developers, it’s better to choose one of the options from the**Secondary language** section.

## How to Change Steam Language for a Specific Game

 If you share your Steam account with other people, it might make sense to change the default language for individual games.
