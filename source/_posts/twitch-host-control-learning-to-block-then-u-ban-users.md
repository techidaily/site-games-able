## Twitch Host Control: Learning to Block, Then U-Ban Users

 If someone is getting on your nerves on Twitch, it's very easy to block them to prevent their messages from appearing on your screen.

 However, if you accidentally block someone, or you're feeling benevolent enough to give someone a second chance, it's a little trickier to unblock someone again.

Here's how to block or unblock someone on Twitch...

## How to Block Someone on Twitch

 Twitch has become a major player in the video game world and has attracted a wide range of different people as a result. Hopefully, the majority of the people you'll meet will be friendly, but there will always be the odd troll here and there.

 If someone is being annoying on Twitch, blocking them is easy: just click on their**Twitch name** . If you're on mobile, you should see the**Block** option pop up in the user menu that pops up.

 If you're on a PC, you need to click on the**three dots** at the bottom right of the profile card that pops up. Then, click**Block \[name\]** .

 Twitch will quickly remind you what a blocked person can and cannot do. In short, once you block someone, they can't whisper you, host you, add you as a friend, or gift [Twitch subscriptions](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/twitch-complete-guide-buying-subscriptions/) to your channel.

 If you're okay with this, click**Block** .

 Twitch won't retroactively scrub away the person's messages, so if they said something particularly nasty, refresh the page to clear the chat and get rid of their comments.

 Alternatively, you can type**/block \[username\]** into the chat to get rid of them.

## How to Unblock People on Twitch: The Easiest Way

 When you want to unblock someone, however, things get a little more complicated. You can unblock someone by clicking on their card and selecting**Unblock** . But this only works for a very recent block.

 The problem is, if you blocked the person a long time ago, you won't see their messages anymore. If you can't see their messages, you can't click their name to unblock them!

 If you know what the user's exact name is, you can**type /unblock \[username\]** to bring them back. However, if you can't remember their name, you'll need to do some extra work.

## How to Unblock People on Twitch Using Settings

 To unblock someone on Twitch on your PC, do the following. First, click on your profile at the top right, then click**Settings** .

![twitch settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/twitch-settings-menu.png)

 Click on the**Security and Privacy** tab at the top. Next, scroll down to the**Privacy** section, then find the**Blocked Users** section.

## How to Unblock People on the Twitch App

 If you're using an Android phone, you'll quickly discover that unblocking someone via the official Android app can be a huge pain. This is because, weirdly enough, the Android app is missing a feature that the iOS version has.

 Here are the best ways to unblock people on Twitch on iOS and Android...

### How to Unblock People on iOS

 If you do use iOS, you're in luck. Here's how you can unblock someone:

1. Just boot up the app and tap on your**profile image** at the top left.
2. Then, tap on**Settings** , then**Security & Privacy** .
3. Scroll down to the bottom of this page to see your blocked users. You can then remove a user from your blocked list by tapping**Unblock** at the right-hand side of the user's name if you want to be able to receive messages from them again.

### How to Unblock People on Android

 If you're on Android, you'll find that you can follow the above instructions word-for-word, right up until the point where a blocked user list is supposed to appear. Strangely, the blocked user list never made it over from iOS.

 As such, a quick and hassle-free way to unblock someone on Android is by using Twitch's desktop site on your device. Just head over to Twitch and load the desktop version of the site (here's a guide on how you can [view the desktop version of any site](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-view-desktop-version-of-any-site-on-mobile/) ). After that, follow the steps above for unblocking Twitch users via Settings.

 If you don't want to use this method, we'd recommend logging into your Twitch account on PC to manage your blocked users list instead.
