Nordik

 The [Nordik Cork Leather Desk Mat](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B094JQ2T73?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-desk-mats%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is as premium as it gets. Available in a variety of colors, this desk mat uses a two-texture surface for enhanced usability. The top is synthetic vegan leather, offering your workspace a luxurious look and serving as a water-resistant layer. The back is a soft cork which prevents the mat from slipping around during use and won't damage your desktop.

 Nordik went all out with the finishing touches on this desk mat, including premium features such as stitched edges for durability and a built-in cable organizer. It can get expensive, but it's hard to beat this great product if you need the best desk mat on the market.

## Best Budget Desk Mat: YSAGi Leather Desk Pad Protector ![YSAGi PU leather desk mat with a laptop, mouse, phone, and notebook on top](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ysagi-1.jpg)

YSAGi

 You don't need to spend heaps of money to get a reliable desk mat. The [YSAGi Leather Desk Pad](https://www.amazon.com/YSAGi-Leather-Protector-Non-Slip-Waterproof/dp/B0BVVR6FNY?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-desk-mats%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) proves just that, with a variety of styles and sizes up for grabsâ€”all of which are stylish, durable, and perfect for all types of users. And while it's usually incredibly affordable anyway, it frequently goes on sale, making it all the more enticing.

 Though its materials aren't quite as fancy as the premium leather desk mats, the YSAGi mat uses a similar two-layer approach. The top is PU leather that's waterproof and protects from scratches, while the back is a suede-type material that secures the mat in place during use. Be sure to give it a look if you need something affordable, protective, and highly customizable.

## Best Desk Mat for Gaming: Razer Gigantus V2 ![Razer Gigantus V2 desk mat in various sizes on top of each other](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gigantus-1.jpg)

Razer

 Razer is an icon in the gaming world, so it should be no surprise that it produces the best desk mat for gamers. The [Gigantus V2](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gigantus-Cloth-Gaming-Medium/dp/B088539GLT?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-desk-mats%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is perfect for gaming, thanks to multiple available sizes, an anti-slip base, and high-density foam construction. Best of all, it uses a premium textured micro-weave cloth surface for enhanced control over your mouse movements during intense gaming sessions.

 Whether you need something for a compact desk or sprawling battle station, you'll find a Gigantus V2 that fits your setup. And while Razer loves to create gadgets with edgy gamer aesthetics, this desk mat is surprisingly understated. The top is black with a few neon green accents, while the bottom is bright neon green (though you'll only see the edges once placed on your desk). In other words, both gamers and non-gamers should find something to love about this premium work surface.

Logitech

 Although it's only available in one size, the [Logitech Desk Mat Studio Series](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Desk-Mat-Multifunctional-Spill-Resistant/dp/B09DV8WKK8?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-desk-mats%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is ideal for small desks. At around 27 inches x 12 inches, it should fit on most tiny desktops, giving you a premium way to protect your surface and improve your productivity.

## Best Mouse Pad: SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad ![SteelSeries (3)](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/steelseries-3.jpg)

SteelSeries

 Desk mats are essentially elongated mouse pads, as they're often built from the same material and offer many of the same perks. But if you're looking for a true mouse pad, the [SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000UVRU6G?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-desk-mats%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the one to get.

 As you'd expect, this mouse pad has a durable, non-slip rubber base, a high thread count for improved mouse performance, and premium materials that won't easily wear out. It's only available in black, but if you don't mind its minimalist design, there's little else to complain about with this deluxe mouse pad.

## FAQ

### Q: What is a desk mat?

 A desk mat is a large piece of material (often a soft fabric) that sits on top of a desk. It's used for a variety of reasons, including protection for the desk, as a surface for a mouse, and as a comfortable place to rest your hands.

### Q: What is the difference between a desk mat and mouse pad?

 A desk mat is essentially a very large mouse pad. Desk mats are often made from the same material as mouse pads, but they're large enough to house both a mouse and keyboard, and often other accessories.

### Q: Why would I use a desk mat instead of a mouse pad?

 If you're concerned about damaging the surface of your desk, a desk mat is a better option than a mouse pad. They also provide a nice aesthetic to your workspace, pulling everything together in the same way a rug works for a large room.

### Q: What is the best material for a desk mat?

 There's really no best material for a desk mat, as it largely comes down to personal preference. However, most users will find cork, felt, polyester, and microfiber to offer a nice combination of performance and style.
