The[iVoler Docking Station](http://www.amazon.com/Docking-Station-iVoler-Support-Charging/dp/B0B46337V4?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2027251&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-rog-ally-docks%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) offers an affordable solution for playing your favorite games on your TV in stunning 4K@60Hz. It also includes three USB ports, HDMI, and a USB-C port for fast charging your device.

### Q: Is the ROG Ally basically a PC?

 Yes, much like the Steam Deck, the Asus ROG Ally is just a PC in a handheld form factor.

### Q: Can the ASUS ROG Ally play Steam games?

 Yes, you can. Not only will the ASUS ROG Ally run Steam games, but you can run games available on Windows, GOG, Epic Games, Xbox Game Pass, and beyond.

### Q: How do I put the ROG Ally into docked mode?

 On the original ASUS ROG Ally Charging Dock, you'll see three ports: HDMI, USB-C, and USB-A.

* Plug the charging dock into an outlet.
* Connect an HDMI cable from the external monitor to the HDMI port on the charging dock.
* Now plug in a USB-C cable from the ASUS ROG Ally to the USB-C port on the charging dock.

 Once you've done that, you're good to go! Your ASUS ROG Ally is now a dedicated desktop PC. You're welcome to use the remaining USB-A port for a Bluetooth dongle or connect wirelessly to the handheld itself.
