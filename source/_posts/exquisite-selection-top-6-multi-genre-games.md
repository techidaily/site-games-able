## 1\. Among Us

![A level map in Among Us](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-level-map-in-among-us.jpg)

 Among Us is something of a cultural phenomenon. It is a mafia-styled social game that exploded in popularity at the height of the pandemic. The game’s success can be attributed to its social component and the capacity to create chaos with a group of friends, ultimately earning a fun few hours.

 It’s a great game to play on stream because viewers can pick up on what’s happening easily, regardless of when they hop on. What’s more? There is a lot of depth to the way the game can be played, with various roles and a wide selection of maps.

 There are two primary factions in Among Us: the Crewmates and the Impostors. The Crewmates are meant to work together and complete different outlined tasks on the map. They win when all these tasks are completed, regardless of how many Crewmates are left alive.

 The impostors, on the other hand, operate with the focus of killing off all the Crewmates. They can either achieve this by killing each individual or mass victory via sabotage.

 The best part? A lot more depth can be added to the game with extra roles and cosmetics when you[learn how to download and install Among Us mods](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-among-us-mods/) .

## 2\. Only Up

![The factory level in Only Up!](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-factory-level-in-only-up.jpg)

 Platform puzzle games became a lot more popular under the sub-genre of Foddian games. But[what are Foddian games](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-foddian-games/) , and how does Only Up! fit in this category?

 Well, a player’s primary objective is to reach the top of the map by hopping from platform to platform. While Only Up! follows this general format, it is unique because of its 3D nature.

 The game was popular with French viewers initially and was brought to the attention of English viewers when the YouTube content creator, Ludwig, began to play it on his streams. It later blew up on Twitch as popular creators on the platform began to attempt to complete the game in as little time as possible.

 Naturally, Only Up! also appeals to the speedrunning community, which has also contributed to its growth and popularity. The platformer is incredibly fun to watch, thanks to how easy it is to gauge a creator’s progress.

 Viewers can either side with their favorite streamers and hope they finish quickly, or wait for the inevitable mistake that would cause them to fall to the very beginning. Either way, there’s a lot of entertainment to be had and great clips to be made.

## 3\. Fall Guys

![The Fall Guys home page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-fall-guys-home-page.jpg)

 Fall Guys is what happens when you take the popular Battle Royale genre and change the formula completely. It mixes the fun of a party game that can be enjoyed with friends with the nail-biting action of the large lobby, quick elimination format.

 Fall Guys was a great success when it first launched but did even better when Epic Games acquired the company behind it. The game was re-released as free to play and put up on the Epic Store for all PC and console players to enjoy. This is also[why Fall Guys disappeared from Steam](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-fall-guys-disappeared-from-steam/) .

 The family-friendly nature of the game, mixed with its competitive community, has made it a mainstay in Twitch Rivals events and other such tournaments. And while it’s not as popular as it once was, it still remains one of the best games to play on stream.

 This is because, while mechanically rewarding, Fall Guys doesn’t require total concentration to play. Thus, allowing streamers to interact with their viewers and keep them interested.

## 4\. Jump King

 Another title under the Foddian genre that gathers curious eyes is Jump King. Jump King is one of the original three that helped develop the Foddian genre, paving the way for games like Only Up!, Bread and Fred, and more.

 Jump King is a traditional 2D platformer with a single objective. A player is meant to guide the noble knight to the top of the level, upon which awaits a bodacious babe. While simple in concept, the execution is a lot deeper. The game is divided into levels with different themes. Some levels have environmental effects that affect how the knight moves, stands, and jumps.

 Speaking of jumps, jumping and moving the knight is the only mechanic in the game. However, it is one that players will need to master if they intend to succeed. The base game can be completed in under 10 minutes with enough practice, which is why it is a great beginner game for new speedrunners.

 Jump King is great to watch for the same reasons as Only Up!, as viewers can tune in at any time and still get invested in the game. They will stick around for the highs and lows of attempting to get to the highest point of the game—including every stumble, every fall, and every close call.

## 5\. Tricky Towers

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Tricky Towers allows you to test your stacking skills against as many as three other players. The shapes are similar to what you would see in Tetris, and the game rewards people who are geometrically perceptive.

 There are a few different game modes, but the most common is a build race. A player is meant to construct a solid tower that can resist the elements all the way to the finish line. You have no idea what shapes will come your way until they start drifting down toward your tower.

 As such, it‘s up to you to make the piece fit and preserve the integrity of your creation. The first to build their tower up to the finish line wins.

 Naturally, there will be a lot of twists and turns during a great game of Tricky Towers with friends. The banter that spawns makes for incredible laughs that are sure to keep your viewers entertained.

 All in all, Tricky Towers is an incredible game for any variety streamer to have in their tool belt.

## 6\. Goose Goose Duck

![Players voted out of a game of Goose Goose Duck](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/players-voted-out-of-a-game-of-goose-goose-duck.jpg)

 Goose Goose Duck is another title that has managed to build on the classic Mafia game structure. It’s another social game that has two factions: the geese, who are trying to finish assigned tasks with the hopes of winning the game, and the ducks, who are intent on killing every goose on the screen for a win.

 While similar, Goose Goose Duck is completely free and has a lot more features and maps than the base version of Among Us. Among Us requires mods and packs for more roles, cosmetics, and custom game modes. Goose Goose Duck, on the other hand, has all of this in the base game.

 One feature that really takes the game to the next level is the in-built proximity chat. This helps create funnier moments on stream that your viewers will absolutely love. There’s also a lot of content to explore, like intricate maps, unique roles, and exciting game modes.

**Download** : Goose Goose Duck on[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568590/Goose%5FGoose%5FDuck/) ,[Google Play](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2029497/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gaggle.fun.GooseGooseDuck&hl=en&gl=US) , or the[Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goose-goose-duck/id1558248707) .
