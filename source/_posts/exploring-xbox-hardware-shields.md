## Exploring Xbox Hardware Shields

 Being able to customize your gaming accessories can be a massive aspect of how you choose to play on your favorite platform. And with custom shells for consoles and controllers, you can fine-tune your gaming tech to your preference.

 But aside from limited edition consoles, owning a uniquely customized Xbox Series X is quite tricky. Yet with Xbox Series X Console Wraps, you can purchase officially licensed console shells that provide an element of customization for your Series X. But what are Xbox Console Wraps, and how do they work? Let's find out.

## What Are Xbox's Official Xbox Series X Console Skins?

 Officially licensed by Microsoft and Xbox, Xbox Console Wraps allows you to represent your favorite games and customize your Xbox Series X without spending too much money on a time-exclusive limited edition console.

 Through Xbox Console Wraps, Xbox can make official designs related to Xbox titles available for you to purchase as a shell wrap for your Xbox Series X console. For Xbox Game Studios releases, like Bethesda's Starfield, instead of releasing an overpriced exclusive console, you can buy an official Starfield Xbox Console Wrap for your current Series X.

 At the same time, some of the official designs used when[creating an Xbox controller through Design Labs](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-xbox-design-lab-to-create-a-custom-xbox-controller/) are also available as an Xbox Console Wrap. This means that classic Xbox designs, like the Arctic Camo Xbox Wireless Controller design, are available for your Series X as a shell for your console.

 But while Xbox Console Wraps provide much-needed and affordable customization for your Series X, console shells can be quite risky when it comes to the safety of your Series X. Luckily, Xbox has some key pieces of info addressing this.

## The Key Things You Need to Know About Xbox Console Wraps

 With console safety being a prime concern, especially regarding heat flow, you may have a few lingering questions about Xbox Console Wraps. Or, you might just be wondering how secure each Console Wrap is.

 Fortunately, Xbox has addressed safety issues to reinforce the practicality of Xbox Console Wraps and provided specific information regarding the ventilation of your Series X. From this, the key points associated with Xbox Console Wraps safety are as follows:

* Xbox has specifically designed Xbox Console Wraps for a custom and precise fit. And with the performance of your Series X placed as a core concern, Xbox says that ventilation is unimpeded.
* To further ensure ventilation, each Xbox Console Wrap has small feet fitted to its base, allowing for uninterrupted airflow at the base of your Series X.
* In terms of sturdiness, according to Xbox, every Console Wrap is made from high-tech fabric and features silicon panels on the interior of each Wrap.
* Finally, each Xbox Console Wrap uses a hook and loop mechanism that secures the Console Wrap and ensures it remains affixed to your console.

But while your safety concerns may be satisfied, the pricing and the release dates of all the available Console Wraps may be as important.
