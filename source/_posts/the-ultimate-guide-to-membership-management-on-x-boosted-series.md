## The Ultimate Guide to Membership Management on X Boosted Series

 Managing your gaming subscriptions conveniently can be the incentive that keeps you using a service rather than forcing you to cancel for fear of being trapped within monthly payments. Luckily, Xbox allows you to manage all your Xbox-orientated subscriptions straight from your Series X|S.

 While there are some caveats with managing subscriptions from your Xbox, you can still renew, cancel, and generally manage Xbox subscriptions solely from your console. But what are these caveats, and how do you manage subscriptions on Xbox? Let's find out.

## What You Need to Know About Managing Subscriptions From Your Xbox

 Before looking to manage your subscriptions, there are some specific details you need to know about doing so from your Xbox. To be specific, you should expect to face some of the following complications when attempting to manage subscriptions on your Xbox Series X|S:

* While your Xbox Series X|S has a built-in**Subscriptions** menu, some of the features will redirect you to the Microsoft Edge app instead of using the more convenient settings of your Xbox.
* You will be able to see all the past subscriptions of your Xbox account via the**Subscriptions** settings on your Xbox, but not subscriptions you are yet to use.
* The**Subscriptions** settings on your Xbox support specific features. These features include: changing your subscription plan, turning recurring billing on or off, checking your billing history, changing payment method, and canceling or renewing a subscription.

 If you need to manage your subscriptions outside the available features of the**Subscriptions** settings, or if you want to join a new subscription, you may need to use an alternative way to manage subscriptions.

 Luckily, just like how you can[cancel your Xbox Game Pass subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-cancel-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription/) online or from your console, you can do the same with all other Xbox subscriptions.

![A screenshot of the available features for Subscriptions on an Xbox Series X](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-2651.jpg)

 With a subscription selected, you can manage your Xbox subscription using any of the following settings and processes:

* **Change plan** allows you to view and switch from one subscription tier to another, like going from Xbox Game Pass For Console to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
* **Turn off recurring billing** or**Turn on recurring billing** will cancel or activate monthly payments.
* **See billing history** allows you to access past bills for your subscription.
* **Change how you pay** will enable you to switch your payment method to another linked to your Xbox.
* **Cancel subscription** allows you to end a monthly subscription.

 While these features cover the most common ways you can manage your Xbox subscriptions, some of the features require the Microsoft Edge app on your Xbox.

## How to Use Microsoft Edge to Manage Subscriptions on Xbox

 Almost every feature that can manage subscriptions from your Xbox, can be altered from the**Subscriptions** page. However, if you want to**Change plan** or**Turn on recurring billing** , your Xbox will redirect you to the Microsoft Edge app and expect you to manage the subscription from there.

 If this is the case, there are a few extra steps involved before you can manage or alter your Xbox subscription:

* After selecting**Change plan** or**Turn on recurring billing** , select**Continue** to be redirected to Microsoft Edge.
* From here, you may need to sign into your Microsoft account. If so, sign into the same account as the Xbox profile linked to your subscription.
* If you selected**Turn on recurring billing** , once Microsoft Edge loads, select**Buy now** to enable recurring billing and reactivate your subscription.
* If you chose**Change plan** , you will be placed on the**All subscriptions** page for your Microsoft account on Microsoft Edge. From here, select**Subscribe** or**Resubscribe** to switch to a different plan.

 Switching plans can often be based on your knowledge of how one subscription tier compares to another. For instance,[Comparing Xbox Game Pass to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate](https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-game-pass-vs-game-pass-ultimate-upgrading/) weighs whether an increased games library is worth a monthly price increase.

 But with accessible ways of switching and activating subscriptions straight from your Xbox, you at least don't have to worry about hitting any roadblocks when managing subscriptions from your Series X|S.
