## Configuring CrossOver for Counter-Strike 2

 Before launching Counter-Strike 2, it's essential to adjust settings in CrossOver to enhance performance and stability. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Close the Steam window, and open CrossOver again.
2. Select the**Steam** bottle and toggle on**D3DMetal** on the right. This will enable[hardware acceleration via DirectX](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-directx-why-important-for-gaming/) and translate all API calls to Metal.  
![CrossOver Steam bottle configuration settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/steam-bottle-configuration-settings-crossover.jpg)
3. Reopen Steam, go to**Library** , Control-click on Counter-Strike 2, and navigate to**Properties > General** .
4. Type in the following command under the**Launch Options** field:  
`-nojoy -+cl_forcepreload 1 -novid`  
![Counter-Strike 2 Launch Options page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/counter-strike-2-launch-options.jpg)
5. Finally, click the**Play** button to start the game. Note that during the first launch, it may take a couple of minutes for the game to start up.
