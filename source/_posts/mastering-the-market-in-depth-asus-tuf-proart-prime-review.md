### What's the Difference Between Asus ROG and Asus TUF?

 While ROG and TUF are two of Asus' leading gaming brands, there are significant differences. For example, ROG consistently integrates the latest, cutting-edge CPU and GPU options as soon as they are released. ROG laptops were some of the first to utilize Nvidia's GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs, giving ROG an edge in performance and future-proofing over TUF, which often uses prior generation or more mainstream components to hit lower price points.

 The story is similar for displays. ROG gaming laptops push the boundaries with features like 300Hz+ refresh rates, 1440p or 4K resolutions, and mini-LED backlighting for enhanced contrast. TUF screens still offer solid gaming performance with refresh rates around 144Hz and 1080p resolution but stop short of the bleeding-edge technology ROG debuts.

 For some, TUF represents a sweet spot that balances capability and cost. But for buyers wanting an uncompromising top-tier experience, ROG's cutting-edge parts and screens deliver system performance a notch above the rest.
