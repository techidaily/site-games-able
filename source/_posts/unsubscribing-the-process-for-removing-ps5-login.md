## Unsubscribing: The Process for Removing PS5 Login

 Having multiple users on a single PS5 can be a great way to share games, separate saved game files, access stores in different regions, and create a personalized corner for PS5 video gamers who share the same physical space.

 However, all things must come to an end, and it has reached the time a user is no longer needed, or you simply do not wish to share games with another user again. We’ve made this guide to direct you on how to do that and answer some other important questions that you might have regarding this topic.

## How to Delete User Accounts on a PS5

 You might be tempted to retrace the path you took to[add a new user to your PS5](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-a-new-ps5-user-and-guest-account/) to delete one. But while deleting users is straightforward, it’s quite different from the steps you take to make them.

 Deleting a user is a permanent and irrevocable process, and the deleted user may lose all the progress they’ve made in their games while also losing all video clips and screenshots they took with that account. It’s best to[back up that user’s PS5 data first](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-back-up-data-ps5/) .

 If you’re sure this is what you want to do, we’ve detailed all the steps you should follow below:

1. From your PS5’s home screen, navigate to**Settings** (represented by the cog wheel in the top-right corner).
2. Select**User and Accounts** in the Settings menu.
3. Choose**Delete Users** , and you’ll see all the users on the PS5 on the right panel.

4. Select the user you wish to delete and choose**Yes** when the prompt appears.

5. If you have any games running, your PS5 will prompt you to close them; select**Yes** .

 A small message will flash on the screen saying that it's deleting the user, and after that, the user’s account is gone forever.

 Deleting a user on a PS5 is quite different from deleting a PSN account. Deleting a PSN account will mean forever losing access to all games the owner purchased on that account. You can’t delete a PSN account on a PS5, you’ll need to contact Sony.

## Is There a Primary Account on a PS5?

 PS5s don’t have primary accounts. You can delete any account from any other account as long as it’s not password protected. Likewise, any user that buys a game can share it with all other users logged on to the same PS5 through PS5’s game-sharing features.

 If you would like to simply stop sharing games instead of deleting an account, you can navigate to **Settings > Users and Accounts > Other > Console > Disable** .

No one will be able to access your games again.

## Be Careful of Deleting Precious PS5 User Data

 We’ve already stated here that you should back up all your data before deleting a user account to avoid data loss. And that’s because it could be really painful to log into a PS5 you’re using only to realize that another user has deleted everything you’ve worked hard to do on it. Prevent this by using all the backup methods you have access to.
