### Q: What's the difference between a gaming keyboard and a regular keyboard?

 The most prominent differences between gaming keyboards and regular keyboards are that gaming keyboards are sturdier, generally provide better tactile feedback, cause less typing strain, and often include extra features like macro keys tailored for gamers. They aren't required, but gaming keyboards make video games significantly better.

### Q: What is a mechanical keyboard, and why is it better for gaming?

 Mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches for each key rather than relying on a cheaper membrane switch. Mechanical keyboards are considered better for gaming because their key presses are highly predictable and provide excellent tactile feedback. Many provide additional features like N-Key Rollover, which is ideal for games that require complex key combos.

### Q: Which mechanical switches are best for gaming?

 Some of the best mechanical switches for gaming include red switches, which provide little-to-no resistance; brown switches, which provide light tactile feedback; and blue switches, which provide medium tactile feedback. Some of the other[popular mechanical keyboard switch types](https://www.makeuseof.com/most-popular-mechanical-keyboard-switches-how-they-impact-gaming/) include black switches, lekker switches, and speed silvers.

### Q: What does TKL mean?

 TKL stands for TenKeyLess—and simply put, TKL refers to keyboards that don't have the ten-key numpad. TKL keyboards are excellent for gaming because many keyboards that omit the numpad are either compact (making them an ideal fit for small gaming setups) or replace the numpad with something more useful, like programmable keys.
