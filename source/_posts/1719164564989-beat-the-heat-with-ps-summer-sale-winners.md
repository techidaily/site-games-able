## Beat the Heat with PS Summer Sale Winners

 Life can get busy, and there aren't a lot of hours left in the day to delve into your favorite video games. So what better time to pick up a new gaming obsession than during the summer holidays? That’s what Sony thought, too, and it's throwing a massive sale to make it even easier for you to sink your teeth into some amazing games this holiday.

 There are quite literally thousands of games on sale, so if you don’t have the time or patience to sift through them all to find the best deals, we’ve done the hard work for you.

## 1\. Overcooked! 2

 The best part of the summer holidays is that your friends are most likely on holiday as well, which means that there is no excuse not to invite them over and have a night of ridiculous fun playing Overcooked! 2\. Overcooked! 2 is a chaotic party game where you have to work together to serve food to some very impatient customers under extreme conditions in a short time limit. If you like laughing, you'll like this.

**Download** :[Overcooked 2](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4064-CUSA10940%5F00-OVERCOOKED200000) for $7.49 (70% off)

## 2\. My Time at Portia Deluxe Edition

 If you’re a fan of cozy games, My Time at Portia would be a brilliant game to play next. My Time at Portia is a wholesome life-sim adventure where you can engage in all your favorite Harvest-Moon-esque activities, like mining, crafting, farming, exploring, and taming some of the adorable critters that live in Portia. With the Deluxe Edition, you can enjoy The Housewarming Bundle, which gifts you cosmetic items, in-game currency, and consumables to help kickstart your gaming adventure.

**Download** :[My Time at Portia Deluxe Edition](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4064-CUSA10924%5F00-0866856090541143) for $7.99 (75% off)

## 3\. Deathloop

 Deathloop is 75% off, which is a massive saving for a Game of the Year nominee. If you like first-person shooters and the movie Groundhog Day, you will most likely love Deathloop. You may be thinking that that’s a strange combination of things, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But Deathloop is an action-packed adventure that is puzzling, hilarious, and well worth $14.99.

**Download** :[Deathloop](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA01302%5F00-DEATHLOOP0000000) for $14.99 (75% off)

## 4\. Little Nightmares 1 & 2

 Walking the line between absolutely horrifying and terribly cute is not easy, but if any game series does it perfectly, it's Little Nightmares. Both Little Nightmares 1 and 2 share adorable protagonists and horrific enemies that will definitely haunt your dreams for at least a couple of nights, possibly more. Consider yourself warned.

**Download** :[Little Nightmares 1 & 2](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-PPSA02200%5F00-LN1LN2BUNDLE0000) for $14.99 (70% off)

## 5\. Owlboy

 Owlboy is a whimsical platforming adventure with a beautiful pixel art style and story to match. While there are plenty of [differences between AAA and indie games](https://www.makeuseof.com/aaa-games-vs-indie-games-differences/) , indie’s have more than enough potential to be just as good, if not better, than AAA titles. Owlboy is a perfect example of that. And it’s on sale for roughly the price of a deli sandwich. While deli sandwiches are unarguably good, forgoing one for lunch is definitely worth experiencing the breathtaking adventure of Owlboy.

**Download** :[Owlboy](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4218-CUSA09914%5F00-OWLBOY0000000000) for $9.99 (60% off)

## 6\. Unravel Two

 Unravel Two is a beautifully rendered puzzle platformer that can be enjoyed alone, but it is best experienced with a friend. It has some incredibly unique and satisfying mechanics where you can use the yarn that makes up your body to interact with your surroundings and solve puzzles. It is very similar to It Takes Two, so if you were a fan of that, this should be at the top of your backlog.

**Download** :[Unravel Two](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483%5F00-COLDWOODPIKE0000) for $4.99 (75% off)

## 7\. The Last of Us: Part II

 Even if you’re not a gamer, the chances are you know about The Last of Us. But Joel and Ellie’s story didn't just end when the hit TV series did. That is only one part of their adventure, so if you want a sneak peek into the events that you can expect from the second series, you can get it for half price in PlayStation’s summer sale. If you’ve been looking for [games to play if you like the Last of Us TV show](https://www.makeuseof.com/games-to-play-if-you-like-the-last-of-us-tv-show/) , this should be your first stop for obvious reasons.
