## Gameplay Tech Talk: Arcade Vs. Console for Fighters

 The fighting game community is one of the oldest competitive video game scenes. It began with meetups in local arcades and has since become much more accessible to players.

 While the platform has changed, the drive for competition remains the same, and players are always looking for an edge. So, which of the two most common inputs in the Fighting Game Community (FGC) is better: controller or arcade stick?

## Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Factors to Consider

 Most fighting games were first ported to consoles before becoming available on PCs. The controllers that come with these consoles have changed significantly over the years, but the original design concept remains the same.

 Controllers try to capture the magic of the arcade in a smaller form factor. Some of the best controllers currently on the market, like the Xbox Series X|S controller and the PS5's DualSense controller, go above and beyond.

 While these serve their intended purpose, portable arcade sticks are now readily available to fighting game enthusiasts. Both options have their merits, and here are a few factors to consider when deciding which is best for fighting games.

### 1\. Input Precision

 It’s time to take a closer look at what is required to be competitive in a fighting game. There’s a reason the FGC is thriving after over 30 years of competition.

 Every input matters when facing the best, creating a large skill ceiling for new players to explore. The sky is the limit, provided that your precision and speed of execution are on point. With this in mind, your controller of choice needs to support input precision.

 First, let’s consider the controller. Controllers have varying buttons that can be assigned to different actions in-game. However, movement is usually restricted to two options. You could either use a joystick or a D-Pad. As freeing as both options can be, they do have their problems.

 The joystick is pretty small and can be imprecise when used by a novice.[Joysticks are also prone to stick drift](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-joystick-drift/) after prolonged use, which could cause your character to move unprompted. On the other hand, the D-Pad is a bit more precise but harder to use with a limited range of motion.

 An arcade stick trumps a controller in terms of input precision. The stick is fairly large and combines the freedom of movement a joystick offers with the precision of a D-Pad. Most arcade sticks come with eight input buttons, which is typically sufficient for most games. However, players are forced to use button combinations for other in-game actions.

 So, while an arcade stick is precise, it requires more skill than a controller.

### 2\. Durability

 Fighting games are input intense and push whatever controller is used to its limit. As such, it is important to consider the durability of your input of choice before purchasing one. So, let’s look at the build quality of most controllers.

 There are two sides to this argument. Some users praise newer controllers for their ingenuity and solid build, while others feel they aren’t as good as they used to be.

 The fact is, controllers degrade a lot quicker than before. However, this can also be attributed to the rise in competitive gaming. While we aren’t privy to the manufacturing processes of most mainstream controllers, we can see the process behind creating an arcade stick.

 A few YouTube channels cover arcade stick customization, which displays how solid the build quality is. Ultimately, arcade sticks are specifically designed to take a lot of abuse and last a long time.

 A high-quality arcade stick can last five to six years without maintenance and even longer when maintained periodically. Controllers, however, need to be changed more frequently and are costly to fix when damaged.

### 3\. Functional Buttons

![A yellow arcade stick with blue input buttons](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arcade-stick.jpg)

 Input specifications are as unique as each fighting game. As such, it is important to research what your game of choice requires to get the best user experience.

 Controllers typically have a lot more functional buttons than arcade sticks. They come with face and shoulder buttons which most modern fighting games incorporate into their control schemes.

 However,[a reason some gamers swear by arcade sticks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/why-gamers-swear-arcade-sticks/) is their customizability. You can take your arcade stick apart, change the layout and add whatever buttons you feel are necessary to compete in your game of choice.

 One downside of this approach is the technical knowledge required to customize an arcade stick. Ultimately, a controller might be the better choice depending on how many functional buttons a fighting game requires.

![A vibrating PS5 controller](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/untitled-design-3.jpg)

 Feedback in console games has been a big thing since the release of early dual-shock controllers. Most modern fighting game titles allow for varying degrees of feedback. It can be as small as a little vibration when your player gets hit.

 However, not every professional player likes the distraction some of these vibrations could cause, so it isn’t often a factor to consider when choosing between arcade sticks and controllers. Regardless, it still boils down to choice.

 A controller is the best option if you are the type of player that likes feedback when playing your fighting games. Arcade sticks do not come with vibrational feedback in any form.

 However, some enthusiasts are playing around with the idea of introducing haptic feedback to arcade sticks. It is also worth noting that the DualSense controller, in particular, supports haptic feedback, which can[make your fighting games a bit more immersive](https://www.makeuseof.com/force-haptic-feedback-games/) .

### 5\. Ergonomics

![A father and his son playing video games on a couch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ergonomics.jpg)

 Ergonomics as a concept has become increasingly important with the emergence of the competitive gaming scene. Assessing the best ways to optimize your environment for prolonged sitting is important, especially when you spend long hours playing your fighting game of choice.

 Your controller of choice can contribute to the ergonomics of your setup, as surprising as that may sound. Here’s what I mean.

 A controller allows for a more relaxed posture, as gamers can move their controllers as they please. Modern controllers are also designed to fit in many grip styles for prolonged periods. Also, a controller allows you to be further away from the screen and sit on as comfortable of a chair as you own.

 An arcade stick, on the other hand, is large and clunky. One could rest the box on their lap or place it on a table. The first option promotes hunching over during gaming sessions and can be bad for your back.

 You can limit the damage by placing your arcade stick on an adjustable table. An adjustable table allows you to experiment with different heights until you find the one that allows you to sit straight while using your arcade stick.

 However, this is a lot of trouble just to game comfortably. Consequently, there’s no denying that a controller is better ergonomically than an arcade stick.

### 6\. Compatibility

 This is the ultimate factor when choosing between a controller and an arcade stick. Now, most fighting games are available both on console and PC. However, does your device support a controller or a fighting stick? Or does it support both? Also, how easily can you hook up your controller or fight stick to your device?

 Well, both consoles and PCs support controllers to varying degrees. Controllers work well with their matching console and also on PC. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S controllers are plug-and-play compatible with Windows.

 Most fighting games operate on Steam, which has facilities that support traditional controllers and arcade sticks. So, you shouldn’t have a problem with either option if you run your game on Steam.

 On the other hand, consoles are very picky about the arcade sticks permitted to run on the platform. As such, you'll need to research and discover what arcade sticks your console supports.

 Long story short, compatibility is a limiting factor affecting console players more than their PC Counterparts. Both inputs work seamlessly on PC, while only a small selection of both work on consoles.

## Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Which Is the Better Option?

 After going over a few criteria integral to deciding what input you should choose, let's come to a vrerdict. Well, if you intend to reach the peak of competitive fighting games, you will need an arcade stick. The precision and functionality are incomparable.

 However, some top players in the fighting game scene use controllers. Albeit possible, it takes much more effort to be good on a controller consistently. If you have the extra time to put in, then it won’t be a problem. Otherwise, an arcade stick is the way to go.

## Get the Best Competitive Advantage

 The ultimate goal of any competitive fighting game player is to be the best. As a result, fighting games have spawned a passionate community of gamers dedicated to honing their skills.

 But to be the best, you need the best gear. It all boils down to what feels right. Do you prefer an arcade stick’s control or a controller’s comfort and convenience? Either way, you will have an amazing time playing the fighting games you love.
