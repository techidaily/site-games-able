### Key Takeaways

* Start live streaming on Twitch from your Android phone by opening the app's Creator Mode, selecting**Create > Stream IRL** , customizing the stream's details for optimum viewer engagement, and tapping Stream.
* On iOS, once in Creator Mode, tap**Create > Stream IRL** , personalize the stream information, and hit Stream to go live.
* While Twitch mobile streaming is easy, limitations include a small chat window, it automatically ends if the phone screen locks, and the inability to capture the screen and camera simultaneously.

 You don't need to use your laptop or desktop computer to go live on Twitch. Twitch's mobile apps on Android and iOS have the functionality baked in, allowing you to live stream from your phone—and this is how it works.

## How to Live Stream on Twitch on an Android Device

On Android, use the following steps to go live on Twitch.

1. Open Twitch and tap**Create** in the top right to switch to**Creator Mode** . If you see**Watch** instead of**Create** , go to the next step.
2. Tap the**Create** button in the bottom center and select**Stream IRL** .
3. Grant Twitch permissions to access your Camera and Microphone. Once finished, Twitch will display a camera preview of the stream.
4. Tap the**Edit** button (Pencil icon) to customize your stream's information. The important fields you should customize include Title, Category, Go Live Notification, and tags. Tap**Save** in the top right to save your changes.
5. To go live, tap the**Stream** button (a circular button with a purple ring at the bottom left) to start your stream.

Close

 When your stream is up and running, you'll see the duration, current number of viewers, and total followers at the top. If you're not impressed with your follower count, we have [tips for building a bigger viewership on Twitch](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/twitch-tips-build-viewership/) .

 Once you finish streaming, tap the same**Stream** button at the bottom left and confirm by selecting**End Stream** from the pop-up. Whether you're streaming from your smartphone or PC, remember to avoid the [things that could get you banned from Twitch](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-get-you-banned-from-twitch/) .

## How to Live Stream on Twitch via iOS

 If you have an iPhone, you can go live on Twitch by following these steps.

1. Open Twitch on your device.
2. Tap**Create** in the top right to switch to**Creator Mode** . If you see**Watch** in the top right instead of**Watch** , you don't have to do anything—you're already in Creator Mode.
3. Tap the**Create** button (purple button with the plus (**+**) symbol in the center) and select**Stream IRL** .
4. Next, grant Twitch permission to access your Microphone and Camera. Do this by tapping**Enable Microphone/ Camera** and selecting**Allow** from the pop-up. Twitch will then display a preview of your camera on the next page.
5. [Before going live](https://www.makeuseof.com/things-to-do-before-going-live/) , customize the stream's information. Tap the**Edit** button (Pencil icon) and customize the stream's information accordingly.
6. Tap**Done** to save your changes. Finally, hit the**Stream** button to start your stream.

Close

 You'll see a red**Live** button at the top, indicating that your stream is live. To end the stream, tap the red**Stop** button at the bottom left and confirm by tapping**End Stream** in the pop-up.

## Limitations of Live Streaming on Twitch via Mobile

 Streaming on Twitch via mobile is convenient, but it has several limitations you should be aware of.

* If you're streaming your screen, everything you see is also visible to your viewers.
* Because of the limited screen space, you get a small window for viewing chats, which won't be optimal if you receive many messages from your viewers.
* The stream will automatically end if your screen is locked. Therefore, ensure your phone's screen doesn't lock to avoid the stream being cut short. You should also avoid using headphones or any Bluetooth-powered speakers, as they won't provide the best audio experience. According to Twitch, don't use headphones if you need to capture all the sounds.
* Unlike on PC, you can't simultaneously capture your screen and camera. You'll have to pick one.

 Streaming on Twitch via mobile is quite straightforward compared to streaming on your laptop or desktop. But this convenience comes with its downsides. You should note the limitations and see if you can tolerate them. Otherwise, you're better off using a laptop or desktop to go live on Twitch.
