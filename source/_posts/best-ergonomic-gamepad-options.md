## Choosing the Best Mousepad for Gaming

 Choosing the right kind of gaming mouse pad will depend on what type of gamer you are. Do you play professionally or just competitively? Do you favor optical or laser mice? Do you want customizable RGB lighting that syncs with your gameplay, or are you all about smooth tracking and pinpoint accuracy?

 Whatever kind of gamer you are, there's plenty to choose from to accommodate your specific requirements.

 For a premium mouse pad experience, we recommend the Razer Atlas Tempered Glass Mouse Pad. Eschewing all the RGB trimmings, it focuses instead on performance, with an ultra-smooth surface that accommodates precision gameplay and pinpoint accuracy.

 If you're after a more budget-priced alternative, you can't go wrong with the SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad. For under $10, you have a reliably smooth gaming mouse pad that can easily be wrapped up and taken anywhere.

 However, provided that you favor optical mice, the Razer Firefly V2 is a great overall option. Optimized for super smooth tracking, thanks to its micro-textured surface, it allows you to move deftly and with improved accuracy. It has a built-in cable catch to prevent any annoying snagging and is armed with Razer Chroma RGB lighting, which can be synced to mirror your gameplay.
