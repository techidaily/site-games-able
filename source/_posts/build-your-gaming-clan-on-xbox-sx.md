## Build Your Gaming Clan on Xbox S/X

 Everyone has their own interests and hobbies. It’s part of what makes people unique. But when your hobby is gaming, and the people you know in real-life don’t share the same interests as you, it can be difficult to find enough people to fill up your lobby. Especially if you prefer to play with people you know.

 Flitting through random online lobbies can be fruitful, but finding a group of like-minded individuals by chance can be rare. If you want a place to find new friends on your Xbox Series X|S or you want a place to hang out with the friends you already have, you can make a Club.

## What Is a Club on the Xbox Series X|S?

 Clubs on the Xbox Series X|S are digital meeting places where you can go to socialize with your friends or even make new ones.

 Not everyone loves gaming as much as you might. It isn’t uncommon for gamers to not have any friends in real life who play video games, but that doesn’t mean you can never play COD with a solid crew of like-minded people. It just means you might have to look a little harder to find them.

 If you want to[find online players for your Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-online-players-on-xbox-series-xs/) , Clubs are a great place to look.

6. Now comes the hardest part—thinking of a name for your club. If you’re creating the club to find players to play a certain game, giving it a name that resonates with that game is a good start.
7. Select**Create club** once you’ve made your choices.
8. From there, you can customize your club by giving it a background and profile image, choosing a color scheme, and making tags to help others find and join your exclusive club.

9. Press**Done** to complete your club.

 And just like that, you have created your Club. You just have to sit back and wait for the tags to do their work before you can start playing the[best co-op games on the Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-couch-co-op-games-for-xbox-series-x-s/) with your new friends.

 Provided it’s not hidden, of course. If it is, you will have to press**Invite someone** on the Club home page and send your invites out to your lucky recipients manually.

## Share Your Love of Gaming With Others

 Clubs are a brilliant way to expand your gaming circle. Some games like Among Us, for example, are much more fun when playing with a lobby full of friends.

 If your real-life friends don’t share your love for gaming, or they don’t play often anymore, you don’t have to put the controller down and retire your Xbox for good. Simply create a Club and make a group of new friends to play with.
