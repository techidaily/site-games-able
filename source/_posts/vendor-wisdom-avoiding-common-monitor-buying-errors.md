### Key Takeaways

* You can only determine the optimal monitor specifications and features you'll need after you've defined what you need and want.
* Understand that bigger and more expensive monitors aren't always better.
* Future-proofing is important. Consider the features you'll need in the future, and never assume you won't need a warranty.

 With so many options available, finding a monitor that fits your needs and satisfies your wants is harder than ever. Once you figure out what you need, make sure to avoid the common issues that affect everyone buying a new monitor.

## 1 Not Considering Your Needs

 One of the biggest mistakes shoppers make is not considering their specific needs before purchasing a monitor. Are you a gamer who needs a high refresh rate for smooth gameplay? A graphic designer who requires accurate color reproduction? A programmer who needs an ultrawide monitor? Or maybe you are a person who does a little bit of everything and is looking for a more general-purpose monitor.

 Spending some time thinking of what you'll primarily use the monitor for will guide you toward the right features and specifications your monitor should have.

## 2 Getting the Wrong-Sized Monitor for Your Room

 Size matters when it comes to monitors, but bigger isn't always better. Before settling on a screen size, consider the dimensions of your room or workspace. Different screen sizes will require different spacing between you and the monitor.

 The bigger the monitor, the farther you'll need to sit to view the entire screen comfortably. In contrast, the smaller the screen size, the nearer you'll have to be so as not to strain your eyes. It's easier to get a properly sized monitor for your room than to find a room that fits your monitor.

 Take measurements and ensure the monitor fits comfortably in your environment.

## 3 Forgetting About Ports

 Ports are often overlooked but are essential for connectivity. Consider what devices you'll connect to your monitor and ensure it has the necessary ports. Having the wrong ports on your monitor can cause performance issuesâ€”or worse, it won't even work for your system.

 For example, using[HDMI over DisplayPort for gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/hdmi-vs-display-port-best-for-gaming/) on an Nvidia gaming system because your monitor doesn't have DisplayPort can lower gaming performance due to the lack of G-Sync support.

 You may also want to think about future-proofing your setup by choosing a monitor with versatile ports that can accommodate system upgrades you plan to have in the future.

## 4 Choosing the Wrong Screen Resolution

 While a larger screen can provide a more immersive experience, the resolution determines the clarity of the display. Don't assume that a bigger screen automatically means a higher resolution. Consider the resolution that best suits your usage and ensures sharp image quality.

 Of course, you don't always have to have high resolutions for larger monitors. For example, programmers likely won't have a problem using a 1080p ultrawide monitor so long as they can program and read the documentation.

## 5 Focusing Solely on Price

 While budget constraints are understandable, focusing solely on price can lead to overlooking crucial features and sacrificing quality. Keep in mind that a cheaper monitor may cost you more in the long run if it lacks the features you need or has poor build quality.

 Sometimes, a less expensive monitor might be a better fit for you. Sometimes, you don't need all the extra features that more expensive monitors have. In fact, some features may be something you'll want to avoid. For example, a cheaper QLED panel is better than a more expensive OLED in a place with lots of natural lighting.

 Strike a balance between price and value to ensure you get the best bang for your buck.

## 6 Failing to Understand Common Monitor Specifications

[Understanding common monitor specifications](https://www.makeuseof.com/commonly-confused-monitor-specs/) such as refresh rate, response time, and brightness is crucial for making an informed decision. These factors can significantly impact your viewing experience, especially if you're a gamer or professional requiring precise color accuracy. Take the time to research and understand what each specification means for your usage.

## 7 Falling for Marketing Gimmicks

 Don't be swayed by flashy marketing gimmicks that add little to no value to your overall experience. Integrated speakers, RGB lighting, or fancy labels may seem enticing, but they often come at the expense of essential features or performance. Focus on functionality over aesthetics to ensure you get a monitor that meets your needs.

 It's not bad to have fancy lighting on your monitor, especially if you really like it. As long as you've set your budget and prioritized your needs first, getting the extras shouldn't be a problem afterward.

## 8 Ignoring Ergonomic Features

 Ergonomic features play a significant role in ensuring comfort during extended use. Look for monitors with adjustable stands, tilt, swivel, and height options to customize your viewing experience.

 Additionally, even if you're currently fine with the stock monitor stand, consider whether it supports[VESA mounting and what VESA standard](https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-vesa-mounting-standards/#:~:text=One%20such%20standard%20is%20the,fit%20across%20different%20display%20mounts.) it uses. Having the option to VESA mount your monitor will ensure more flexible setups that may interest you in the future.

## 9 Not Checking Reviews and User Feedback

 Before purchasing, read reviews and user feedback to get a sense of real-world experiences. Pay attention to both positive and negative reviews to gauge the monitor's strengths and weaknesses. This will help you make a more informed decision and avoid potential pitfalls.

## 10 Not Checking for Warranty and Support

 Finally, don't overlook the importance of warranty and support when purchasing a monitor. Even the most reputable brands can encounter issues, so having reliable warranty coverage and access to timely support can save you from headaches down the line. Prioritize monitors with robust warranty options and reputable customer service.

 When possible, you'll want to have both a manufacturer's warranty and a store warranty. If you can only have a warranty from the manufacturer, make sure that the store you buy your monitor from is an official distributor of that manufacturer.

 Additionally, buying a monitor from a physical store near you may actually be better than buying a slightly discounted one online. Often, visiting a physical store to return or service your monitor is less of a hassle than shipping your monitor to an online store, which may take significantly longer to process.

 By avoiding these common mistakes and taking the time to research and evaluate your options, you can ensure that you end up with a monitor that meets your needs and provides an enjoyable viewing experience for years to come.
