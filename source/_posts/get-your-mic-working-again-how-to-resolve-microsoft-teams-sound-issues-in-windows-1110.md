### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 The Microsoft Teams mic not working issue may indicate problems with your audio driver. To ensure the microphone work smoothly when you’re on an online class or meeting, you should always keep the audio driver up–to-date. Here are two ways for you to update the audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To update the driver manually, you can visit the PC or the headset manufacturer’s website and search for the most recent driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit).

 Once you’ve downloaded the right driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the drivers for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1-3.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-2-5.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Regular driver updates can make your audio device run in the tip-top condition, but if this doesn’t fix Microsoft Teams microphone not working, there is the last method to try.

### Fix 5 – Reinstall Microsoft Teams

 If none of the solutions above get your microphone back to working, the cause might be on the software’s end. Download and reinstall the latest Microsoft Teams to resolve the errors during the previous installation.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run command. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-1-2.jpg)
2. Right-click**Microsoft Teams** and click**Uninstall** .
