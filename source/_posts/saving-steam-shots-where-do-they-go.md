## Saving Steam Shots: Where Do They Go?

 Steam offers a vast catalog of games and a social network built into one robust platform. If you enjoy taking screenshots of funny or interesting moments in games you've played, you'll want to know where those screenshots are to look back on or share with others.

Steam screenshots are easy to find if you know where to look.

## Steam Screenshots Are Saved Locally and Online

[Capturing and managing Steam screenshots](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-capture-and-manage-steam-screenshots/) is a fairly straightforward process, but sometimes things can go wrong. However, when you take a screenshot on Steam, it will save both locally and online. This means that if you have an issue with your PC's storage device, you'll have a spare copy online and vice versa.

 To see your Steam screenshots in their online location, do the following:

* Open the Steam desktop app and ensure you are logged in.
* On the top menu, click**View > Screenshots** .
* Your most recent previously-saved images will appear in the pop-up window.
* Click**View Online Library** to see your**Profile Screenshots** , which will comprise all the screenshots you've manually uploaded.
* Click**Show on Disk** to find where your screenshots are saved on your computer, so that you have a backup copy.

To find your Steam screenshots on the mobile app, you would need to:

* Open the app and ensure you're logged in.
* Tap your Steam profile icon in the top-right corner.
* Tap**Screenshots/Videos** .

Close

 You'll be able to look at and save all of your screenshots to your phone. Keep in mind that you wouldn't be able to access any Steam screenshots you didn't upload to your profile until you're back on the PC where they were originally saved.

## Screenshots Are a Great Way to Reminisce on Gaming Experiences

 There are so many moments in games that could mean something to you. From a particular area of a map offering stunning visuals, to funny moments you had on a multiplayer game with friends, to huge cities you created yourself in a sandbox that you want to share online.

 Steam screenshots help you to capture and share all of this. Luckily, they're easy to find.
