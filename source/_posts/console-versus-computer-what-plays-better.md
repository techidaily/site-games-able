## Console Versus Computer: What Plays Better?

 Xbox vs. PC is a discussion that sparks every time a new generation Xbox comes to the light. With the Xbox Series X leading this generation of Microsoft's gaming consoles, it is yet again something to think about.

 This is especially true considering that you may not be able to get your hands on one easily. If you are reading this later, you may not have a problem with that.

 Here, we shall compare the Xbox Series X to a gaming PC based on important factors to help you make the ultimate decision of which one to get.

## Things to Keep in Mind When Comparing Xbox to PC

 While this article aims to provide you with essential pointers, you will have to keep a few things in mind:

* The pricing for Xbox Series X console and PC components can vary with time and country.
* The availability of the console and graphics card for a gaming PC is another deciding factor.

 Now, with that in mind, let us walk through some important points comparing the Xbox Series X and a gaming PC.

## Xbox Series X vs. Gaming PC: Which Is Better?

 Both the Xbox and a gaming PC have a lot to offer, but which one comes out on top when comparing the two? Let's look at the key factors you should consider when deciding whether to buy an Xbox or a gaming PC.

### The Xbox and PC Game Ecosystem

 It is not just the hardware that you interact with, you should also consider the availability of games and the pricing of titles.

 While[Xbox Game Pass](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-xbox-game-pass-everything-need-know/) offers considerable value for both PC and console, the base subscription for PC includes an extra[EA Play](https://www.ea.com/ea-play) subscription. To access EA titles on your Xbox console, you will have to opt for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

 Xbox Game Pass offers plenty of games and discounts on both platforms. So, if you rely on Xbox Game Pass alone, both offers are of a similar value, with a slight edge to PC subscribers.

 However, you are restricted to the Microsoft store or the shelves of your local game shop when purchasing games for the Xbox Series X.

 With a gaming PC, you can access a variety of other game stores, like Steam and Epic Games, that feature massive collections of games with regular deals and even free games. Furthermore, there are endless possibilities for new subscriptions and services in the near future, considering you do not rely on a single company, unlike the Xbox Series X.

### Xbox and PC Hardware Capabilities

 The Xbox Series X is a capable console that features an 8-core Zen 2-based AMD processor with AMD's RDNA 2 architecture-powered GPU, providing 52 compute units.

 Xbox Series X specs are almost equivalent to a Ryzen 7 3700X desktop processor paired with Radeon RX 6800 or Nvidia RTX 3070\. So, the Xbox Series X graphics prowess is impressive enough for 4K gaming and 120 FPS experience on paper.

![hardware-cpu-gpu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hardware-cpu-gpu.jpg)

 Of course, the performance depends on the type of game you play. So, you should not expect a fully-fledged 4K gaming experience with 120 frames for all games.

 A gaming PC with that specification may not be enough for fully-fledged 4K gaming either, but you get the option to[utilize DLSS to give budget PCs top-end graphics](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-deep-learning-super-sampling-can-give-budget-pcs-top-end-graphics/) or[use AMD's Fidelity FX Super Resolution](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-how-to-use/) to improve the performance. But, you may be able to experience better on the console for its optimization.

 However, if you consider a high-end gaming PC, you can easily get to experience more.

### Xbox and PC Price

 Building a high-end gaming PC is certainly an expensive endeavor. If you want every component of your system to be top-notch, the sky's the limit. You can even end up purchasing a \~$700 PC cabinet just for its aesthetics.

 It is important when building a PC, however, to make sure you're not overpaying for the components.

 It takes a significant amount of research to set up a good gaming rig. You can choose to purchase a pre-built gaming system from[NZXT](https://nzxt.com) and others for convenience, but the Xbox Series X is significantly cheaper for its gaming capabilities and hassle-free one-unit purchase.

### Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Upgrade Options

 It is important to understand whether you want to upgrade your system after a few years or just purchase a new one.

![hardware-upgrade](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hardware-upgrade.jpg)

 If you consider getting a PC, you can easily upgrade it. In fact, you can select to upgrade any component separately, which is a massive advantage for longevity. For instance, if your gaming PC performance is not satisfactory after a few years, you can simply choose to upgrade the graphics card while keeping the rest intact.

 However, you get limited upgrade choices with Xbox Series X. You can only upgrade the storage space and not the chip or graphics card. So, in the case of a console, you will need to purchase a new Xbox (next-gen) to upgrade. But, a PC upgrade may save you more money over the years.

 Not to forget, if you already have a mid-range PC that runs decently well, you can get a few new upgrades (like a new graphics card) to step up your gaming experience within a budget. Ultimately, it depends on your requirements, but for the most part, you should be able to save a few bucks and breathe life into your old PC.

### Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Portability

 When it comes to portability, a gaming PC may not be as convenient as the Xbox Series X.

 Technically, you can build a mini-ITX gaming system that is similarly portable. But, it is a challenging task to do it the right way.

 When it comes to a gaming desktop, you will have to take care of the cooling and the form factor for the components you use. It could end up being a disaster if you do not know what you are doing.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Of course, if you want the ultimate portability, a high-end laptop can prove to be better than the Xbox Series X, but you may lose out on the performance with the money you spend. Furthermore, a laptop has limited options for upgrade.

 Overall, when considering a PC, you get choices for portability, but a console is already a portable machine from the get-go.

### Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Warranty and After-Sales

 With Xbox Series X, you get a limited warranty of one year for the machine. You can consider extending the warranty for up to three years, but it may not be available at all retailers.

 In the case of a PC, you get a warranty issued for every component you purchase. Most of them offer a three-year warranty period and some even offer five to 10 years of warranty. This is a massive difference in terms of assurance and longevity.

 Of course, the Xbox Series X may not fail for years (in most cases), but you have the assurance of getting parts replaced for years to come in the case of PC components.

## Which Should You Go For: An Xbox Series X or a Gaming PC?

 If you want to focus on playing games with 4K support and want the convenience of a console, the Xbox Series X should be a great choice.

 But if you want the ability to upgrade, access to more games, and a multi-purpose system, a PC should be your pick.

 Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, you will have to weigh up your priorities and pick what is more important for you.

## Enjoy Upgrading Your Gaming Experience

 There are so many gaming platforms out there, and they all have a particular niche that they fill.

 But whether you opt for the convenience of the Xbox Series X or the power and customization opportunities that a gaming PC can give you, rest assured that you will have an incredible time gaming on either of these amazing platforms.
