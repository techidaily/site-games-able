## 3\. Deathloop

 Deathloop is 75% off, which is a massive saving for a Game of the Year nominee. If you like first-person shooters and the movie Groundhog Day, you will most likely love Deathloop. You may be thinking that that’s a strange combination of things, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But Deathloop is an action-packed adventure that is puzzling, hilarious, and well worth $14.99.

## 4\. Little Nightmares 1 & 2

 Walking the line between absolutely horrifying and terribly cute is not easy, but if any game series does it perfectly, it's Little Nightmares. Both Little Nightmares 1 and 2 share adorable protagonists and horrific enemies that will definitely haunt your dreams for at least a couple of nights, possibly more. Consider yourself warned.

## 5\. Owlboy

 Owlboy is a whimsical platforming adventure with a beautiful pixel art style and story to match. While there are plenty of[differences between AAA and indie games](https://www.makeuseof.com/aaa-games-vs-indie-games-differences/) , indie’s have more than enough potential to be just as good, if not better, than AAA titles. Owlboy is a perfect example of that. And it’s on sale for roughly the price of a deli sandwich. While deli sandwiches are unarguably good, forgoing one for lunch is definitely worth experiencing the breathtaking adventure of Owlboy.

**Download** :[Owlboy](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4218-CUSA09914%5F00-OWLBOY0000000000) for $9.99 (60% off)

## 6\. Unravel Two

 Unravel Two is a beautifully rendered puzzle platformer that can be enjoyed alone, but it is best experienced with a friend. It has some incredibly unique and satisfying mechanics where you can use the yarn that makes up your body to interact with your surroundings and solve puzzles. It is very similar to It Takes Two, so if you were a fan of that, this should be at the top of your backlog.

**Download** :[Unravel Two](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483%5F00-COLDWOODPIKE0000) for $4.99 (75% off)

## 7\. The Last of Us: Part II

 Even if you’re not a gamer, the chances are you know about The Last of Us. But Joel and Ellie’s story didn't just end when the hit TV series did. That is only one part of their adventure, so if you want a sneak peek into the events that you can expect from the second series, you can get it for half price in PlayStation’s summer sale. If you’ve been looking for[games to play if you like the Last of Us TV show](https://www.makeuseof.com/games-to-play-if-you-like-the-last-of-us-tv-show/) , this should be your first stop for obvious reasons.

**Download** :[The Last of Us: Part II](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07820%5F00-THELASTOFUSPART2) for &19.99 (50% off)

## 8\. Resident Evil Village

 Resident Evil Village is the most recent entry in the long-running horror franchise and is one of the best of the bunch. If you haven’t delved into the terrifying world of Resident Evil yet, Resident Evil Village is a great place to start, and now that it's 50% off, what’s stopping you?
