## Nintendo Switch Input Expansion: Keyboards/Mice Guide (83 Chars)

 There is no doubt that a keyboard and mouse provide you with better accuracy than a controller when gaming. However, when choosing between console and PC gaming, it seems like you always have to sacrifice either precision or comfort. But what if you could have both on your Nintendo Switch?

 If you’d like to enjoy your Switch games with the accuracy of a mouse and keyboard, there are two ways you can do so. Let’s dive in.

## How Do I Connect a Mouse and Keyboard to My Nintendo Switch?

![Gaming keyboard and mouse](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gaming-keyboard-and-mouse.jpg)

 Other consoles, such as the[PS5, have keyboard and mouse support](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-keyboard-mouse-ps5/) for gaming. Unfortunately, the Nintendo Switch does not have that luxury. It is possible to connect a regular keyboard and mouse to your Nintendo Switch by plugging them into the USB port on your dock, connecting via a Bluetooth dongle, or using a USB to USB-C converter while you're in handheld mode.

 This works, but the issue is that you can only use the keyboard to input text, such as entering passwords or adding comments to screenshots before posting them on social media. You can't use this method to actually play games with your mouse and keyboard on the Nintendo Switch.

 There are, however, two other ways you can start playing games on your Nintendo Switch with a keyboard and mouse. You can do this by using a specialized adaptor or a Bluetooth receiver.

 This requires products specifically designed to play games on consoles. While a Bluetooth receiver may be the easiest way to start gaming with your keyboard and mouse, they are both relatively easy to set up.

### 1\. Connect a Keyboard and Mouse to Your Nintendo Switch With a Bluetooth Receiver

 Several products on the market will allow you to use a Bluetooth dongle to connect a wireless keyboard and mouse to your Nintendo Switch.

 These products work by providing you with a keyboard and mouse combo designed to work like a controller. The advantage of these products is that they are ready to go whenever you are, requiring very little set-up with no outside apps required.

 They can also be more compact than other keyboards since they're designed with console gaming in mind. Products like the[GameSir VX Aimswitch](https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-AimSwitch-Keyboard-Nintendo-Computer/dp/B07J4N76T9?linkCode=ll1&tag=muo-v2-1he60jo-20&linkId=c5ba44c21f0eec0119d6942a46950468&language=en%5FUS&ref%5F=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013923&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fnintendo-switch-how-to-connect-keyboard-and-mouse%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) (as pictured above) are about half the size of a regular keyboard, providing you with only the buttons you will need to use while gaming. This makes for a more compact keyboard controller.

### 2\. Connect a Keyboard and Mouse to Your Nintendo Switch Using an Adaptor

 An adaptor works slightly differently to connect a keyboard and mouse to your Nintendo Switch. Rather than simply receiving a signal like a Bluetooth receiver, an adaptor is more like a specialized hub for all of your inputs.

 Products like the[IOGEAR KeyMander 2 Adaptor](https://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-KeyMander-Controller-Crossover-GE1337P2/dp/B08541QCKJ?linkCode=ll1&tag=muo-v2-1he60jo-20&linkId=b8c536ec9e010b1d35f25652f6581b5a&language=en%5FUS&ref%5F=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2013923&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fnintendo-switch-how-to-connect-keyboard-and-mouse%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) (as pictured above) use an adaptor to connect your keyboard and mouse to your Nintendo Switch. Once you connect your keyboard and mouse to the adaptor, your Nintendo Switch will read that input as controller input, allowing you to actually use your mouse and keyboard to play games rather than just enter password information.

 The attraction to these sorts of adaptors is that they allow you to connect any keyboard and mouse you want to your system. This means that you can use products that you might already own. It also gives you the flexibility to decide whether or not you want to game wirelessly. If you do, it’s easy as[finding a great wireless mouse and keyboard](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-wireless-mouse-and-keyboard/) and plugging their receivers into the adaptor.

 These types of keyboard and mouse adaptors may require an app that you have to download to operate them. This can be more difficult to set up, but they are more advantageous in the long run and give you more control over your set-up. Once you learn how to operate the app, you are free to change button layouts and customize your inputs to suit your needs.

## Improve Your Aim With a Keyboard and Mouse on Your Nintendo Switch

 Gaming competitively requires precise aiming, especially in first-person shooters. Even with aim assist, console controllers don’t compare to the precision you get from a keyboard and mouse. Connecting a keyboard and mouse to your Nintendo Switch may require a few more steps, but it is worth it to up your game.
