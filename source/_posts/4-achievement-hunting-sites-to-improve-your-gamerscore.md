## 4 Achievement Hunting Sites to Improve Your Gamerscore

 One of the biggest pulls of sticking with or owning an Xbox console is the need to earn Gamerscore. And with Xbox Gamerscore being so intrinsically linked to gaming on the Xbox platform, obtaining Gamerscore on your Xbox can be both addictive and rewarding.

 So, whether you're looking to expand you're well-earned Gamerscore, or even if you're starting up with earning Xbox Achievements for the first time, there are a few resources you can utilize to give your Achievement hunting an edge. But how exactly can you improve your Gamerscore, and what can you use to do so? Let's find out.

## 1. TrueAchievements

 One of the most versatile ways you can boost your Gamerscore for your Xbox account is by utilizing the Achievement-hunting website TrueAchievements.

 TrueAchievements allows you to track and read numerous Achievement guides for the entire Achievement lists of selected games. And because of [how Xbox Achievements work](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/xbox-achievements-beginners-guide/) , with some hidden or impossibly difficult to unlock or understand, having access to quick and simple Achievement guides can enhance and simplify growing your Gamerscore.

 TrueAchievements also allows you to log in with your Xbox account, allowing the site to track your account's unlocked Achievements and played games. And, by logging in with your Xbox account, you can quickly jump into any of your played games to see how to unlock a specific Achievement.

 In terms of giving you the means to heighten your Xbox Gamerscore, TrueAchievements streamlines and simplifies Achievement-hunting by unifying your Xbox account with the service and providing concise and easy Achievement guides.

## 2. Xbox Achievements

 Much like TrueAchievements, the aptly named Xbox Achievements website also provides a practical tool for expanding and enhancing your Xbox Gamerscore.

 Xbox Achievements provides a similar collection of Xbox Achievement guides as TrueAchievements does, however, Xbox Achievements is more solely dedicated to highlighting Xbox Achievement guides.

![A screenshot of the Achievement guides for Payday 3 available through Xbox Achievements](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2942.jpg)

 The homepage for Xbox Achievements hones in on the latest and trending Achievements you can unlock, whereas TrueAchievements focuses on reviews and the latest trending news stories. While Xbox Achievements also feature news stories and reviews, they take secondary status to Achievements.

 Unfortunately, the trade-off is that linking your Xbox account to Xbox Achievements isn't quite as intuitive as TrueAchievements. However, by utilizing Xbox Achievements and TrueAchievements, you should be well on your way to finding a guide for any Xbox Achievement you desire to bump up your Gamerscore.

## 3. XBL Tracker

 Aside from cater-made websites that can help you increase your Xbox Gamerscore, there are also online tools that can help streamline the process of Achievement Hunting in the first place.

 XBL Tracker represents a tool that, in a matter of seconds, can gather all the necessary information regarding your Xbox Gamertag and Achievements.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 By simply typing in your Gamertag, the site will automatically gather all your played games, Achievement data, and any associated guides. XBL Tracker also allows you to [share your Xbox game captures](https://www.makeuseof.com/capture-share-screenshots-videos-xbox-series-x/) as an additional feature alongside Achievements.

 Unlike other Gamerscore supporting websites, however, XBL Tracker has a limited list of completed guides for games. You should, therefore, utilize XBL Tracker as a supportive feature for tracking and gathering information regarding a game you have played, and want to analyze the Achievements for.

## 4. YouTube

 Regardless of whether you use Gamerscore supporting sites, sometimes unlocking a specific Achievement is exacerbating. Whether through a vague Achievement prompt, in-game error, or even game difficulty, occasionally detailed help is necessary to amp up your Gamerscore.

 This is where some of the most notable Achievement hunting-based YouTubers come in. By utilizing an online video guide, you can visualize exactly what is needed to unlock a specific Achievement in a game, something that the written guides of sites like Xbox Achievements sometimes fail to do.

 And, with comprehensive YouTube channels like Maka91Productions that provide 100 percent walkthroughs of the most popular games available, you have complete reference material for any Achievement within a game, just so long as the video exists in the first place.

 But even if you find that one content creator hasn't covered the Achievements for your game, there are tons of other creators who could've. So, by using channels like [Maka91Productions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Maka91Productions/featured) , you may be able to find specific details that other forms of Gamerscore supporting sites and tools lack.
