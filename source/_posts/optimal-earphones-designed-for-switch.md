 So whether you game on the go or in the comfort of your own home, why not get an audio upgrade and pick out a great headset to enrich your gaming? These are some of the best headphones you can get for the Nintendo Switch.

 If youâ€™re after a high-quality wired headset for gaming on the go, the HyperX Cloud II is one of the very best out there. It supports 7.1 surround sound, with stereo sound on the Switch, and uses large 53-millimeter drivers to deliver rich and immersive audio.

 This headset features a detachable, passive noise-canceling microphone and is Discord and TeamSpeak certified for crystal-clear voice chat. When used with the included USB Audio Control Box, noise-canceling, automatic gain control, and echo-cancelation can be engaged to deepen the immersion.

 Memory foam padding makes them comfortable to wear, and a durable aluminum frame allows for a good degree of flexibility. Thereâ€™s no battery life to worry about here, making them a great choice for portable gaming, which is what the Switch is all about.
