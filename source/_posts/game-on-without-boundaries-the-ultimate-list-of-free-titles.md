 Do you have a kid that likes playing games on an iPhone or Android device? If so, you should consider downloading PBS KIDS Games.

## 2\. ULTRAFLOW

 Want a buttery-smooth puzzle? Then minimalist puzzle game, ULTRAFLOW, is worth checking out. While the graphics are super simple, the gameplay can prove rather challenging.

 The goal is to get the numbered ball to the larger circle within a certain number of bounces. This limited number shows on the smaller circle. Once you use the last bounce, the ball explodes if it hasn't reached its destination.

 While some stages are complex, the game lacks timers and other restrictions. So you can play at your own pace. To restart a level, just tap twice on the screen. With 99 levels, ULTRAFLOW's bound to keep you busy for a while.

## 3\. GameStart Pixel Battle

 If you need a good retro fix without[turning your Android into a retro gaming hub](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-game-emulators-for-android/) , then GameStart Pixel Battle is the ad-free mobile game you should download.

 This is an excellent choice to consider if you want old-school side-scrolling platformer fun, as GameStart Pixel Battle comes with great 16-bit graphics. Topping it off is a chiptune soundtrack packed with 80s and 90s nostalgia.

## 4\. DATA WING

 If you are looking for an adrenaline rush, give DATA WING and its futuristic yet retro graphics a try. While it might miss the chiptunes you grew up with; the original EDM soundtrack is still pretty pleasant.

 The goal is to race to the finish line in various objective-based missions assigned by the "Mother" computer system. What sets DATA WING apart from other racers is the unique driving system. Your ship flies automatically, and you tap left or right to steer towards either direction.

 To apply brakes, simply tap both sides at the same time. You can also thrust off walls, using the momentum to your advantage to pass other racers.

 Though DATA WING is about racing, it does have a story spanning two hours with 40 levels to complete. Ultimately, this is a fun, story-driven, competitive racing game that gets your blood pumping.

**Download:** DATA WING for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DanVogt.DATAWING) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1206723870) (Free)

## 5\. OHM - A Virtual Science Centre

![OHM---A Virtual Science Centre for mobile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ohm.png)

 If you're seeking an educational game for kids or just want to learn something new yourself, OHM - A Virtual Science Centre is a good option.

 OHM features a gorgeous, low-poly design, making it one of the best-looking mobile games around. The graphics are beautiful and pull you into the fascinating world of energy and electricity.

 In OHM, you'll learn about energy and how it works. It explains how energy becomes electricity from an atomic level, working its way up to more significant objects, like transportation. The game comprises several puzzle-based chapters featuring different topics that it explains in a fun and interactive way.

 OHM's puzzles are mostly straightforward, but that's what you'd expect from a game that's supposed to serve an educational purpose. But as the learning progresses, the puzzles get trickier. It never gets too complicated, though, making the game perfect for children.

 After all, who said you couldn't have fun and learn something simultaneously? It really is among the best iPhone games without ads.

**Download:** OHM - A Virtual Science Centre for[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ohm-a-virtual-science-centre/id1183135615) (Free)

## 6\. PewPew

 Love Geometry Wars but don't feel like paying a premium? PewPew lets you experience multidirectional shoot-em-up action at no cost.

 The graphics in PewPew are basic, but it's perfect if you crave bright neon shape outlines against a black background. PewPew has a high frame rate and features five different game modes: Pandemonium, Dodge This, Assault, Chromatic Conflict, and Asteroids.

 Pandemonium includes enemies that explode or spin maniacally upon death, causing chaos for you. Dodge This challenges you to collect boxes while avoiding enemies. Assault is like classic Geometry Wars, where you fight waves of enemies.

 Chromatic Conflict involves killing only enemies that match your ship's current color, which gets a bit tricky and requires observation and patience. Finally, Asteroids is like the classic game of the same name that you've probably played before.

 As if these game modes aren't enough, PewPew also has playable ships to unlock and leaderboards to climb. It's incredible how this game is free with no strings attached.

**Download:** PewPew on[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jyaif.pewpew) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/pewpew/id314964252) (Free)

## 7\. Underhand

 Want something completely free but also unique? Then check out Underhand by Spoopy Squadâ€”there's nothing else like it.

 Underhand bills itself as a CCG, which usually stands for "collectible card game," but here stands for "cultist card game." That means you take on the role of a cult leader and must manage your cult's resources effectively.

 Meanwhile, you must respond to various event cards drawn from the deck. Your response to events determines the success of your cult and how far it will go.

 Your cult's primary goal is to summon an "Ancient One," but again, this depends on your resource management and success. Otherwise, the cult may fall prey to the trials and tribulations of time itself. Either way, Underhand provides a thrilling choice-based adventure that anyone can enjoy.

 We recommend you carefully go through the tutorial initially because otherwise, you'll likely end up getting lost. However, once you start playing, it's hard to stop.

**Download:** Underhand by Spoopy Squad for[Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand) (Free)
