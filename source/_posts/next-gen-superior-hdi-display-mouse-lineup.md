## Next-Gen, Superior HDI Display Mouse Lineup

 You’ve put in the hard work it takes to improve your K/D ratio and muscle memory, but now there’s a wall that can’t be toppled without the best high DPI gaming mice. The mouse you picked up in the bargain bin isn’t cutting it, either; in fact, it’s holding you back.

 Not every computer mouse is the same. Some assist different hand grips—like claw, fingertip, and palm—while others have higher DPI or extra buttons. Many have all of the above. One thing is clear: having a higher DPI gaming mouse can shorten the gap exponentially between your reaction time and a computer mouse’s response time.

Here are the best high DPI gaming mice available today.

## Our Favorite High DPI Gaming Mice
![steelseries prime from side](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/prime-mouse.jpg)

##### SteelSeries Prime Wireless

Best Overall

 Wireless Powerhouse Perfect for Gaming

 $70$130 Save $60

 The SteelSeries Prime is a long-lasting gaming mouse equipped with optical magnetic switches and an 18K DPI optical sensor. It also has five programmable buttons and a 100-hour rechargeable battery.

**Pros**

* USB-C connection for wired support
* Soft curves are ideal for right-handers
* Awesome battery life

**Cons**

* High-efficiency mode stunts its performance
* Thumb buttons should be more distinct

[$70 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LTGTKP?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004819&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-high-dpi-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$130 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsteelseries-prime-esport-mini-lightweight-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-over-100-hour-battery-life-black%2F6480554.p%3FskuId%3D6480554)

 The SteelSeries Prime makes a compelling case for right-handed individuals looking for a powerful wireless mouse. It brings performance, a smart design that fits the hand wonderfully, and awesome battery life. The SteelSeries Prime sports an 18,000 DPI TrueMove Air optical sensor.

 Despite being wireless, it has 1-to-1 tracking, coupled with a response time that relies on light for practically instantaneous reactions. And you get that great performance for up to 40 hours. That’s in performance mode, though. High-efficiency mode stunts its performance—otherwise, it would last up to 100 hours.

 Speaking of design, right hands will feel at home with the slopes and curves of the mouse. The curves are just soft enough to add some grip but still allow your hand to embrace it lovingly. The thumb buttons could be more distinct; the small gap between each thumb button isn’t quite distinguishable enough to make them feel separate.

![corsair katar pro xt packaging](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/katar-mouse.jpg)

##### Corsair Katar Pro XT

Best Value

Awesome Package for a Great Price

 The Corsair Katar Pro XT is an ultra-light gaming mouse with an 18K DPI optical sensor. It also has six programmable buttons and RGB, making it a great addition to your gaming setup.

**Pros**

* Lightweight paracord cable
* Spring-loaded switches
* Lighter weight for faster strafing
* Comfortable and reliable design

**Cons**

* Doesn?t have rubber sides

[$35 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SHCKVTG?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004819&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-high-dpi-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate)

 Budget seekers rejoice, for the Corsair Katar Pro XT is a fine example of a high DPI gaming mouse with a clean design and solid features. It’s built to offer the traits most necessary for split-second decisions and fast-action performance. Take the cable, for example. Its paracord cable reduces the amount of drag you’d experience from whipping the mouse from one place to the next. And with how light it is, at 73g, you’ll have ample opportunity to make quick, tighter movements.

 The Corsair Katar Pro XT’s design is best suited for fingertip and claw grip styles due to its symmetrical design. Both styles are best at taking advantage of its 18,000 DPI PixArt optical sensor, which is customizable in 1 DPI steps for incredible precision.

 The two thumb buttons illustrate a similar legacy with a spring-loaded design for faster clicks per second. If you're looking to add another Corsair peripheral to your gaming setup, the Corsair Katar Pro XT is an affordable yet powerful choice.

##### Razer Basilisk V3 Pro

 $132$160 Save $28

 The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is a feature-rich gaming mouse, kitted out with a fast and accurate optical sensor. Along with a maximum DPI of 30K, it has 11 buttons you can program to your liking.

**Pros**

* Optical sensor has a maximum 30K DPI

 Everything and the kitchen sink—that's the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro in a nutshell. Not only is it an incredibly accurate gaming mouse with an equally impressive DPI ceiling, but it's also got all the workings baked into its design.

 Take the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro's shape, for example, which is curved in such a way as to support both a claw and palm grip. There's even some lovely texture along the sides to help keep your grip secure even when your hands get a bit sweaty.

 What you'll find particularly useful is just how high the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro's DPI can go. You can adjust it on the fly using the DPI buttons near the scroll wheel. But it's in Razer's Synapse 3 software that you can properly customize the DPI in very small increments, all the way up to 30K.

![back of cooler master mm720](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mm720-mouse.jpg)

##### Cooler Master MM720

Lightest Weight

 Lightweight, Accurate, and Has a High DPI Ceiling

 $16$38 Save $22

 The Cooler Master MM720 rewrites gaming mouse design philosophy with its honeycomb top, ring finger rest, and lighter weight. It also has a 16K DPI optical sensor and five programmable buttons.

**Pros**

* Low-drag braided cable
* Glides nicely thanks to PTFE feet and low weight
* Ideal for FPS titles
* Weighs just 49g

**Cons**

* Design is suited for claw grips only

[$16 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTH1YCD?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004819&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-high-dpi-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$43 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcooler-master-mm-720-kkol1-mm720-wired%2Fp%2F2RC-0051-00025)

 Gamers hitting the very competitive FPS scene should reconsider the design of their mouse. Traditions are made to be broken, and the Cooler Master MM720 embodies that sentiment. Taking a look at its shape, it appears alien—not to mention seemingly awkwardly shaped. There’s a rhyme and reason, however.

 For starters, its honeycomb design reduces the overall weight of the mouse down to 49g. Coupled with its PTFE feet, the Cooler Master MM720 glides beautifully across surfaces. And with a 16,000 DPI, it creates the perfect environment for improving your performance in FPS titles.

 It has a few other quirks that take some getting used to, though. It’s primarily designed for a claw grip; a palm grip is out of the question. With that said, the slightly wider backend curves into a resting place for your ring finger. It’s a nice touch you hardly see with gaming mice, and it means fewer fingers are dragging across the mousepad.

##### Razer Naga Trinity

Best for MMOs

 Why Limit Yourself to Two Buttons When You Can Have 12?

 $80$100 Save $20

 With 12 extra buttons, the Razer Naga Trinity is your go-to gaming mouse if you frequently play MMOs. It also has interchangeable plates with fewer buttons if, say, you're playing an FPS.

**Pros**

* 12 extra buttons; 19 programmable buttons altogether
* Includes swappable panels with different button configurations
* Accurate and precise 16K DPI optical sensor
* Good feeling scroll wheel

**Cons**

* Has a learning curve

 MOBAs, first-person shooters, MMOs—no matter what genre you play, having a few extra buttons on your mouse can greatly improve your performance. It varies between genres, and we certainly won't suggest buying multiple gaming mice to fit every situation, not while the Razer Naga Trinity is an option.

 First off, the Razer Naga Trinity features three interchangeable side plates: one with two buttons, another with seven buttons, and the third with twelve buttons. That means no matter what the situation calls for, whether it's a quick team deathmatch or a raid night, the extra buttons give you greater command over the game.

 Lastly, and more importantly, the Razer Naga Trinity has an optical sensor, which uses a light beam to register clicks faster than a mechanical switch. Using the DPI button near the scroll wheel, you can then configure the optical sensor up to a maximum DPI of 16K.

 $106$160 Save $54

**Pros**

* 70-hour rechargeable battery
* Insanely low friction
* Ambidextrous design
* DPI up to 25,600

**Cons**

[$106 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087LXCTFJ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004819&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-high-dpi-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$160 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-pro-x-superlight-lightweight-wireless-optical-gaming-mouse-with-hero-25k-sensor-black%2F6440334.p%3FskuId%3D6440334)

 The Logitech G Pro is a good gaming mouse all around and is a popular option. As great as it is, it could be better, which is where the Logitech G Pro X Superlight comes in.

 Everything that made the Logitech G Pro good has been improved, right down to the feet. Combined with a lighter build—80 grams compared to the Superlight's 63 grams—the superior PTFE feet make sudden turns and flicks feel fluid and effortless. Thankfully, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight features the Hero 25K Sensor, ensuring it'll keep up with your quick movements.

 You know what else keeps things light? Not having a cable that causes all sorts of friction. Given the Logitech G Pro X Superlight's wireless performance, you won't even notice it's gone. What's even better is that the battery life lasts a whopping 70 hours!

![left side glorious model d-](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/model-d-mouse.jpg)

##### Glorious Model D-

Best Cooling

 For When You Know Your Hand Get Sweaty

 $35$60 Save $25

**Pros**

* Flexible braided cable
* Feels good in small hands

**Cons**

[$35 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Model-Gaming-Mouse-Minus/dp/B088C4X4HP?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2004819&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-high-dpi-gaming-mice%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$50 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fglorious-model-d-wired-optical-honeycomb-rgb-gaming-mouse-matte-black%2F6517422.p%3FskuId%3D6517422)

 If Battle Royale games and shooters are your bread and butter, the Glorious Mode D- could be your next perfect purchase. Do you use a palm grip or claw-grip hybrid? Are your hands on the smaller side? Then it has what you need.

 Two of the most important features you’ll need are a high DPI mouse with as little friction as possible and low weight. The Glorious Model D- hits both marks with PTFE feet that keep flicks smooth as butter and a weight of 61g. Combine that with its 12,000 DPI that handles 50G of acceleration, and you get one slick experience.

## Choosing the Best High DPI Gaming Mouse For You

 It's not enough to find a gaming mouse with a high enough DPI for your needs. You should also consider outlying features like the number of buttons, wired versus wireless, and weight.

 The SteelSeries Prime Wireless checks a lot of boxes, from a fairly uniform design to performance. It even has the benefit of being both wired and wireless, with a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 100 hours.

 If budget is a concern, the Corsair Katar Pro XT has insane value. The design is equally good, lightweight, and it's quite comfortable. Its mouse buttons are particularly nice, given their spring-loaded switches.
