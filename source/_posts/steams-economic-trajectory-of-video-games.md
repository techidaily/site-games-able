 Steam doesn't have a built-in way to see a game's price history, but luckily SteamDB offers a way to track this metric. Here's how to use the website so you can figure out if a deal is worth it.

## How to Check a Steam Game's Price History on SteamDB

[SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) is a database website that keeps track of various Steam metrics such as the most played games, trending games, and Steam sales. However, one of its most useful features is the ability to track a game's price history.

 When you just click on a game on the website's front page, the price history can be a little buried. So you should rather search for the specific game whose information you want to see.

Here's how you can access the price history of a Steam game:

1. Go to the [SteamDB website](https://steamdb.info/) .
2. In the search bar at the top of the screen, type in the game whose price history you want to see. In this example, we'll look at Baldur's Gate 3.
3. Click on the game's title when it appears in the search results.

 This will take you to a page that includes information about the game. You can scroll down to see its price history. If you selected the game from the website's home page, however, it will default to the**Charts** tab, so make sure you select the**Price history** tab on the left.

 On the right side of the page, you can set the currency you want to use. You should also note that the price history does not include the price of a game's DLC. You will have to search for the DLC separately to track its price history.

 The chart will also show you the price changes for the game in other currencies, along with the lowest recorded price for the game. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3, the current price is listed as $59.99 and its lowest recorded price was $53.99 (a 10% discount).

 So how can you use this information to your advantage? Well, firstly, when there's a sale, you can see whether the discount offered is the best deal the game has offered. You can also see how often a game goes on sale using the price history chart, so that you can predict whether you should hold out for another sale.

 Players will also be able to check if a price has increased since launch. You'll see this most often with games that were in Early Access or that had a launch sale, but is also helps you avoid price gouging.

## Why a Game Might Not Have a Price History on Steam

 Occasionally, you may come across a game that has no price history. This usually applies to free-to-play games like Dota 2.

 For games like PUBG: Battlegrounds, the current price is listed as N/A. This is because while the game was previously paid for, it has since moved to free-to-play.

## Other Ways to Check Whether a Game Deal Is Worth It

 There are other websites that focus on tracking the price history of Steam games. For example,[GG.Deals](https://gg.deals/) focuses on highlighting games with historical lows on Steam as well as other storefronts.

 The drawback of this site is that it also highlights prices from game key shops, which are not always safe to buy from. You can see more about this topic in our guide on [whether game key sites are safe](https://www.makeuseof.com/are-game-keys-safe/) .

 You can also use [SteamPriceHistory.com](https://steampricehistory.com/) to see a quick overview of discounts on the platform. However, SteamDB remains the most comprehensive tool.

 There are other [ways to get the best deals on Steam games](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-to-make-sure-you-get-the-best-deals-on-steam-games/) . For example, you can add games to your wishlist so that you receive a notification when the game's price drops. You can also wait for major annual sales such as the Steam Summer Sale.

 Now you have all the tools you need to check whether a sale is offering an actual discount and not simply providing discounts on price-gouged games. Hopefully this will help you find the best discount possible.
