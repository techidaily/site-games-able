## Premier Gamers' Progress Recorders

 It's difficult to keep track of your video game collection, especially if it's digital and across multiple platforms. To solve this, use a video game tracker service to manage your collection so you know what you own, what you need to complete, and what you want to buy in the future.

 We've rounded up some of the best services to keep track of your games. Think of them as the Goodreads for video games, or the Letterboxd for video games.

These are the best video game trackers.

## 1. Grouvee

![grouvee](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/grouvee-game-page.jpg)

 Grouvee has a clean interface and is easy to navigate. It's bound to have any game you want to track because it's powered by Giant Bomb's API (a user-editable wiki).

 Each video game entry contains the average rating from Grouvee users, a quick summary of the game, release date, platforms, publisher, and other useful information.

 You can assign a status to any game: played, playing, wish list, backlog. If none fit, use "other shelf" to create as many categories as you'd like to further organize your games. You can also select on which systems you played the gameâ€”since you might own it on multiple formats, as there are[big differences between PC and console](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/switching-from-console-to-pc-gaming-8-big-differences-explained/) .

 Going beyond simply cataloging, Grouvee lets you leave comments to share your thoughts on the game as you play it. These are highlighted prominently on game pages, which makes Grouvee a logical choice if you're after a Goodreads for gaming. You can also track how long it took you to finish a game and what level of completion you achieved.

## 2. GG

![gg](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gg.jpg)

 GG is a stylish website that focuses on the simple features you need from a video game tracker.

 From the Explore page, find a specific game or look at trending and newly released games. Each game page features information like release date and genre, screenshots, and the ability to add a review.

 Importantly, you can quickly set your play status for each game. These include options like playing, beaten, and abandoned. Alternatively, create your own custom list if none of these options suit.

 One downside to GG is that you need a paid membership to clone existing lists or merge your own. This can make it quite cumbersome when you first create your game collection as you have to go into each game manually. You also can't specify which platform you own the game on.

## 3. Completionator

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Completionator is a fantastic choice as a simple video game tracker, but it's also packed full of extra features if you want to take it to the next level.

 It's really easy to create your game collection because you can import your Steam library, alongside importing any lists that you have manually created.

 You get lots of options to track video games, like what platform you own the games on, what condition they're in, your current play status, and more. Cleverly, the site provides an estimated value for your collection.

 Something that makes Completionator different is its social aspect. It has a forum to chat with others. More interesting, though, is the ability to complete challenges set by other people. This is like a book club, where you all agree to complete a game and discuss it after.

## 4. HowLongToBeat

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 As you might guess from the name, HowLongToBeat was designed as a way to find out the length of a game. That's useful to know if you have a limited amount of time to play or want to crack through your backlog with the shortest games (which is one way to[decide what game to buy next](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/decide-what-game-to-buy-next/) .)

 The site also functions as a video game tracker; add games to your backlog and mark their completion state, like whether you only tackled the main story or if you went all out and did the extras too.

 You can import your Steam games and HowLongToBeat will add them to your catalog, which is wonderfully convenient. If you like, sort through these to see how long you will spend playing each one.

 The site is powered by community contribution, so be sure to let others know how long it takes you to complete a game once you've finished with it.

## 5. Darkadia

![Darkadia](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Darkadia.png)

 When most of our games are digital nowadays, it's a shame to miss out on the satisfaction of seeing everything lined up on shelves (an important factor when[comparing physical games against digital games](https://www.makeuseof.com/physical-games-vs-digital-games-best-to-buy/) .) That's where video game tracker Darkadia comes in, which brings your virtual collection to life.

 Once you add a game to your shelf, you're able to browse through all of them at a glance. Click into a game to see information about it, like its release date and developer.

 Importantly, there are many ways to tag your collection. You can mark the different play states (like completed or mastered), along with the date you achieved these and how long it took.

 Two excellent features include the ability to add private notes to a game (perhaps to record its digital game key), plus an export functionality so that you're not tied into Darkadia's platform.

## 6. The Backloggery

![Backloggery](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backloggery.png)

 Backloggery is a simple service compared to others listed here, but it still works as a way to catalog your video games.

 The biggest difference between Backloggery and the other systems is that it doesn't provide integration with a video game database and so you don't get to see box art, screenshots, or other nice features. Instead of adding specific game entries to your account, you're presented with a number of blank fields.

 You fill in the name, system, and region of the game alongside its completion status. Although this provides some flexibility to manage your games however you'd like, it's more cumbersome an experience than the other sites due to the manual nature. Nevertheless, if you want a simple video game tracker, Backloggery serves its purpose.

 Backloggd is a free service to track your video games from all platforms. Use it to log the games you own, are currently playing, and have played. You can also build a wishlist, since Backloggd's catalog includes games which aren't yet released.

 Your library is easily searchable through filters and sorting mechanisms, and you can rate and review games to remind yourself of what you thought of them. Plus, there's an active community, which lets you engage with other players and compare your libraries.

 If you love data, Backloggd has you covered. It provides extensive stats about your library, like your top genres, how the library has grown over the years, your favored platforms, the ownership breakdown (digital, subscription, or physical), and so much more.

 All of this comes on a video game tracker website that is well-designed, easy to navigate, and continually updated. It's an excellent choice.
