## Achievement Acres: Gamer's Sanctuaries

 Games can offer rich and expansive worlds for you to explore, with fantastic stories weaved throughout the lands. Naturally, you may find yourself spending a lot of time on games. For many gamers, part of the appeal of playing through a title is "100%ing it". In other words, obtaining every Xbox Achievement, PlayStation Trophy, or Steam Achievement listed on a game.

 There are a lot of trophy hunters out there, perhaps you're one of them. You'll be pleased to know there are plenty of communities full of like-minded gamers, from forums to Subreddits or Discord servers.

 Whether you need to find someone to help you with a multiplayer trophy for an old game with barely any players, or you just want to hang out and discuss trophy hunting or gaming with similar gamers, the communities will have something to offer.

## 1. PSTrophies

![A trophy guide on the PlayStation Trophies website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/playstation-trophies-guide.jpg)

 One of the oldest and most popular trophy hunting communities, PSTrophies is home to guides for just about any PlayStation title you can find. The guides are well-written, formatted, and typically offer you a difficulty-to-Platinum rating out of 10 for a particular title.

 Guides will typically offer a passage of context about the game and anything you need to know about the game or its trophies. After that, you'll have a list of each unlockable trophy in the game, along with a two or three-line description of how to obtain it.

 If you click on the name of a particular trophy, you'll be taken to a page offering a list of PSTrophies users who first unlocked it and recently unlocked it, as well as a comments section where users can ask for help or solve a problem to a particularly tough trophy.

 The site also offers news of upcoming releases in the gaming industry, as well as previews, reviews, interviews, and feature articles. And to top it all off—a highly-populated [big gaming forum](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/big-gaming-forums-video-game-talk/) for you to connect with like-minded gamers. PSTrophies really is the ultimate all-in-one place for committed trophy hunters looking to join a community.

## 2. TrueTrophies

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 TrueTrophies has trophy lists for pretty much any PlayStation game you can think of. By clicking on a particular game, you'll be taken to the list of [PlayStation trophies](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-playstation-trophies-what-do-they-do/) , where the official description will be listed for it.

 By clicking on the trophy name, you'll be taken to a page for that particular trophy, where any guides written by members of the community will be. Most popular games will have trophy guides written for, but you should keep in mind that some more obscure or older titles may not have a guide for certain trophies.

 The site also publishes news, features, interviews, and reviews of games to keep you occupied. And if you want to connect with other trophy hunters or get help with a specific trophy, the site has a forum filled with active members.

## 3. Achievement Hunting

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Steam has achievements too, but doesn't tend to have as many hunters. If you hunt for achievements on Steam, then the Achievement Hunting website could prove to be a boon. Packed with guides and resources to help with your achievement hunting hobby, it also has an active Discord server with nearly a thousand users.

 While it is a dedicated place for Steam players, that doesn't mean the community is restricted to PC. You'll find dedicated channels in the server for both Xbox and PlayStation.

 The community also has dedicated channels for both Warframe and Payday, owing to a lot of the members being active on those titles. If you are a big fan of either of those games, that's even more incentive to join this achievement hunting community.

## 4. PlayStation Trophy Hunters (Discord)

![The PlayStation trophy hunters server on the Discord desktop app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/playstation-trophy-hunters-discord.jpg)

 If you regularly use Discord and prefer more real-time chat with like-minded trophy hunters, then you'll love the PlayStation Trophy Hunters Discord. With over a thousand members, you can expect to see a lot of discussion, fan art, memes, polls, and group events through participating on the server.

 Generally, there's a high chance you'll be able to get help with a specific trophy, though you may have to experiment with which channels of the server and at what time of day you ask for help. If you use Discord daily and hunt for Trophies on PlayStation, you'll likely benefit from this community.

## 5. r/Trophies

![The Trophies subreddit on Reddit](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/reddit-trophies-sub.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The Trophies Subreddit has been around for a long time, and is well-populated with over a 100,000 members, making it a Top 1% community on Reddit. The Sub is filled with people posting Platinums they've recently obtained, discussing elements of trophy hunting or particular games, and generally uplifting each other in the pursuit of Platinum.

 It's a great community to be a part of if you play on PlayStation, use Reddit regularly, and want to share the Platinums you achieve. Don't expect to find people for boosting particular trophies, though–the nature of Reddit makes these subreddits an inefficient place to do so. Use this community more for discussing elements of trophy hunting with others or sharing the Platinums you've recently obtained.

## 6. r/XboxAchievements

![The Xbox Achievements subreddit on Reddit](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-achievements-sub.jpg)

 The counterpart to r/Trophies, r/XboxAchievements is the dedicated Subreddit if you play on Xbox and strive to achieve the 1000G on everything you play.

 This Subreddit is filled with people posting the 1000Gs they've recently got on games, and discussing elements of achievement hunting with each other. Pairing this Subreddit with the [Xbox Achievements beginner's guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/xbox-achievements-beginners-guide/) will get you earning Xbox gold in no time.

 If you're looking for help with specific trophies, this subreddit is probably not the right place to go. Forums or dedicated game-Subs are usually a better place to go to for that. r/XboxAchievements is, however, a perfect community to join if you regularly play Xbox, regularly use Reddit, and enjoy sharing the games you've maxed out on achievements.

## 7. PSNProfiles

![The home page of the PSNProfiles website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/psnprofiles-home.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 PSNProfiles is a sleek platform that puts your PlayStation profile and trophies in the spotlight in a cool, social way; enriching the trophy hunting experience. By creating an account, you'll have a dedicated card created for your PlayStation profile.

 Guides and walkthroughs for most PlayStation titles feature on the site, as do news, features, reviews, interviews, and video content for you to read and watch to keep up to date with the latest games.

 The PSNProfiles forum is pretty active, giving you access to a community of like-minded trophy hunters that can help you with particular trophies. The profile trophy card that the site creates for you integrates quite well with other platforms on the web, making the platform a must-have in your trophy hunting arsenal.

## 8. PlayStation Trophy Hunters (Facebook)

 PlayStation Trophy Hunters is a group of over 60,000 PlayStation gamers that enjoy hunting for trophies. A Facebook group, you can expect to find discussions, polls, and memes about trophy hunting all on the Facebook app. Facebook Groups tend to have highly active communities across the board, so if you regularly use Facebook, joining this group is a no-brainer.

 As with other social media trophy hunting communities, you shouldn't expect this FB Group to be a great place for getting help with particular trophies. With the sheer volume of people in the group, it'd be worth creating a post and asking, but forums or specific game FB Groups would be a more effective method.

## 9\. Specific Game Subreddits

 If a game exists, there is usually a Subreddit for it. Not every game gets coverage on Reddit, so you shouldn't necessarily expect the game you're playing to have a large community on the platform. You could be pleasantly surprised, however, and find hundreds of active users discussing the game and willing to play with others to help them find trophies.

 Being able to find people for your trophy hunting needs without having to venture off Reddit can be helpful if you're usually using the app regularly anyway. You don't have to spend any time learning how to navigate a new website or app because you're already used to Reddit.

## Turn Your Trophy Hunting Social

 Trophy and achievement hunting is fun for plenty of people, and it's the type of thing that should be shared with others. There can often be times when you need help from other people to obtain a particular trophy in a game, and these communities can be a huge help.

 At the very least, forums offer a place for you to discuss games and potentially make friends with others online. And if you're looking for some games that are easy to complete, there are a bunch of PlayStation titles you can quickly Platinum.
