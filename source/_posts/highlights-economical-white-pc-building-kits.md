## Highlights: Economical White PC Building Kits

 The dark palette of your typical motherboard is nice, but striking, icy white motherboards can really make your components pop. Of course, it’s purely aesthetics and doesn’t offer any performance benefits, but if you want a specific color scheme for your build, the best white motherboards are a good place to start.

## Best AMD Overall: ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A
![ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A best white amd motherboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asus-rog-strix-x670e-a-best-white-amd-motherboard.png)

ASUS

 If you’re putting together a high-performance AMD build, the [ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-X670E-Motherboard-Cooling/dp/B0BDV6RR2K?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2023999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-white-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is, without a doubt, the strongest contender, especially paired with a powerful [NVIDIA or AMD GPU](https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-gpu-alternatives-nvidias-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-16gb/) . With its available ports, overclock support, and a bevy of heatsinks, you can really push your rig.

 Want faster load times, smoother gameplay, and a snappier OS? Given its two Gen 5-ready NVMe slots, you can use one for your OS and another for storing your favorite games. As a bonus, there are also two Gen 4 M.2 slots, which are quite useful for older games or ones you only play occasionally.

 The ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A is fitted with an AM5 socket, giving you access to AMD’s powerful Ryzen 7000 series CPUs. That kind of power can run hot, so be sure to install one of the [best AIO coolers](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-aio-coolers/) , too. It even comes with SafeSlot technology, a feature that should be standard since it helps avoid shearing your GPU, especially if it’s girthy.

![ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A all white gaming motherboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asus-rog-strix-x670e-a-all-white-gaming-motherboard.png)

##### ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A Gaming WiFi

Best AMD Overall

 $340$420 Save $80

 The ASUS ROG Strix X670E-A comes out on top, showing off its support for AM5 CPUs, a wealth of heatsinks, and a stylish off-white finish. Above all, it supports PCIe 5.0 for both SSDs and GPUs.

**Pros**

* Easy to work with, including the BIOS
* Supports DDR5 memory
* Can be hooked up to an AIO
* SafeSlot adds additional support to heavier GPUs

**Cons**

* Doesn't support Thunderbolt

## Best Budget AMD: ASRock B650M Pro RS
![asrock b650m pro rs all white motherboard for amd cpus](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/asrock-b650m-pro-rs-all-white-motherboard-for-amd-cpus.png)

ASRock

 Naturally, budget AMD builds come with sacrifices. Luckily, ASRock did an excellent job designing the [B650M Pro RS](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasrock-b650m-pro-rs%2Fp%2FN82E16813162130) by tightening up its features while still providing many worthwhile benefits.

 For example, while you’re limited to PCIe 4.0 for GPUs, which isn’t a bad thing to begin with, you gain an AM5 socket and DDR5 support in return, the latter of which you can overclock. While its socket does limit your choices to AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series lineup, the ASRock B650M Pro RS is so competitively priced you won’t have a problem finding a CPU that fits your budget.

 Finally, the “Blazing M.2,” as ASRock likes to call it, puts a beautiful bow on the whole package. Ancient HDDs and even lesser SSDs can’t hold a candle to Gen 5 speeds. You not only experience a far more responsive OS, but gaming gains a big boost as well.

##### ASRock B650M Pro RS WiFi

Budget AMD

 $135$160 Save $25

 For any budding PC builder on a budget, the ASRock B650M Pro RS is one of the most straightforward, user-friendly motherboards you can work with. It isn't oversaturated with ports but instead has everything you need to make a high-end AMD build.

**Pros**

* Great option for compact builds
* Can overclock RAM
* Solid set of ports, including USB-C
* Can save a little more going with the non-WiFi option

**Cons**

* Limited to Ryzen 7000 series CPUs

![white motherboard gigabyte z790 aorus pro x](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/white-motherboard-gigabyte-z790-aorus-pro-x.png)

Gigabyte

 If the ultimate gaming rig is what you’re after, the [Gigabyte Z790 AORUS Pro X](https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Z790-AORUS-PRO-Motherboard/dp/B083RW9TJF?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2023999&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fbest-white-motherboards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) doesn’t leave anything on the cutting room floor.

## FAQ

### Q: Does the color of your motherboard matter?

 The color of your motherboard is purely cosmetic and does not affect its performance or durability. Most people prefer a motherboard that matches the color of their computer build or desk peripherals. A white motherboard will give your PC a clean, stunning look that blends well in different setups.

### Q: What does a white motherboard mean?

 A white motherboard is a motherboard with a predominantly white color scheme. While the PCB is usually black on most motherboards, the rest of the components, like heatsinks, VRM cover, and I/O shield, are primarily white.

### Q: How do I know which motherboard I need for my PC?

 It depends entirely on your CPU and GPU. If you haven't decided on those components yet, do that first. Start by picking a processor (AMD or Intel) and then choosing a suitable graphics card. Once you've got that settled, you can start narrowing your search; in fact, our guide on [motherboard specifications and their meanings](https://www.makeuseof.com/motherboard-specs-terms-explained/) breaks down the process succinctly!

### Q: What does the motherboard do on my PC?

 The motherboard allows communication between all the components, from USB ports to the graphics card.

### Q: How can I tell if my motherboard has gone bad?

 If your motherboard has been giving you issues, it may give off a beep, fail to post, or have onboard LEDs that light up if there's a problem with your GPU, CPU, hard drive, and RAM. That's only the tip of the iceberg, though, so if you're attempting to troubleshoot your MOBO, it's best to get familiar with the [signs that your motherboard is dead](https://www.makeuseof.com/signs-your-motherboard-is-dead/) .

### Q: Can I use any CPU with any motherboard?

 No. A motherboard's [CPU socket](http://www.makeuseof.com/lga-vs-pga-cpu-socket-whats-the-difference/) will only accept one of two processors: Intel or AMD. You can't use an AMD processor with an Intel socket and vice versa. Now, that still doesn't mean you can use any processor if, say, you have an Intel CPU and an Intel-based motherboard, as they'll only accept specific generations.

### Q: What does CPU stand for?

 CPU is an acronym for "central processing unit." The CPU is analogous to the brain, carrying out the various tasks and processing data.

### Q: Does the size of the motherboard matter?

 Not at all. Board size doesn't impact performance. You can get the same baseline features, whether it's a mini-ITX or the largest E-ATX. The size of the motherboard only comes into play when it comes to whether it can fit in your PC case.

### Q: Why are most motherboards green?

 Like many of the components, motherboards are quite delicate, given all the bits of electronics and tracks that connect the board's various functions, which you can see if you take a closer look. To add a level of protection, motherboards are encased in a thin resin—the solder mask—and these take on a variety of colors, including green. It's both aesthetically pleasing and pretty useful for making the electronics stand out.
