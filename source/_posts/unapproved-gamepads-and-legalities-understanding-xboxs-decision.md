* If you connect an "unauthorized" controller to your Xbox, you will receive an error code and have two weeks to contact the manufacturer or seek a refund.
* You can still use a majority of third-party controllers that are involved in the Designed for Xbox program or feature an official Xbox logo.

## Why Has Xbox Banned “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controllers?

 If you utilize third-party Xbox controllers, you'll want to know why Xbox restricts your accessory choices. However, Xbox's ban only affects "unauthorized" third-party controllers, as evidenced by[the official Xbox website](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/errors/error-code-0x82d60002) . All third-party accessories involved in the Designed for Xbox program are unaffected.

 As for why Xbox felt the need to ban "unauthorized" third-party accessories and controllers, there are a few main factors:

* Banning "unauthorized" third-party devices allows Xbox to ensure all controllers and accessories on its platform are part of the Designed for Xbox program and safe to use.
* Third-party providers of unofficial Xbox accessories can include devices like Cronus Zen that allow for or make cheating easier.

* By banning unofficial third-party devices, Xbox ensures you can only purchase official or Designed for Xbox accessories and controllers, which encourages Xbox sales.

 So, while there are sales incentives for Xbox, the ban itself acts to quality control the third-party controllers and accessories you can use on Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S.

 However, if you[connect an Xbox controller to your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/) , you can still use unofficial controllers for PC gaming, just not via an Xbox One or Series X|S.

## What Happens if You Use an “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controller

 While Xbox may have had good reason to ban unofficial third-party devices, you will still want to know how your devices are affected by the ban.

 Luckily, how Xbox bans "unauthorized" third-party devices provides you time to return your device or contact the manufacturer. So, regarding what happens if you connect an "unauthorized" third-party device to your Xbox, the process is as follows:

* If you connect an unauthorized controller or accessory to your Xbox console, you will receive the error code:**0x82d60002** .
* From the point of receiving error code**0x82d60002** , you have two weeks before your device is banned from being used with your Xbox.
* Xbox advises that within the two weeks time-frame, you contact the manufacturer of the device or return it to seek a refund.

## What Third-Party Controllers Can You Still Use With Your Xbox?

 Even if your third-party devices receive error code**0x82d60002** , you don't have to abandon third-party Xbox controllers altogether. In fact, despite the ban, you can utilize a vast majority of third-party Xbox devices.

 Xbox still supports third-party devices involved in the Designed for Xbox program. But Xbox also highlights that any third-party controllers that feature an official Xbox logo between the left and right triggers should be useable on all Xbox consoles.
