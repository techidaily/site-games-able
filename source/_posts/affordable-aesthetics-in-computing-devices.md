Best Overall

##### GIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 4090

 A power-house GPU for those on a larger budget

 If you want to splash out on a top-of-the-line graphics card for your PC, you won't find much bigger or better than the GIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 4090.

**Pros**

* 24GB GDDR6X
* 1710 MHz clock speed
* Semi-passive cooling

**Cons**

* Extremely expensive

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-Graphics-WINDFORCE-GV-N4090AORUS-M-24GD/dp/B0BGP87RQ2/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU27271&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Ftag%2Fbest-graphics-cards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$2250 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fgigabyte-geforce-rtx-4090-gv-n4090aorus-m-24gd%2Fp%2FN82E16814932555)

 The GIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 presents excellent performance all around. Playing games with Ray-tracing or 4K turned on will be a breeze, and the customizable RGB gives it that extra edge that gamers will love.

 The triple fan design offers extra cooling where it's needed, which is a welcome addition when you consider the higher clock speed. With 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM and DLSS 3 compatibility, the AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 will be able to handle nearly anything you could think to throw at it.

 However, the fans do make the GIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 4090 slightly larger than most GPUs on offer. This is going to restrict some use, and you'll probably find you need to invest in an anti-sag bracket once fitted in your case.

 Investing in a 40 Series graphics card can get expensive, but the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4060 Ti OC is an affordable way to get started on your journey. This graphics card offers 8GB of GDDR6 RAM with a boost clock speed of 2595MHz.

 For its price, the card doesn't look too unattractive. It also offers a segment-exclusive dual-BIOS, which is going to be useful for users who regularly switch between productivity and gaming.

 Equipped with a triple-slot dual-fan cooler, the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4060 Ti OC keeps things very cool with low noise levels. And, if you switch over to the Quiet BIOS, barely any sound is heard.

Best AMD GPU

##### ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX OC Edition

The most powerful offering from AMD

 $1030$1100 Save $70

 If you are tired of the NVIDIA hype, maybe it's time to take a look at AMDs GPU offerings. The ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX OC Edition is AMDs current flagship GPU.

**Pros**

* Near silent
* Incredible 4K performance
* Great overclocking potential

**Cons**

 When most people look to buy a new graphics card, they tend to focus on offerings from NVIDIA. But AMD is a great alternative, and its flagship card, the ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX OC Edition, offers performance comparable with NVIDIA's 40 series lineup for a fraction of the price.

 The ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX OC Edition comes with an impressive 24GB of VRAM and can reach speeds of 2615 MHz when overclocked, with a 2455 MHz base clock speed.

 Axial-tech fans with dual ball bearings can improve airflow by up to 14 percent, offering much better thermal efficiency, even when overclocking, as well as making sure you always maintain solid performance when gaming, even when playing in 4K.

Best Workstation GPU

##### Nvidia Titan RTX

 The ultimate graphics card with 72 RT cores

 With 24GB of GDDR6 RAM, the NVIDIA Titan RTX is an absolute beast of a graphics card. It's a future-proof option for gaming enthusiasts, even offering the ability to display 8K@60Hz via DisplayPort 1.4.

**Pros**

* 24GB of memory
* NVLink support
* Stylish design

**Cons**

* Expensive
* Runs quite hot

[See at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Titan-RTX-Graphics-Card/dp/B07L8YGDL5?linkCode=ll1&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=16f7e66754a5b0cf8ba14fe334a7707e&language=en%5FUS&ref%5F=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU27271&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Ftag%2Fbest-graphics-cards%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) [$2150 at Newegg](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fnvidia-titan-rtx-900-1g150-2500-000-sb%2Fp%2FN82E16814132084)

 For those who only want the very best in their gaming PC, the NVIDIA Titan RTX delivers power, unlike any other card on the market, with a massive 24GB of GDDR6 RAM and a boosted clock speed of up to 1,770 MHz.

 Primarily the NVIDIA Titan RTX is designed for tasks such as AI and machine learning, but with all that power under the hood, it makes for an impressively over-kill gaming machine graphics card, if you can afford the extra price tag that comes with it. Unlike the NVIDIA Titan V, the NVIDIA Titan RTX utilizes NVLink, allowing you to double the power, although you would be hard-pressed to find a game that would actually make use of that much power.

 So, if you're looking for the best graphics card that will stretch your budget but offers you the most power available, this graphics card is hard to rival.

 If you're looking for a top-end graphics card, but cards such as the 3090 or the Titan V are out of reach, the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti XC3 12GB offers premium performance at a much more reasonable price.

 Not only does the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti XC3 12GB perform amazingly, but it also looks incredible too, with its built-in RGB and sleek design, it compliments most modern PC builds. To top it off, this graphics card looks awesome without causing your build to overheat, thanks to the triple fans and thermal sensors, designed to keep it running smooth and cool.

 You're getting great value for money, ultra-quiet cooling, and a graphics card that packs 12GB of GDDR6X RAM; that's powerful enough for most games, so long as you have a compatible motherboard and CPU to support its performance.

## How to Choose the Right Graphics Card for You

 Choosing the right graphics card for you is highly dependent on what you use your desktop computer for, as well as your budget. There are tons of options out there when it comes to buying a new graphics card, with a wide range of prices. It can often be all too easy to buy a GPU that is wildly overpowered for what you need it for.

 If you are looking to play games, but don't have the budget for a high-end NVIDIA card, thankfully Intel has finally joined the GPU party. The Intel Arc A770 Limited Edition offers incredible performance with a whopping 16GB of VRAM, all for an impressively low price. Not only does this give gamers another option when picking a new [budget graphics card](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-budget-graphics-card/) , but it also provides NVIDIA and AMD with some much-needed competition to help push the companies to build better hardware at more competitive prices.

 For fans of AMD, perhaps it's time to consider upgrading to AMDs latest flagship graphics card, the ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 7900 XTX OC Edition. Not only does it offer incredible 4K gaming performance, as well as having impressive overclocking potential, but it also comes at a fraction of the price of NVIDIAs 40 series cards.

 And if money isn't an object, instead your sole focus is to buy the biggest, baddest, and most ludicrously expensive GPU, brace yourself and your wallet for the GIGABYTE AORUS GeForce RTX 4090\. It comes with a massive 24GB GDDR6X RAM, 1710 MHz base clock speeds, and ultra-silent semi-passive cooling, which only uses the fans when they are really needed.
