* You will then be faced with a terms and conditions pop-up. Select**Confirm** to register your Xbox.

 Alternatively, if your Xbox isn't listed under**Devices** , you can select**Register device** and input the serial number of your Xbox Series X|S to register your console manually.

 But with your repair paid for and the delivery method selected, you can expect your Xbox to be fixed and returned to you very soon, or at least depending upon your chosen delivery method.

 However, if you find the price tag for a repair to be too expensive, there are plenty of Xbox issues that are fixable at home. For instance,[fixing Xbox Wireless Controller stick drift](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-xbox-one-controller-drift/) can be easy and doesn't necessarily require replacements or an official repair.

## Repair Your Xbox Series X|S Officially and Efficiently

 By repairing and fixing your Xbox Series X|S through the official Xbox repair service, you guarantee an effective and streamlined process for fixing the issues with your Xbox console. And while the service can be quite expensive compared to external repair shops, the process is more reliable.

 With a console under warranty, it could even be less expensive as Xbox could repair your console for free, just as long as you pay for delivery. Either way, if you want an easy and effective repair service for your Xbox, utilizing Xbox's official service is likely your best bet.
