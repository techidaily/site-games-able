 At the heart of any gaming PC lies the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). These two components work in tandem to handle the complex calculations and rendering required for gaming.

 Depending on what type of games you primarily want to play, prioritizing either a better CPU or GPU can be a smart decision if you're on a tight budget.

 Games that perform better with a strong CPU are often those that are heavily reliant on physics calculations, artificial intelligence (NPCs), and complex simulations. These include:

* **Real-time strategy (RTS) games:** Titles like StarCraft II or Age of Empires prioritize CPU power for handling numerous units, AI calculations, and game logic.
* **Massive multiplayer online games (MMOs):** Games like World of Warcraft or Albion Online benefit from strong CPU performance to handle player interactions, NPC behaviors, and world events.
* **Simulation games:** Titles such as Cities: Skylines or Flight Simulator require robust CPU performance for simulating detailed environments, traffic, weather, and physics.

 On the other hand, games that demand better GPU performance rely heavily on rendering and visual effects, such as:

* **First-person shooters (FPS):** Games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Cyberpunk 2077 prioritize GPU power for rendering detailed environments, character models, and special effects.
* **Open-world games:** Titles such as Assassin's Creed or Red Dead Redemption require strong GPU performance to render vast, visually stunning landscapes and complex lighting effects.
* **Virtual reality (VR) games:** VR titles like Half-Life: Alyx or Beat Saber demand high GPU performance to maintain smooth frame rates and render immersive 3D environments for an optimal VR experience.

 It should be noted that all modern games today require [a well-rounded PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/well-rounded-pc-buying-guide/) to play smoothly. So, it is still important to strike a balance between both components so as not to encounter any bottlenecks when gaming.

 When shopping for CPUs, look for models with high clock speeds and multiple cores to ensure smooth gameplay and multitasking capabilities. As for GPUs, look for faster clock speeds, more VRAM, and higher CUDA Cores (NVIDIA) or Stream Processors/Compute Units (AMD).

 Remember, prioritizing one component over the other is fine as long as both the CPU and GPU are working at around the same capacity when gaming.

## 2 RAM
![Two RAM sticks on top of a computer motherboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/two-ram-sticks-on-top-of-a-computer-motherboard.jpg)

 Both the GPU and CPU require fast memory to store temporary data while gaming. GPUs already come integrated with their own Video Random Access Memory (VRAM), while CPUs require a separate Random Access Memory (RAM) component which you’ll need to purchase and install on your motherboard.

When buying RAM, here are the specifications you need to check out:

* **Memory Size:** Measured in Gigabytes (GB). Indicates the maximum amount of memory a stick of RAM can store.
* **Speed:** Depending on the manufacturer, RAM speed can be measured in mega-transfers per second (MT/s) or megahertz (MHz). Mega-transfer measures the amount of data RAM can transfer per second, while megahertz measures the frequency or clock speed of the RAM.
* **DDR Generation:** DDR (Dual Data Rate) RAM currently has five generations. The most common RAM generation used today is DDR4, with DDR3 becoming obsolete, and DDR5 gaining adoption on newer PCs. Each RAM generation has a different number of pins and pin layout. Make sure to check what DDR generation your motherboard supports.

 Opt for at least 16GB of RAM to ensure smooth gameplay and multitasking capabilities. Higher capacities can further improve performance, especially in memory-intensive games or applications.

 In terms of speed, you'll want to choose RAM no slower than 3000 MHz /MT/s for DDR4 compatible motherboards and RAM speeds of at least 5000 Mhz/MTs for DDR5\. Due to labeling mistakes in the past becoming a common convention today,[RAM data rate and frequency rates have become quite a confusing](https://www.makeuseof.com/mts-vs-mhz-datarate-vs-frequency-in-ram-explained/) topic.

 There is no need to worry about it right now as it doesn't really affect performance. As long as you don't go below 3000 MHz /MT/s for DDR4 and 5000 Mhz/MTs for DDR5, your gaming PC should work fine.

## 3 A Solid State Drive (SSD)

 Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have become essential storage for gamers due to their fast read and write speeds. With a good SSD, game load times are significantly reduced, while also improving overall system responsiveness.

 SSDs can come in many different types, versions, and form factors. But for gaming, all you really need to be concerned about is the memory capacity and type.

 There are two types of SSDs: SATA and NVMe. SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a standard interface used for connecting storage devices such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) to a computer's motherboard. While NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) provides better performance by using a PCIE slot for faster data transfer at lower latencies.

 Unless you already have a SATA SSD lying around, we won't recommend them anymore, since the price difference between SATA and NVMe SSDs is negligible. Get yourself an NVMe M.2 drive with at least 1 terabyte of capacity. It should be faster, easier to install, and be around the same price as any SATA SSDs available today.

## 4 Cooling System

 Installing high-performance components on your gaming rig makes overheating more likely. To ensure you can continue gaming for extended periods of time, finding an effective cooling system is essential.

 Air cooling solutions, such as aftermarket CPU coolers and case fans, provide adequate thermal dissipation for most gaming setups. For enthusiasts pushing the limits with overclocking or high-performance components, liquid cooling solutions offer superior heat dissipation and quieter operation.

 We recommend getting an AIO (All-In-One) liquid cooler, as it provides better CPU cooling, while also being relatively easy to install and maintain. When choosing an AIO, consider factors such as radiator size, pump noise, and coolant type when choosing a liquid cooling setup.

 As for fans, always make sure to fill all the available fan slots within your PC case. Having fewer but bigger case fans can make your gaming rig quieter, while having smaller case fans allows for an extra two to five extra fans which can provide stronger air pressure, albeit being noisier and messier to install and maintain. Of course, if you can afford it, expensive solutions such as [MagLev PC fans](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-maglev-pc-fans-how-do-they-work/) and [iCUE LINK](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-corsairs-icue-link-reasons-to-upgrade/) are always available.

## 5 A High Refresh Rate Monitor

 A high refresh rate monitor can elevate your gaming experience by displaying more frames per second, resulting in smoother motion and reduced input lag. Aim for a monitor with a refresh rate of at least 144Hz, though higher refresh rates, such as 240Hz or even 360Hz, are available for those seeking the utmost fluidity.

 Additionally, look for features such as adaptive sync technologies (NVIDIA G-SYNC or AMD FreeSync) to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering for a tear-free gaming experience.

## 6 Other PC Parts to Consider

 Beyond the core components mentioned above, several other parts play a crucial role in building a gaming PC:

* **Motherboard** : Choose a motherboard that supports your chosen CPU, GPU, and RAM and which offers features like overclocking support, ample connectivity options, and future upgradeability.
* **Power supply** : Invest in a reliable power supply unit (PSU) with sufficient wattage to power your components safely, while also considering any potential upgrades in the future. Make sure that the power supply can support all the new components on your gaming rig.
* **Case** : Select a case that not only accommodates your chosen components but also offers good airflow, cable management, and aesthetics to suit your preferences. A bigger case allows room for bigger components as well as more case fans, which can help cool the system better.

 In conclusion, when building a gaming PC, prioritize the CPU and GPU for raw processing power, complemented by ample RAM and fast storage for smooth performance. Invest in a robust cooling system to maintain optimal temperatures and pair your setup with a high refresh rate monitor for a truly immersive gaming experience. Finally, consider the compatibility of all components and invest in quality parts to future-proof your gaming rig for years to come.
