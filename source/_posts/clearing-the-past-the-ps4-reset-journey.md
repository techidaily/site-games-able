## Why Factory Reset Your PS4?

 A PS4 factory reset, also known as initializing the system, is a process that restores the console to its original factory settings. This effectively erases all user data, meaning that all accounts, game saves, settings, and downloaded content will be wiped from the console, leaving it as if it were fresh out of the box.

 There are various[reasons why you'd want to factory reset your PS4](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-factory-reset-ps4/) . If you find your PS4 glitching or running slower than usual, a factory reset can often be the solution. By wiping the slate clean and restoring your PS4 to its factory settings, you eliminate any potential software conflicts or corrupted data that may be causing the problem.

 If you plan to factory reset your PS4 to fix performance issues, remember that this is the last resort. It takes a lot of time and wipes everything clean. You'll have to set up your console from scratch, reinstalling all your games and apps. Only go for it when you’ve tried everything else!

 It's also a good idea to[factory reset your PS4 before you sell it](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-reset-ps4-ready-sell/) . This ensures that your personal data (including saved games, login credentials, and any sensitive information like payment information) is erased.

 On the flip side, if you’ve got a used PS4 and the previous owner hasn’t factory reset it, you can reset it to remove any traces of their data.

## How to Factory Reset Your PS4

 If you don't have a boot issue with your PS4 and your console turns on just fine, you can reset your console using one of the options in the settings. However, you should deactivate your account on your PS4 before resetting it to avoid any complications when signing in later.

 If you have important data that's going to be lost or difficult to download after the reset, you can safely[back up your PS4 data](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-back-up-restore-ps4-data/) before proceeding with the steps below.

### 1\. How to Deactivate Your Account on Your PS4

 The first thing you should do is deactivate your account on your console. Doing this removes the ability to play your downloaded games on this console and helps avoid sign-in issues at other places where you use your account.

![Deactivate an account on the PS4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/deactivate-account-ps4.png)

Here's how to deactivate your account on your PS4:

1. Open the**Settings** menu on your PS4.
2. Select**Account Management** on the resulting screen.
3. Find**Activate as Your Primary PS4** and select it.
4. Select**Deactivate** followed by**Yes** to deactivate your account on this console.

 The**Activate** button will be grayed out because your account is already active on this PS4.

### 2\. How to Factory Reset Your PlayStation 4

 Now that you have deactivated your account, it's time to erase and reset your console to the factory defaults.

 Remember that a factory reset is not the first-line solution to software issues. If you're facing sign-in issues, you can[delete your PS4 user accounts](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-delete-ps4-users/) . If this helps, you won't need to reset your PS4.

 You can also use the Restore Default Settings option to only revert your saved settings to their default. This option won't wipe your PS4's hard drive and is much quicker than a factory reset.

![initialize ps4 setting to factory reset](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/factory-reset-ps4.png)

 Once you're certain that a factory reset is the way to go, follow the steps below to reset your console to the factory settings:

1. Open the**Settings** menu on your console.
2. Scroll all the way down until you see**Initialization** and then select it.
3. Select**Initialize PS4** . This removes everything that you've stored on your PS4.
4. Select**Full** on the following screen to reset your console completely.

 It'll take a while before your PS4 is fully reset. You can track the reset progress using the progress indicator on your screen.

 Once the reset is complete, your PS4 will boot to display the first-time setup guide. You have now successfully wiped all the data from your PS4.

## How to Factory Reset Your PS4 in Safe Mode

 If your PS4 is having trouble booting up, and you can't access the settings menu, there's still a way to reset your console.

 In safe mode, the PS4 boots up with only essential system software and drivers, bypassing any potentially problematic settings or applications that may be causing issues.

![initializing the ps4 in safe mode to create factory reset](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/reset-ps4-safe-mode.png)

Mahesh Makvana/MUO

To factory reset your PS4 in safe mode, follow the steps below:

1. [Turn your PS4 off](http://www.makeuseof.com/turn-ps4-off-with-without-controller/) completely.
2. Once you have turned your PS4 off, boot it into safe mode. To do this, press and hold down the**Power** button for about eight seconds until you hear a beep.
3. Let go of the**Power** button after the second beep sound.
4. Connect your controller to your PS4 using a USB cable. The wireless mode doesn't work in safe mode, so you need to use a cable to connect.
5. Select the**Initialize PS4** option using your controller.
6. Choose**Full** to initialize your console completely.

Your PS4 will now perform a factory reset.

## How to Reinstall the PS4's Software

 One way to reset your PS4 is by reinstalling the system firmware. In most cases, you don't need to do this, as the methods above should fully reset your console.

 Reinstalling the PS4 system software is only necessary if the issues you're facing aren't due to any settings or corrupt games, but the PS4 software system itself is corrupt.

 A corrupt software system can occur if the factory reset process is interrupted or if system updates are not installed correctly. In these cases, the issues won't go away despite resetting the console. But you can try installing the latest firmware version.

 To reinstall the system firmware, you will need a computer and a USB flash drive. You need to move the firmware software from your computer to a USB flash drive, which you will then connect to your PS4 to install the software.

### 1\. Preparing a USB Drive for a PS4 Software Reinstall

 Your flash drive should have at least 2GB of space to store the PS4 firmware file. You might have to format the USB drive, so make sure to[back up your USB drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-external-usb-back-up/) first. Once you're ready, follow the steps below:

1. Head over to the[PS4 firmware site](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps4/system-software/) .
2. Download the firmware file from the**Reinstall PS4 system software** section. This will be the full version of the software for your PlayStation 4.
3. [Format your USB flash drive](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/format-usb-drive/) in FAT32.
4. Create a folder named**PS4** on your flash drive.
5. Create another folder inside the**PS4** folder and name it**UPDATE** .
6. Move the PS4 firmware you downloaded over to this**UPDATE** folder.
7. Make sure the downloaded file uses**PS4UPDATE.PUP** as its name. If not, change the name to this one.

### 2\. Reinstalling the Firmware on Your PS4

 After you've got the USB drive ready, it's time to connect it to your PS4 and reinstall the software. Follow these steps:

![Reinstall software on the PS4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/reinstall-software-ps4.png)

Mahesh Makvana/MUO

1. Connect your flash drive to your PS4 console.
2. Boot your PS4 into safe mode by pressing the**Power** button until it beeps twice.
3. Select**Initialize PS4 (Reinstall System Software)** .
4. Choose**Update from USB Storage Device** followed by**OK** .
5. Wait for your console to reinstall the system software.

 When done, your PS4 should return to the factory settings with the stock firmware. If your PS4 doesn't recognize the software file, ensure you've used the proper folder names as advised above. If the software file is corrupt, you'll need to re-download it from the PlayStation website.

 Although PlayStation 4 issues are rare, if you ever come across one, resetting your PS4 should help fix the issue in most cases. You might also want to reset your PS4 when you're giving away your console. That way, you're sure that the next owner of your PS4 won't have access to your personal information.
