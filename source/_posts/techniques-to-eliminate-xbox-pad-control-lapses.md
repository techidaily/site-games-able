## Techniques to Eliminate Xbox Pad Control Lapses

 Xbox Wireless Controllers have been utilized for both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S generations of Xbox consoles. And while the design has changed over time, the base model of the wireless pad has remained the same. However, despite little alterations, Xbox Wireless Controllers are not without fault.

 Unfortunately, Xbox Wireless Controllers are subject to the most common issue with any gaming controller: stick drift. Luckily, if your Xbox Wireless Controller happens to be experiencing stick drift, there are a few methods you can use to troubleshoot and correct the issue. Let's take a look.

### Update Your Xbox Wireless Controller

 One of the easiest ways to see whether a system error from either your Xbox controller or console is causing the stick drift is to update your Xbox Wireless Controller.

 By updating your Xbox controller, you ensure it's running off the latest potential patches for issues and glitches released by Microsoft. This would highlight whether an issue beyond a physical problem is causing the stick drift.

## How to Physically Repair Xbox Wireless Controller Stick Drift

 If it doesn't seem like a software error is to blame for your controller's stick drift, there is likely a physical fault. In this scenario, it's worth double-checking your controller for obvious physical damage. If there is no apparent cause, the most likely ways to fix Xbox Wireless Controller stick drift physically are as follows:

### Repair Xbox Wireless Controller Stick Drift With Compressed Air

 One of the most common issues that may cause your Xbox Wireless Controller to have stick drift is the build-up of dirt within your controller, preventing an analog stick from functioning properly.

 Unfortunately, the easiest way to fix this issue is to purchase a can of compressed air so that you can clean the cavity the analog stick sits in and free up dirt that is potentially causing the issue.

![A photograph of a black Xbox One controller against a bright yellow background](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stock-for-air-1.jpg)

 Once you have a can of compressed air handy, you can attempt to fix the stick drift issues with your Xbox controller by following these steps:

* Ensure your Xbox Wireless Controller is turned off.
* Place the air tube for the compressed air can near the base of the analog stick, and start to spray compressed air.
* As the air hits the base and crevices of the analog stick, slowly move the stick around to free up any trapped dirt.

 While it may take multiple attempts, the compressed air should be able to dislodge any potential obstructions causing the stick drift issues with your Xbox controller.

### Fix Stick Drift by Taking Your Xbox Wireless Controller Apart

 If compressed air doesn't fix your stick drifting issues, you may have to dismantle your Xbox Wireless Controller. Unfortunately, dismantling your Xbox controller is quite fiddly and could potentially further damage the controller if done incorrectly.

 The process also voids any warranty for the controller, but if you want to attempt to replace your analog sticks or remove any blockages causing stick drift, you can dismantle your Xbox controller with these steps:

* Ensure the Xbox controller is off and remove the left and right corner grips. You may need to use a prying tool.

* Take the battery cover off the back of the Xbox controller and unscrew the hidden screw beneath the sticker with a T9 screwdriver.
* With the same screwdriver, move along the grips of the Xbox controller unscrewing the two screws from each side.

![A photograph of an Xbox One controller with its grips removed and highlighting the revealed screws](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/grip-screws.jpg)

* With all the screws removed, you can take the casing off your Xbox Wireless Controller to reveal the internal parts.

![A photograph of a dismantled Xbox One controller with the internal parts accessible](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/controller-dismantled.jpg)

 Now the internal parts of your Xbox Wireless Controller are accessible, you should be able to see whether there are any blockages interfering with the analog stick mechanism. If you want to replace the sticks altogether, simply pull each plastic cover off and replace them with your new analog sticks.

 You can also take the opportunity to[clean your Xbox Wireless Controller](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-xbox-one-controller/) . After all, a clean and well-maintained controller is less likely to develop faults in the first place and the internal parts are a nightmare for gathering dust and muck.

## Keep Your Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S Controllers Healthy

 Hopefully, by following the above steps, you can attempt to fix the stick drift affecting your Xbox Wireless Controller. If the issue persists, you may have to replace your controller altogether. But ideally, replacing your analog sticks is the most drastic thing you need to do to fix the issue.

 And just like fixing analog stick drift, if you experience any other issues with your Xbox Wireless Controller, there are a lot of other quick and simple fixes you can try before getting a replacement. This way, you can ensure your Xbox Wireless Controllers are well-maintained and ready to go.
