## 3\. How to Use Your Free Twitch Sub With Amazon Prime

 There are a few hoops to jump through to gain access to your monthly Twitch Subscription with Prime Gaming, but now that you’ve completed the above steps, you’re ready to claim it.

 To finally use your free sub, head to the[Twitch website](https://www.twitch.tv/) and open your favorite streamer's channel.

 At the bottom right of the stream window, you will see a box labeled**Subscribe** . Select that to bring up the subscription window.

![Subscribe Button Location on Twitch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/subscribe-button-location-on-twitch.jpg)

 A regular subscription to a Twitch channel costs $4.99/month, which you will see in the bottom right of the subscription window.

 If you have a free Prime Gaming sub, however, a checkbox labeled**Use Prime Sub** will be present. Check that box to redeem your free monthly Twitch subscription and select**Subscribe with Prime** to confirm.

![Use Prime Sub Button on Twitch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/use-prime-sub-button-on-twitch.jpg)

 The checkbox will only be available if Twitch subscriptions are allowed in your country, you have already activated Prime Gaming, the channel you are trying to subscribe to is a Twitch Affiliate or Partner, and you haven’t used your free subscription for the month.

 If any of these conditions aren’t met, the option won't be available to you.

 Once you have successfully used your Prime Gaming sub, you can view and[manage your Twitch subscriptions](https://www.makeuseof.com/manage-twitch-subscriptions/) on the website.

 Free things are always hard to pass up, and since subscriptions are what keep Twitch, and its streamers going, your one free sub every month with Prime is easily one of the most[important Twitch features that every user should know about](https://www.makeuseof.com/twitch-features-every-user-should-know/) .

 An Amazon Prime subscription not only provides you with many shows and movies to watch but also gives you the chance to support your favorite creators for free.

 Subscriptions build up, and you no doubt have a growing list of monthly payments to subscription services already. But at least with Amazon Prime, you can scratch one Twitch subscription fee off your list each month.
