## Early Access Wins - Get Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PS5 Now

 The PlayStation 5 has been available for many years now, but the very first limited-edition console is about to hit the market. And it’s not just any limited-edition console. It’s a Marvel's Spider-Man 2 limited-edition console.

 The Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5 console is undeniably cool and pretty much guaranteed to sell out at record speeds. It's already sold out at a few different establishments, but there are a couple of places where you can still get your hands on this elusive PS5.

## When Can I Get the Limited-Edition Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5?

 The Marvel's Spider-Man 2 console is hitting shelves on September 1st, 2023, just a couple of weeks before the game that inspired its awesome new look. But considering the hype for this limited-edition console, the chances are it could be sold out long before you get to your local store to pick it up.

 Like many limited-edition items, the golden rule is that if you really want it, you should preorder it. That way, you can sit back and play some video games on your Spider-Man-themed PS5 on release day instead of crying into a pint of Ben & Jerry’s.

## Where Can I Get the Limited-Edition Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PS5?

 You can find this limited-edition console at places like GameStop, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, or Target. If you’re from the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria, or Portugal, you can also preorder this fancy new PS5 directly from the PlayStation Direct.

 If you’ve never placed a preorder online, you can go to your local game supplier and preorder one in person. Otherwise, you can follow the process we’ve outlined below to figure out how to secure one from the comfort of your own home.
