## Remedying Launcher Malfunction in MC with Code 0X803F8001

 The Minecraft Launcher error 0x803f8001 usually occurs when users attempt to open the launcher or download and install it from Microsoft Store.

 Several factors may contribute to this; there could be an issue with your Microsoft Store account, you are not signed in with the account that has a Minecraft license, Microsoft Store cache, launcher installation, or the Microsoft Store itself could be corrupted. Likewise, not updating your operating system for a long time can cause the issue.

 If this error prevents you from running the game, here are some fixes you can try.

## 1\. Ensure You're Signed Into the Right Microsoft Account

 Make sure you are logged into the Microsoft Store with the same account that has the Minecraft license. Here is how to check that:

1. Type**"Microsoft Store"** into Windows Search and open the app.
2. Click on the**profile icon** in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. See the details of the account that is currently logged in.
4. If you are signed in with a different account, click**Sign out** to sign out of the Microsoft account. Then, sign in with the right account.  
![Click on Sign Out to Sign Out of the Microsoft Store Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/click-on-sign-out-to-sign-out-of-the-microsoft-store-account.jpg)

 If you're already logged into the Microsoft Store with the correct account, sign out once and sign back in again. This will feasibly resolve any account synchronization issues and glitches.

## 2\. Run the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 As the Microsoft Launcher and Microsoft Store are both UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps, the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter might provide a solution. The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter can fix various app issues, which fortunately includes this 0x803f8001 error.

Here is how to launch the troubleshooter:

1. Launch Settings to view the**System** tab.
2. Click the**Troubleshoot** and**Other trouble-shooters** navigation options in Settings.
3. Scroll down to Windows Store Apps, and click the**Run** button for that troubleshooter.  
![The Run button for the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-windows-store-apps-run-button.jpg)
4. The troubleshooter will open and scan for app issues. Apply any potential resolutions it suggests.

## 3\. Ensure the Windows Time and Date Is Correct

 One of the leading causes of Microsoft Store errors is incorrect time and date settings. When you launch a game, it connects to the game servers remotely. If the time and date aren't configured correctly, this can lead to miscommunication between the host and server, which can lead to the error in question.

 An independent advisor on the [Microsoft Community forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/date-and-time-issue-while-launching-rocket-league/e003f53d-1cac-409f-bbfd-843fb289a6fb) also recommends selecting the correct time and date format to avoid facing such issues. They recommend using the ISO 8601 time and date format, which starts with the year and continues with the month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

 Keeping that in mind, check the time and date in the bottom-right corner of your screen. If the date and time are correct but not in the format described above, refer to our guide on [how to change the date and time format in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-change-date-time-format/) and select the appropriate one.

## 4\. Reset the Microsoft Store and Minecraft Launcher via Settings

 The Settings app includes a**Reset** option for apps that erases app data when selected. As that option can fix apps that aren’t working right, it’s recommended that you reset data for both Microsoft Store and Minecraft Launcher.

You can reset your apps in Windows 11 like this:

1. Open Settings with its hotkey or from the start menu.
2. Select the**Apps** tab inside Settings.
3. Click**Apps & features** to view your PC’s app list.
4. Next, click the three-dot button for the Microsoft Store app.  
![The three-dot button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-three-dot-button.jpg)
5. Select**Advanced options** to bring up the**Reset** button.
6. Click the**Reset** option. Select**Reset** again on the confirmation prompt.  
![The Repair and Reset buttons](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-repair-and-reset-buttons.jpg)
7. Note that you can also select a**Repair** option that’s just above the**Reset** button. If resetting doesn’t do the trick, try selecting the**Repair** option for Microsoft Store.
8. Repeat the above steps for the Microsoft Launcher app.

## 5\. Reset the Microsoft Store Cache

 The Minecraft Launcher error 0x803f8001 might occur because of a corrupted Microsoft Store cache. As such, resetting the corrupted cache could be the fix you’re looking for. You can reset the Microsoft Store cache with wsreset.exe like this:

1. Bring up the Power User menu with the**Win** +**X** keyboard shortcut.
2. Open Run by selecting it on that menu.
3. Type**wsreset.exe** in the Open dialog box.  
![The wsreset Run command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-wsreset-command.jpg)
4. Click**OK** to reset Microsoft Store’s cache.

## 6\. Re-Register the Microsoft Store via an Elevated PowerShell

 Sometimes, reregistering the Microsoft Store using an Elevated Powershell does the trick. Here's how to do that:

1. First, open Windows’ search box and enter the keyword**PowerShell** there.
2. Select**Run as administrator** for the PowerShell search result to launch that app.  
![The Run as Administrator option for Windows PowerShell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/run-as-administrator-option-for-powershell.jpg)
3. [Copy and paste](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-copy-paste-methods/) this command into PowerShell and hit**Enter** to execute:  
`Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.WindowsStore | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" -Verbose}`
4. Then input this second command in the PowerShell window:  
`Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.WindowsStore | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" -Verbose}`
5. Press the**Enter** keyboard key to run the command.

## 7\. Reinstall the Microsoft Store

 You might need to fix a corrupted Microsoft Store installation to resolve error 0x803f8001\. Reinstalling Microsoft Store will likely fix such an issue. However, you can’t uninstall that app via Settings. To reinstall it, you’ll need to enter a couple of PowerShell commands like this:

1. [Open PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) as covered in steps one and two of resolution six.
2. To uninstall Microsoft Store, input this command and hit**Enter** :  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Remove-AppxPackage`
3. Restart Windows before reinstalling MS Store.
4. Bring up PowerShell, and input this command:  
`Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &ldquo;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&rdquo;}`
5. Press the**Enter** keyboard key to reinstall Microsoft Store.

## 8\. Reinstall the Minecraft Launcher App

 A lot of users have confirmed that reinstalling the Minecraft Launcher app fixes error 0x803f8001\. This is how you can reinstall the Minecraft Launcher:

1. Open the Settings window.
2. Select**Apps** \>**Apps & features** to open a software list.
3. Scroll down to Microsoft Launcher, and click the button with three dots on the right of that app.
4. Select the**Uninstall** option to remove Microsoft Launcher.  
![The Uninstall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-uninstall-option-for-apps.jpg)
5. Click the**Restart** Start menu option before reinstalling the app.
6. Go to the [Minecraft for Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/minecraft-for-windows/9NBLGGH2JHXJ) Store app page.
7. Press the**Get** button for the app.
8. Then click Minecraft Launcher’s**Play** option in Microsoft Store.

## 9\. Install the Minecraft Launcher From the Microsoft Store

 Do you use the Minecraft Launcher you downloaded from the Minecraft website? If you do, uninstall the launcher using one of the [ways to uninstall apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) . Then, install it from the Microsoft Store.

 Several users have reported in a thread within the [Microsoft Community forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/when-i-try-to-launch-minecraft-launcher-i-get/dbb2b0aa-f68a-411c-8a9a-662499c8472f) that they have been able to fix the issue by doing this. Therefore, give it a shot and see if it fixes the problem.

## 10\. Repair Any Corrupted System Files

 There’s a possibility that corrupted system file dependencies for the Microsoft Store are causing an error 0x803f8001\. Therefore, running a System File Checker (SFC) scan via the Command Prompt to repair files could be a potential error 0x803f8001 solution for some users.

 Before running the SFC scan, it's a good idea to run a DISM scan beforehand. The DISM scan will fix any errors related to the SFC tool, so it's good to double-check that the SFC tool is operating properly before performing a scan.

## 11\. Update Windows
