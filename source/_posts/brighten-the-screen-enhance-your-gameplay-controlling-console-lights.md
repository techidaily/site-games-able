## How to Adjust the Brightness of Your Xbox Console Light

 In addition to the controller’s light, Xbox also allows you to adjust the brightness of the power button light on its console device. The default brightness for the console light is also set to full. The steps to achieve this are similar to adjusting the controller’s light:

1. Go to **Settings > General > TV & display options > Night Mode** .
2. Under**Preferences** , select**Power button brightness** and press**A** .  
![Xbox power button brightness setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-power-button-brightness-setting-1.jpeg)
3. Select and check the checkbox next to**Customize brightness** . Doing so highlights the slider for adjusting the console light’s brightness. Unlike the controller light, which has seven different brightness levels, there are only three brightness options for the console’s light. You can either completely turn it off, keep it at a 50% brightness level or increase the brightness to a full 100%.  
![Xbox customize power button brightness setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-customize-power-button-brightness-setting-2.jpeg)
4. Slide the slider left and right using the left thumbstick and leave it on the brightness level that you prefer. Exit the settings menu once you’ve adjusted the brightness according to your liking.

 With this, you've successfully adjusted your Xbox controller and console light's brightness.

## Enjoy a More Personalized Experience With Your Xbox Controller

 Customizing the brightness of your Xbox controller and console light allows you to tailor your gaming setup to your personal preferences. The steps to do this are easy, and it takes only a few seconds to increase or decrease the light intensity to your liking.

 Although the options for brightness adjustment for the controller light are plenty, hopefully we can see more of a variation when it comes to the Xbox console light.
