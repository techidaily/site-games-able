## Gearhead Guidance: Which Input Device Makes the Best Driver?

 The racing game genre is unique in its workings, environments, and depictions of powerful motor vehicles. It’s impressive to see how the typically complex and demanding mechanics of race car driving have been packaged in popular racing titles.

 These games allow players to control powerful and stunning vehicles with a controller. However, does this option provide the best experience compared to a racing wheel? Let’s find out.

## Controller vs. Racing Wheel: Factors to Consider

 A lot goes into making an excellent racing experience on a PC, console, or arcade machine. One factor developers often consider is how users can control the vehicles.

 A controller is a more popular and readily available option. However, racing wheels and the rigs surrounding them are no longer confined to fancy arcades and have become more readily available.

 To this end, here are some key points you should consider when deciding which of the two to purchase.

### 1\. Input Precision

![An F1-styled racing wheel with extra controls attached to a rig](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/racing-rig.jpg)

 A successful race boils down to each split-second decision a driver makes. Some racing titles do a great job of simulating this, providing the hair-raising experience of a fierce race for players to enjoy.

 However, this level of realism means a user needs to consider how precise their inputs will be. One false move and your car could collide with the competition, spin out, or stall, depending on how difficult the race is.

 Controllers allow racers to guide their cars, brake, drift, and more at just the click of a button. However, the analog sticks and D-Pad buttons only provide limited movement, and a swift turn could be the difference between a win and a loss.

 A racing wheel, however, emulates the operation of an actual steering wheel. Most modern racing titles like F1 2023 and Assetto Corsa are racing wheel-compatible and allow realistic vehicle control.

 An incredibly responsive racing wheel allows players to perform complex maneuvers that require precise input when paired with pedals and a comfortable seat.

 However, not all steering wheels allow the same level of control. This is an important factor to consider when[choosing a steering wheel for your Sim Racing setup](https://www.makeuseof.com/sim-racing-setup-steering-wheel/) . All things being equal, controllers are satisfactory for casual play. As such, popular titles like Forza Horizon 5 make the most of modern controllers with optimized input schemes.

 Controllers also allow for freedom of button customization. Users can decide what each button does and further personalize their racing experience by doing so.

 Ultimately, you should use a racing wheel for better input precision and control as a veteran player. However, a controller would suffice if you are new to racing games and just looking for a fun pastime.

### 2\. Complexity

![A car drifting around a sharp bend](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-car-drifting-1.jpg)

 Professional drivers train to improve their hand-eye coordination, response time, and reflexes to produce the best performance. They must also familiarize themselves with their car controls before a big race.

 However, all this might seem like information overload to someone new to racing and racing games. This is why most modern games start players off with simple control schemes.

 Some newbie-friendly mechanics include auto-drifting, auto-acceleration, and more. These mechanics usually come preselected for a controller. However, hooking up a racing wheel often tells the system you know what you are doing. It will require better hand-eye coordination and, in some cases, actual driving experience.

 A new player can’t just hop on a racing wheel and expect to be good overnight. It’s hard to learn and even harder to master. F1 2022 is a game title that accurately portrays this mechanic’s difficulty.

 It’s one of the[games that really put you behind the wheel](https://www.makeuseof.com/realistic-sim-racing-games/) for a reason. Everything from well-executed turns to timely pit stops could either guide you to victory or lead to your defeat. Consequently, using a racing wheel over a controller or vice versa could make a difference in such a game.

 So, consider your skill level when shopping for either a racing wheel or a controller. Do you have sharp reflexes and excellent coordination? If so, you could do great things with a racing wheel. However, you would benefit from a controller if you’re a casual gamer who intends to keep things simple.

### 3\. Feedback

 Racers behind the wheel get to feel the wind fighting against them, the gentle rumble of their engine, and the resistance of the road at every turn. Simply put, feedback is an essential part of the racing experience. It helps players and their vehicles work together toward victory, and its importance cannot be overstated.

 In this same vein, modern racing games can’t deliver an immersive experience without some haptic assistance. Thankfully, most modern controllers are equipped with vibrational feedback. The PS5 controller, in particular, has reactive haptic feedback.

 The back paddles can mimic the resistance of an accelerator, and the controller itself can vibrate when your car is hit or impeded by an obstacle on the road. As impressive as that sounds, racing wheels take haptic feedback to a higher level with force feedback.

 The racing wheels that are force feedback-compatible come with motors connected to the wheel via a belt. These motors work with the game engine to accurately replicate the feel of driving. Force feedback captures the harrowing bumps and close calls of tight races and sends it through your wheel to your hand.

 Exciting as this is, not all racing wheels are this responsive. If you're[considering whether buying a racing wheel is worth it](https://www.makeuseof.com/buying-racing-wheel-worth-it/) , you should take into account force feedback compatibility.

### 4\. Ergonomics

![gamers behind the wheel at a racing arcade](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/joel-stylis-npx1pz-h2mm-unsplash.jpg)

 The ergonomics of a race car are designed to protect the driver and provide them with optimal positioning for long races. While ergonomics in gaming is not a matter of life and death, it contributes considerably to the overall playthrough experience.

 Controllers are small and conveniently held in many positions. Because of this, players can kick back and relax as they play with a controller in hand. They are also designed to be held for extended periods and only require the occasional finger stretch depending on how tightly you like to hold your controller.

 Racing wheels, on the other hand, are a different story. The wheels in an arcade are designed around an entire rig that includes a driving seat, pedals, and a gear stick. Racing wheels can be bought in a bundle with a rig but are typically sold separately. This means it is left to the user to decide how to prop up their racing wheel.

 You will require a good chair and a desk with adjustable height for the best experience. However, you will require a racing rig for the best results. Ultimately, you’ll do well to remember that racing wheels are not the type of equipment you can conveniently place on your lap when you want to play.

 Consequently, a controller will be a better option if you are looking for an input system that lets you kick back and get comfortable while playing.

### 5\. Compatibility

 While purchasing a controller or a racing wheel is fine, you must know if they will work on your gaming platform.

 PC as a platform is widely compatible with most input styles. Plus, Steam makes this possible thanks to the controller settings menu that lets you customize what you use to play your favorite games.

![A picture of the Steam settings menu overlayed on the Steam app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/controller-settings.jpg)

 The same cannot be said of the Xbox Series X|S and the PS5 consoles. They only work with a short list of wheels specifically designed for console compatibility. While your options are small with a console, they certainly aren’t overly limited. However, you must thoroughly research before choosing a particular steering wheel for your racing rig.

 Controllers, conversely, work well on most—if not all—gaming platforms and are typically plug-and-play.

## Controller vs. Racing Wheel: Which Is the Right Choice?

![Man thinking while sitting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-ariel-paredes-2218208.jpg)

 Both a controller and a racing wheel can provide an amazing playing experience—limited by some of the factors we discussed above. Upon closer inspection, you have to agree that a racing wheel is the better option for more immersive gameplay.

 At first, a racing wheel may be difficult to learn, but the skill ceiling is much higher than a controller. So, get a racing wheel if you want to push the limits of what can be done in your racing game of choice. However, if you’re constrained by a budget and are more of a casual gamer, the controller is the way to go.

## Clear the Finish Line

 Not every controller or racing wheel is for every gamer. Each person is unique in their playstyle and should have a clear idea of what they are looking for in a controller or wheel.

 To discover this for yourself, try creating a list of features that you can compare to available models of controllers and racing wheels while factoring in what was discussed above. It might seem like a lot of trouble initially, but getting that competitive edge you desire will be worth it.
