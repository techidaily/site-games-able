## 1\. Update Your Xbox Wireless Controller on PC

 While you may frequently[update your Xbox Wireless Controller on your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-xbox-one-and-series-controllers/) , you can also update your controller through your PC. In instances where your controller won't connect to your PC, installing a PC Xbox Wireless Controller update can fix the issue.

 To update your Xbox Wireless Controller on your Windows PC, you need to install the Xbox Accessories application from the[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xbox-accessories/9NBLGGH30XJ3?hl=en-us&gl=US&rtc=1) . Once the Xbox Accessories app is installed on your PC, update your controller by following these steps:

* Ensure your Xbox Wireless Controller is plugged into your PC via a USB cable.
* Open the Xbox Accessories app on your PC.
* Select**More options** .

* If an update is available, select**Update now** .

![A screenshot of the updating screen for an Xbox Wireless Controller](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3198.jpg)

 However, even if an update is unavailable, selecting**No update available** will still force the app to check your controller's firmware and install any inessential changes. Doing so may allow your Xbox Wireless Controller to connect to your PC or iron out any errant firmware causing the issue.

## 2\. Re-Pair Your Xbox Controller to Your PC

 While running a PC controller update can rectify your Xbox Wireless Controller not connecting to your PC, the method doesn't work if the Xbox Accessories app fails to pick up your controller, even through a USB. Moreover, it's not guaranteed that performing a controller update on a PC will fix your problem.

 However, if you have connected your Xbox Wireless Controller to your PC before, you can potentially fix connectivity issues by re-pairing your controller. But if you haven't connected your devices before, there are plenty of[methods for connecting any Xbox controller to your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/) .

 So, to un-pair and re-pair your Xbox Wireless Controller and fix connectivity problems, follow these steps:

* Open**Settings** on your Windows PC.
* From the**Home** screen, select**Devices** .
* Under**Bluetooth & other devices** , select**Xbox Wireless Controller** .
* Select**Remove device** .

![A screenshot of a paired Xbox Wireless Controller on a Windows PC with the option to Remove Device highlighted](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3219.jpg)

 From here, you will need to re-pair your Xbox Wireless Controller to your PC. To do this follow these steps:

* Hold the**Pair button** down on your Xbox Wireless Controller for three seconds.
* Under**Bluetooth & other devices** on your PC, select**Add Bluetooth or other device** .
* Choose**Bluetooth** , and select**Xbox Wireless Controller** as soon as it becomes available.

![A screenshot of the Add A Device option available through the Bluetooth settings of a Windows PC](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3200.jpg)

 If done correctly, your PC will then re-pair with your Xbox Wireless Controller over Bluetooth and should remain connected for the foreseeable future.

## 3\. Run the Windows Bluetooth Troubleshooter

 If you have attempted updating and re-pairing your controller to your PC, and it still won't connect, you can try troubleshooting the Bluetooth features on your Windows PC. This way, if Bluetooth errors are causing your connectivity issues, you should be able to rectify the problem.

 Luckily, Windows PCs come with a specific Bluetooth troubleshooting option that can detect any issues for you. To run the Windows Bluetooth troubleshooter and fix Bluetooth issues with your Xbox Wireless Controller, follow these steps:

* Press the Windows**Start button** to open the search bar, and type**Bluetooth** .
* From the results, select**Find and fix problems with Bluetooth devices** .
* A pop-up for the troubleshooter will then appear on your screen. Select**Next** to continue.

 Once completed, the Bluetooth troubleshooter will inform you of any issues that have been detected and amended. If any issues have been found and fixed, you should try to reconnect your Xbox Wireless Controller over Bluetooth to see if your connectivity issues are also fixed.

## 4\. Restart Your Xbox Wireless Controller and PC

 Even if none of the above methods have helped your Xbox Wireless Controller connect to your PC, you can still try restarting your PC and controller. This may sound like a simple fix, but resetting your devices can often be exactly what's needed to fix tech issues.

 However, while it may be a simple process to reset your PC, resetting your Xbox Wireless Controller is less common. So, to reset your Windows PC and Xbox Wireless Controller, follow these steps:

* To restart your Windows PC, press the**Start** button to access the options under**Power** and select**Restart** .
* To restart your Xbox Wireless Controller, hold down the**Xbox button** for around 6 seconds. Once your controller turns off, wait a moment and press the**Xbox button** again to restart your controller.

 With your PC and Xbox Wireless Controller up and running after a restart, you should try to connect your controller to your PC again.

 If your Xbox Wireless Controller still won't connect to your PC, a fault with your hardware may be the cause. In this case, you should see if other devices can connect to your PC. If they can, your controller is likely to blame. Luckily, you can still get a faulty Xbox Wireless Controller replaced through[the official Microsoft site](https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/hardware-network/controller/controller-warranty) .
