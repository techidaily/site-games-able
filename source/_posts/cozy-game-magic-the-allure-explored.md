## What Are Cozy Games?

![cozy game tag on steam](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cozy-game-tag-on-steam.jpg)

 Rather than being a strict genre with set requirements, "cozy" is a broad descriptor that applies to relaxing, casual, and usually wholesome games. These games aren't limited to one type of genre, but farm simulators are a particularly popular type of cozy game.

 In 2024, you'll find cozy MMOs, puzzle games, adventure games, and simulation games. The["cozy" tag on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Cozy/) is filled with hundreds of games across genres. These games are often accompanied by relaxing soundtracks that contribute to the overall cozy vibe of the titles.

 Some of the most popular cozy games are Stardew Valley, Spirtfarer (which we included on our list of[stress-free games](https://www.makeuseof.com/relaxing-games-to-improve-mental-health/) ), Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Unpacking, but there are many more out there. One of my recent favorites is a title called Minami Lane, which lets you manage and build a street where you try to meet goals like attracting cats or making residents happy.

 While cozy games do have room for some more advanced mechanics and simple combat, the main differentiator is the ability for players to go at their own pace and have a relaxing time. The stakes are generally low compared to the focus needed in games like FPS titles and competitive multiplayer games.

 Cozy games are also not exclusive to specific consoles or platforms, but there are a large number of these titles on mobile and the Nintendo Switch. There are a variety of[relaxing mobile games](https://www.makeuseof.com/relaxing-mobile-games/) that you can enjoy. I personally play cozy games across PC, mobile, and consoles.

## The Rise of Cozy Games

![stardew valley farm screenshot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stardew-valley-farm-screenshot.jpg)

 Cozy games have been around for a long time, which players of the first Harvest Moon games and even the early iterations of The Sims can attest to. However, there has been a surge in the category following the success of Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

 Stardew Valley was released in 2016 and became an indie darling. While this inspired a range of other farming simulators, Animal Crossing: New Horizons was a major factor in the surge of current cozy games thanks to its success during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 With people stuck at home during a stressful period, Animal Crossing: New Horizons became a relaxing, low-stakes distraction for many people. Considering it was a Nintendo Switch exclusive, its ability to attract such a large audience was particularly impressive.

 In 2024, the category of games continues to succeed. Newer cozy games include Fae Farm, Palia, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and My Time at Sandrock.

## Why Are Cozy Games So Popular?

 I would argue that cozy games are so popular because of their ability to relax players and provide wholesome, escapist adventures. While many studies look at the negative effects of gaming on mental health, there are also some positive benefits.

 A[review published in JMIR Ment Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406113/) found that a variety of game genres helped reduce stress and anxiety across age groups:

> " In addition to exergames and casual video games, other genres of commercial off-the-shelf games helped to reduce stress and anxiety."

 These effects were particularly prevalent during the COVID-19 lockdowns when many people were socially isolated. While lockdowns have ended, cozy games continue to provide relaxing escapism when facing the stressors of modern life.

 I personally find cozy games very relaxing when I try to de-stress from work. The casual routine of the games also helps me self-regulate when I'm overstimulated by daily stressors. While I can't speak for everyone, anecdotally, I can say that cozy games are an important way for some people to de-stress.

 The number of cozy games continues to grow, with some games increasingly marketing themselves under the cozy term. Hopefully, the category of games continues to flourish thanks to its relaxing approach to gameplay.
