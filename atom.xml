    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Beam-of-Brilliance-Choose-Broad-Bold-Framing-for-Games"><a href="#Beam-of-Brilliance-Choose-Broad-Bold-Framing-for-Games" class="headerlink" title="Beam of Brilliance: Choose Broad, Bold Framing for Games"></a>Beam of Brilliance: Choose Broad, Bold Framing for Games</h2><p> If you’re a gamer of a certain age, you likely have fond memories of your local arcade. Clutching your coins, challenging locals, and the rush of a crowd watching you succeed: the arcade delivered an experience unlike any other.</p><p> The good news is modern technology makes it possible to not only replicate those golden years, but make the experience of playing via an arcade even better than you remember. The secret to that sauce is a frontend designed with arcade play in mind, and it’s hard to beat Big Box, courtesy of LaunchBox—here’s why.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets"><a href="#What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets" class="headerlink" title="What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?"></a>What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?</h2><p> Think about the components needed to operate an arcade cabinet. You at least need a joystick with a set of buttons, speakers, a monitor, a cabinet, and a device to run the whole thing, like a desktop. But how do you navigate the system once it’s set up? That’s where frontend software comes in.</p><p> Frontend software finds the games installed on your device, displays them in an easy-to-navigate library, and lets you select each game via your arcade cabinet’s controls alone. It’s the same principle behind the software that allows you to explore your library on a PS5 or via the Steam client on your desktop using a gaming controller.</p><p> A frontend also adds order to the chaos that is your ROM collection. You want to know what you’re going to be playing before you select it. So you need to add key metadata for each game, like the title, platform, thumbnail art, etc., to make everything look nice and tidy.</p><p> This can take days of work alone. But not with Big Box. Let’s dig a bit deeper and learn why a premium subscription to LaunchBox is worth the cost of admission alone for Big Box if you’re setting up your own arcade cabinet.</p><h2 id="1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata"><a href="#1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata" class="headerlink" title="1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata"></a>1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata</h2><p> Whether you’ve tackled big projects, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >building a portable retro gaming console using a Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or added a few classic arcade games to your work desktop, you know how painful it is to organize your collection. You are forced to add in every bit of metadata manually in most cases, including hunting down individual bits of media for each game, like a bezel, screenshot, video, and so on.</p><p> It’s painful work, and for those with massive collections, you’ll be more prone to not organize anything. Don’t do that! Organize now to make it easier to find precisely what you want to play, and you’ll use it more frequently than not, guaranteed.</p><p> Leveraging the power of Big Box via EmuMovies automatically finds all of the metadata for each game automatically, allows you to essentially set it and forget it! But you’ll need to be a premium member of both, then link your EmuMovies account to LaunchBox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/configure-emumovies-1.jpg"                      alt="Linking EmuMovies and Launchbox"                ></p><p> Once linked, everything from bezels and marquees to videos, screenshots, and even descriptions about each game will populate each game’s entry. So when you’re searching through your library in Big Box, you get a vibrant, informative listing about each game so you know what you’re about to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/import-flyers-bezels-etc.jpg"                      alt="Importing metadata into Launchbox"                ></p><p> This saves days’ worth of work alone, and means <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/launchbox-premium-worth-buying/" >LaunchBox Premium is worth the cost of admission <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> highly recommend getting a lifetime subscription to both LaunchBox and EmuMovies. You’re looking at $135 for both licenses as of July 2023.</p><p> But in terms of ease-of-use and the time saved alone, it’s going to be money well spent. Especially if you want your arcade cabinet to grow with you as you keep adding games via Steam or another source.</p><h2 id="2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library"><a href="#2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library" class="headerlink" title="2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library"></a>2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library</h2><p> Want to know the importance of context? Look at this listing below as an example. If I had not used EmuMovies as I discussed a moment ago, this cabinet would be nothing but a list of games.</p><p> But because I imported the metadata a moment ago, now this listing has a description, trailer, a banner image, and even music from the game. It’s as informative as a listing of an episode or film on your favorite streaming service, making it easy to choose the game you want to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/emu-movies-front-page.jpg"                      alt="Game page in EmuMovies"                ></p><p> If you’re already familiar with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-launchbox-how-it-works/" >LaunchBox and how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you already know that you can add custom filters for your games, like the number of players per game or by genre. The filters you create in LaunchBox also appear in Big Box, making it easy to find the right game for the occasion.</p><h2 id="3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls"><a href="#3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls" class="headerlink" title="3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls"></a>3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls</h2><p> If you’re building your arcade cabinet for the first time, you’re probably wondering how the heck you’re going to be able to exit a game or adjust the volume. You may think you need dedicated buttons, and while that’s one route, Big Box solves this problem by allowing you to hotkey certain tasks.</p><p> For example, when I want to exit a game, I tap my<strong>Player 1 Start button</strong> and<strong>A button</strong> simultaneously twice to activate the<strong>Close the Active Window</strong> value, which exits my game. I can also do a different button combination for the volume control, among other functions.</p><h2 id="4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees"><a href="#4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees" class="headerlink" title="4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees"></a>4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees</h2><p> When you populate your library with metadata via EmuMovies, you probably notice that a marquee file is always downloaded. These files are used with a second screen, displayed as a marquee like a traditional arcade cabinet.</p><p> Once you have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-dual-monitors/" >set up dual monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your arcade system, go into Big Box then select<strong>Options &gt; General &gt; Marquee Screen &gt; Screen 2</strong> . Now, whenever you highlight a game in Big Box, your second screen will display the marquee for that particular game, usually reflective of the cabinet it was in during its heyday. It’s a nice touch that goes a long way toward making your cabinet feel authentic yet new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/second-screen-marquee-big-box.jpg"                      alt="Example of a second screen marquee in BigBox"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Unbroken Software LLC&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1gBLJ2IZJI" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell"><a href="#5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell"></a>5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell</h2><p> You don’t want to have to use a mouse to open Big Box every time your start the device running your cabinet. It’s preferable if you can dive right into your arcade cabinet’s frontend with as few steps as possible. Fortunately, Big Box makes it happen if your arcade cabinet is powered by Windows.</p><p> First, be sure that the device powering your arcade cabinet automatically logs into your account. For example, there are a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/automatically-sign-user-in-windows-10/" >ways to automatically sign into your account in Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Whatever operating system you are using, be sure it automatically logs in every time the device starts.</p><p> Next, start Big Box from LaunchBox. Then, go to <strong>System &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Enable Using Big Box as the Windows Shell &gt; Yes.</strong> The next time you reboot your device, Big Box will replace the Windows shell. If you need to get into Windows, you can still close Big Box via the Task Manager to gain access to Windows again.</p><h2 id="Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends"><a href="#Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends" class="headerlink" title="Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends"></a>Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends</h2><p> The amount of time and frustration saved alone is worth the cost of admission for LaunchBox and EmuMovies. It’s layered tidily in Big Box, making navigating your library of games via arcade controls so easy, you’ll wonder why other frontends are so complicated. Give it a shot, and you’ll become one of the converted.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-vivo-y100-by-drfone-android/"><u>10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Vivo Y100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-powered-narrative-building-for-games/"><u>AI-Powered Narrative Building for Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-realme-gt-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Realme GT 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/baldurs-gate-3-hardware-requirements-download-platforms-dlcs-and-more/"><u>Baldur's Gate 3: Hardware Requirements, Download Platforms, DLCs, and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-vlcs-screen-recording-capabilities/"><u>[New] VLC's Screen Recording Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/evolve-your-online-presence-move-beyond-fb/"><u>Evolve Your Online Presence, Move Beyond FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-clues-to-crack-virtual-crime-scenes/"><u>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amp-up-arcade-vibes-with-enlarged-frontend-frames/"><u>Amp Up Arcade Vibes with Enlarged Frontend Frames!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/affordable-gaming-delights-for-your-switch-console/"><u>Affordable Gaming Delights for Your Switch Console</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-game-hits-without-an-internet-connection-ios/"><u>Best Game Hits Without an Internet Connection (iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-crash-landings-fixing-windows-based-epic-games-problems/"><u>Avoid Crash Landings: Fixing Windows-Based Epic Games Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-streaming-showdown-face-off-between-obs-and-shadowtoolkit/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Streaming Showdown  Face Off Between OBS & ShadowToolKit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-you-getting-your-moneys-worth-from-ea-play/"><u>Are You Getting Your Money's Worth From EA Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-these-6-pitfalls-with-intels-upcoming-chips/"><u>Avoid These 6 Pitfalls with Intel's Upcoming Chips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Avoiding-Scams-on-the-Quest-for-Starfield-Access"><a href="#Avoiding-Scams-on-the-Quest-for-Starfield-Access" class="headerlink" title="Avoiding Scams on the Quest for Starfield Access"></a>Avoiding Scams on the Quest for Starfield Access</h2><p> The long wait for Starfield is almost over, and Bethesda’s open-world RPG is landing on the shelves of your local games store on September 6th, 2023. But if you just can’t wait until then, there is a way you can get your hands on Starfield early.</p><p> While it’s no secret that using the following method will allow you to play Starfield five days ahead of its official release date, there is a chance you might not have heard about it yet. So if you want to know how to get Starfield early, keep reading.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Starfield"><a href="#What-Is-Starfield" class="headerlink" title="What Is Starfield?"></a>What Is Starfield?</h2><p> Starfield needs no introduction for many of you. But just in case you have been living under a rock for the past few weeks or months, Starfield is one of the most highly anticipated video game releases for 2023.</p><p> To say it looks incredible is a bit of an understatement. If you thought open-world games were amazing, Starfield is more of an open-universe adventure with over one thousand unique planets to explore throughout the galaxy.</p><p> Starfield was originally scheduled for release in 2022, but after being delayed for over a year, it is finally coming to Xbox Series consoles and Windows-based PCs on the 6th of September. If you, like many other Starfield fans, just can’t wait until then, how does September 1st sound?</p><h2 id="Where-to-Get-Starfield-Early"><a href="#Where-to-Get-Starfield-Early" class="headerlink" title="Where to Get Starfield Early"></a>Where to Get Starfield Early</h2><p> You can get your hands on Starfield five days early, but it will cost you. The only way you can get it before the original release date is to preorder a special edition. You do have options, though, which is nice.</p><p> To get early access to Starfield, you have to purchase one of the following editions of the game:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/starfield-premium-edition/9NLGBHLSWXM8/0017" >Starfield Premium Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —digital only ($99.99).</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/starfield-premium-edition-upgrade/9PB4ZWV7S2MG/0017" >Starfield Premium Edition Upgrade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($34.99).</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/get-starfield" >Starfield Constellation Edition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($299.99).</li></ol><p> Each of the above offers is expensive, but they come with lots of extra bells and whistles. Sadly, the Constellation Edition is a little harder to find as preorders sold out in most places almost immediately after it was announced, but both the Premium Edition and Premium Edition Upgrade are still available on the Xbox website.</p><p> One thing to note before making your purchase is that Starfield is available on Game Pass day one. So if you have that, the Premium Edition Upgrade could be the way to go for you. That way, you can get the game early, get the story expansion, skins, and other benefits, while still being able to enjoy the game on Game Pass.

But as disappointing as it is when a game gets delayed, it just means that the final product you play in the end is going to be much better, and that’s never a bad thing.</p><p> Unfortunately, you’re not going to be able to get your hands on Starfield months or even weeks in advance, but five days early is certainly better than nothing. And the bragging rights alone make preordering the premium editions of this highly anticipated title well worth the price.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-art-of-blending-music-into-your-ig-visuals/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Art of Blending Music Into Your IG Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/galactic-grandeur-in-hd-optimal-websites-featuring-the-sky/"><u>Galactic Grandeur in HD  Optimal Websites Featuring the Sky</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-you-getting-your-moneys-worth-from-ea-play/"><u>Are You Getting Your Money's Worth From EA Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-the-new-dawn-of-creativity-spotlight-on-six-visionary-nftos-for-2024/"><u>[New] The New Dawn of Creativity  Spotlight on Six Visionary NFTOs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-powered-narrative-building-for-games/"><u>AI-Powered Narrative Building for Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/unleash-creativity-10-top-rated-free-mac-art-software/"><u>Unleash Creativity  10 Top-Rated, FREE Mac Art Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/baldurs-gate-3-for-m1m2-using-crossover-on-mac/"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 for M1/M2: Using Crossover on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/affordable-highview-monitor-27m2v-pixels/"><u>Affordable HighView Monitor, 27M2V Pixels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-lock-screen-settings-how-to-enable-and-disable-on-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Lock Screen Settings How to Enable and Disable on Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/android-retro-replaying-classic-pokemon-adventures/"><u>Android Retro: Replaying Classic Pokemon Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-mac-devices-changing-gamers-landscape/"><u>Are Mac Devices Changing Gamers’ Landscape?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-nokia-xr21-without-the-home-button-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Reset Nokia XR21 Without the Home Button | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-abnormal-arrival-annoyance-lol-style/"><u>Avoid Abnormal Arrival Annoyance, LoL Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-0xa00f429f-camera-error-on-windows-devices/"><u>Troubleshooting 0xA00F429F Camera Error on Windows Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-clues-to-crack-virtual-crime-scenes/"><u>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-aaa-game-publishers-just-getting-too-big-podcast/"><u>Are AAA Game Publishers Just Getting Too Big?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Amplify-Gameplay-Navigating-the-World-of-FPS-in-Android-Games"><a href="#Amplify-Gameplay-Navigating-the-World-of-FPS-in-Android-Games" class="headerlink" title="Amplify Gameplay: Navigating the World of FPS in Android Games"></a>Amplify Gameplay: Navigating the World of FPS in Android Games</h2><p> Whether you’re a casual gamer or a competitive one, squeezing the most performance out of your device never hurts. One of the easiest ways to check if you’re having a smooth gaming experience is to keep an eye out on the FPS counter.</p><p> There are plenty of ways you can track the frame rate in games on a PC, but your options become sparse when it comes to gaming on your phone. Read on to find out just how you can check the frames per second in games on an Android phone or tablet.</p><h2 id="What-Is-an-FPS-Counter"><a href="#What-Is-an-FPS-Counter" class="headerlink" title="What Is an FPS Counter?"></a>What Is an FPS Counter?</h2><p> The term <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-fps-meaning/" >FPS has multiple meanings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but “frames per second” specifically is a great way to indicate how optimally and smoothly your games are running. An FPS counter is a simple tool that displays the number of frames your device is rendering every second.</p><p> These calculations are in real-time and are useful for benchmarks, diagnosing issues, or just having peace of mind. The general formula dictates the more frames per second you have, the better your gaming experience is going to be.</p><p> Enabling this feature on a computer is easy and accessible, given just how many good <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fps-counter-apps-windows-11/" >FPS counter apps for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> there are. For Android, on the other hand, your options are limited and quite finicky.</p><h2 id="1-Track-FPS-Using-Your-Default-Game-Booster-App"><a href="#1-Track-FPS-Using-Your-Default-Game-Booster-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Track FPS Using Your Default Game Booster App"></a>1. Track FPS Using Your Default Game Booster App</h2><p> Most performance-centric Android phones have their own game booster app or plugin of some kind. For Poco it’s the Game Turbo service, for ROG Phones it’s called the X Mode, and there’s also a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gaming-mode-on-oneplus-phones/" >gaming mode for OnePlus devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Usually, the easiest way to enable the gaming mode on your phone is to launch a game that your game booster plugin supports, and you should automatically see a heads-up notification prompting you to enable or tamper with a few options. If not, look for a separate Games app in your app drawer and make sure your favorite games are added to the list.</p><p>To enable the FPS counter on a OnePlus phone for example:</p><ol><li>Launch any game you wish to play, and you should see a heads-up notification indicating that you can use the gaming mode features for this game.</li><li>Swipe down from either the top-left or top-right corner of your screen and a menu with loads of features should pop up.</li><li>Scroll down through the options and tap on<strong>System Status</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fps-counter-on-android-1a.jpg"                      alt="OnePlus Gaming Mode displaying FPS"                ></p><p> This should bring up a sticky FPS counter while you’re playing your game. Depending on your phone, you might even be able to peep into other details like your CPU and GPU usage as well.</p><h2 id="2-Track-the-Frame-Rate-Using-a-Third-Party-App"><a href="#2-Track-the-Frame-Rate-Using-a-Third-Party-App" class="headerlink" title="2. Track the Frame Rate Using a Third Party App"></a>2. Track the Frame Rate Using a Third Party App</h2><p> The method above should suffice for most gaming-centric phones from manufacturers like OnePlus, Xiaomi, ROG, and even Google. Unfortunately, not all phones come preloaded with a gaming mode.</p><p> There are a couple of third-party apps on the Play Store that claim to do the job for you. However, most of the apps we tested only report your screen’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/frame-rate-vs-refresh-rate-difference/" >refresh rate as opposed to the actual frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> your GPU is rendering. We were able to find one free app that was decently accurate at displaying the in-game FPS: FPS Counter &amp; Screen Recorder.</p><ol><li>Download the <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2028195/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.running.fpsmeter" >FPS Counter app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Play Store and launch it.</li><li>Enable the<strong>FPS Meter</strong> toggle and when prompted, tap on<strong>Start Now</strong> to allow the app to record and cast your screen.</li><li>Launch any game you like, and you should now see an FPS counter on your screen.</li><li>Once you’re done playing, make sure to go back to the app and turn the toggle off.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fps-counter-on-android-2a.jpg"                      alt="Granting the FPS Counter app access to screen recording and casting"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fps-counter-on-android-2b.jpg"                      alt="Options in FPS Counter app"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fps-counter-on-android-2c.jpg"                      alt="Playing a game with an FPS counter"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> You can also choose to enable the 1% and 0.1% low readings for your FPS and record games using the app. In our testing, the app wasn’t always successful in displaying the FPS in certain games, but it was the only other option.</p><h2 id="Squeeze-the-Most-Performance-Out-of-Your-Phone"><a href="#Squeeze-the-Most-Performance-Out-of-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Squeeze the Most Performance Out of Your Phone"></a>Squeeze the Most Performance Out of Your Phone</h2><p> Being able to glance over your FPS to ensure you have a smooth gaming experience is second nature to gamers. However, numbers don’t mean everything and there are various other ways you can boost your phone’s gaming performance without the paranoia of getting lower frame rates.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/android-retro-replaying-classic-pokemon-adventures/"><u>Android Retro: Replaying Classic Pokemon Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-driven-virtual-whodunnit-adventures/"><u>AI-Driven Virtual Whodunnit Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/analyzing-content-policies-steam-and-gog-contrast-study/"><u>Analyzing Content Policies: Steam & GOG Contrast Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/affordable-gaming-delights-for-your-switch-console/"><u>Affordable Gaming Delights for Your Switch Console</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-you-getting-your-moneys-worth-from-ea-play/"><u>Are You Getting Your Money's Worth From EA Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-5-gamers-buys-old-school-handheld-delights/"><u>Best 5 Gamers' Buys: Old-School Handheld Delights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-guide-how-to-make-talking-head-videos/"><u>In 2024, Easy Guide How To Make Talking Head Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-creating-cohesive-content-with-soundtracks-on-instagram/"><u>[New] Creating Cohesive Content with Soundtracks on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/simple-ways-to-get-recent-calls-back-from-vivo-s17-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-call-logs/"><u>Simple ways to get recent calls back from Vivo S17 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amp-up-arcade-vibes-with-enlarged-frontend-frames/"><u>Amp Up Arcade Vibes with Enlarged Frontend Frames!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-leap-forward-in-graphics-the-significance-of-rdna-35-and-its-launch-window/"><u>AMD's Leap Forward in Graphics - The Significance of RDNA 3.5 & Its Launch Window</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/bricked-your-honor-magic-6-heres-a-full-solution-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Bricked Your Honor Magic 6?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Amp-Up-Arcade-Vibes-with-Enlarged-Frontend-Frames"><a href="#Amp-Up-Arcade-Vibes-with-Enlarged-Frontend-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Amp Up Arcade Vibes with Enlarged Frontend Frames"></a>Amp Up Arcade Vibes with Enlarged Frontend Frames</h2><p> If you’re a gamer of a certain age, you likely have fond memories of your local arcade. Clutching your coins, challenging locals, and the rush of a crowd watching you succeed: the arcade delivered an experience unlike any other.</p><p> The good news is modern technology makes it possible to not only replicate those golden years, but make the experience of playing via an arcade even better than you remember. The secret to that sauce is a frontend designed with arcade play in mind, and it’s hard to beat Big Box, courtesy of LaunchBox—here’s why.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets"><a href="#What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets" class="headerlink" title="What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?"></a>What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?</h2><p> Think about the components needed to operate an arcade cabinet. You at least need a joystick with a set of buttons, speakers, a monitor, a cabinet, and a device to run the whole thing, like a desktop. But how do you navigate the system once it’s set up? That’s where frontend software comes in.</p><p> Frontend software finds the games installed on your device, displays them in an easy-to-navigate library, and lets you select each game via your arcade cabinet’s controls alone. It’s the same principle behind the software that allows you to explore your library on a PS5 or via the Steam client on your desktop using a gaming controller.</p><p> A frontend also adds order to the chaos that is your ROM collection. You want to know what you’re going to be playing before you select it. So you need to add key metadata for each game, like the title, platform, thumbnail art, etc., to make everything look nice and tidy.</p><p> This can take days of work alone. But not with Big Box. Let’s dig a bit deeper and learn why a premium subscription to LaunchBox is worth the cost of admission alone for Big Box if you’re setting up your own arcade cabinet.</p><h2 id="1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata"><a href="#1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata" class="headerlink" title="1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata"></a>1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata</h2><p> Whether you’ve tackled big projects, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >building a portable retro gaming console using a Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or added a few classic arcade games to your work desktop, you know how painful it is to organize your collection. You are forced to add in every bit of metadata manually in most cases, including hunting down individual bits of media for each game, like a bezel, screenshot, video, and so on.</p><p> It’s painful work, and for those with massive collections, you’ll be more prone to not organize anything. Don’t do that! Organize now to make it easier to find precisely what you want to play, and you’ll use it more frequently than not, guaranteed.</p><p> Leveraging the power of Big Box via EmuMovies automatically finds all of the metadata for each game automatically, allows you to essentially set it and forget it! But you’ll need to be a premium member of both, then link your EmuMovies account to LaunchBox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/configure-emumovies-1.jpg"                      alt="Linking EmuMovies and Launchbox"                ></p><p> Once linked, everything from bezels and marquees to videos, screenshots, and even descriptions about each game will populate each game’s entry. So when you’re searching through your library in Big Box, you get a vibrant, informative listing about each game so you know what you’re about to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/import-flyers-bezels-etc.jpg"                      alt="Importing metadata into Launchbox"                ></p><p> This saves days’ worth of work alone, and means <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/launchbox-premium-worth-buying/" >LaunchBox Premium is worth the cost of admission <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> highly recommend getting a lifetime subscription to both LaunchBox and EmuMovies. You’re looking at $135 for both licenses as of July 2023.</p><p> But in terms of ease-of-use and the time saved alone, it’s going to be money well spent. Especially if you want your arcade cabinet to grow with you as you keep adding games via Steam or another source.</p><h2 id="2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library"><a href="#2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library" class="headerlink" title="2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library"></a>2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library</h2><p> Want to know the importance of context? Look at this listing below as an example. If I had not used EmuMovies as I discussed a moment ago, this cabinet would be nothing but a list of games.</p><p> But because I imported the metadata a moment ago, now this listing has a description, trailer, a banner image, and even music from the game. It’s as informative as a listing of an episode or film on your favorite streaming service, making it easy to choose the game you want to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/emu-movies-front-page.jpg"                      alt="Game page in EmuMovies"                ></p><p> If you’re already familiar with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-launchbox-how-it-works/" >LaunchBox and how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you already know that you can add custom filters for your games, like the number of players per game or by genre. The filters you create in LaunchBox also appear in Big Box, making it easy to find the right game for the occasion.</p><h2 id="3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls"><a href="#3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls" class="headerlink" title="3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls"></a>3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls</h2><p> If you’re building your arcade cabinet for the first time, you’re probably wondering how the heck you’re going to be able to exit a game or adjust the volume. You may think you need dedicated buttons, and while that’s one route, Big Box solves this problem by allowing you to hotkey certain tasks.</p><p> For example, when I want to exit a game, I tap my<strong>Player 1 Start button</strong> and<strong>A button</strong> simultaneously twice to activate the<strong>Close the Active Window</strong> value, which exits my game. I can also do a different button combination for the volume control, among other functions.</p><h2 id="4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees"><a href="#4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees" class="headerlink" title="4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees"></a>4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees</h2><p> When you populate your library with metadata via EmuMovies, you probably notice that a marquee file is always downloaded. These files are used with a second screen, displayed as a marquee like a traditional arcade cabinet.</p><p> Once you have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-dual-monitors/" >set up dual monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your arcade system, go into Big Box then select<strong>Options &gt; General &gt; Marquee Screen &gt; Screen 2</strong> . Now, whenever you highlight a game in Big Box, your second screen will display the marquee for that particular game, usually reflective of the cabinet it was in during its heyday. It’s a nice touch that goes a long way toward making your cabinet feel authentic yet new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/second-screen-marquee-big-box.jpg"                      alt="Example of a second screen marquee in BigBox"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Unbroken Software LLC&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1gBLJ2IZJI" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell"><a href="#5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell"></a>5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell</h2><p> You don’t want to have to use a mouse to open Big Box every time your start the device running your cabinet. It’s preferable if you can dive right into your arcade cabinet’s frontend with as few steps as possible. Fortunately, Big Box makes it happen if your arcade cabinet is powered by Windows.</p><p> First, be sure that the device powering your arcade cabinet automatically logs into your account. For example, there are a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/automatically-sign-user-in-windows-10/" >ways to automatically sign into your account in Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Whatever operating system you are using, be sure it automatically logs in every time the device starts.</p><p> Next, start Big Box from LaunchBox. Then, go to <strong>System &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Enable Using Big Box as the Windows Shell &gt; Yes.</strong> The next time you reboot your device, Big Box will replace the Windows shell. If you need to get into Windows, you can still close Big Box via the Task Manager to gain access to Windows again.</p><h2 id="Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends"><a href="#Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends" class="headerlink" title="Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends"></a>Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends</h2><p> The amount of time and frustration saved alone is worth the cost of admission for LaunchBox and EmuMovies. It’s layered tidily in Big Box, making navigating your library of games via arcade controls so easy, you’ll wonder why other frontends are so complicated. Give it a shot, and you’ll become one of the converted.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="AI-Powered-Narrative-Building-for-Games"><a href="#AI-Powered-Narrative-Building-for-Games" class="headerlink" title="AI-Powered Narrative Building for Games"></a>AI-Powered Narrative Building for Games</h2><p> There are various ways you can incorporate ChatGPT into your video game scriptwriting workflow to get maximum productivity. The AI language model can help you simplify dialogue, add a little personality to characters, and even brainstorm quest ideas.</p><p> You can also use ChatGPT to automate repetitive tasks like writing barks and generating gameplay instructions. Here are some of the best ways you can use ChatGPT to make your video game scripts more engaging, along with prompt inspirations to help you get started.</p><h2 id="1-Simplify-the-Dialogue"><a href="#1-Simplify-the-Dialogue" class="headerlink" title="1. Simplify the Dialogue"></a>1. Simplify the Dialogue</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/simplifying-dialogue.jpeg"                      alt="simplifying dialogue using chatgpt"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “[Dialogue] Simplify this dialogue and make it more conversational for a video game.”</p></blockquote><p> ChatGPT excels at refining text for precision while preserving the intent and sentence structure. By using this prompt, you can eliminate unnecessary words from your dialogue to make it more conversational and engaging.</p><p> If you want to simplify dialogues in bulk, you can insert the whole dialogue tree into the prompt as well. If you run into the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-character-input-limit/" >ChatGPT character input limit, there are ways to bypass it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Just be sure to put the dialogues in quotation marks, so the chatbot can easily recognize them.</p><h2 id="2-Give-the-NPCs-Some-Character"><a href="#2-Give-the-NPCs-Some-Character" class="headerlink" title="2. Give the NPCs Some Character"></a>2. Give the NPCs Some Character</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-roleplay.jpeg"                      alt="chatgpt roleplaying as npc"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “Role-play as a [NPC character name and world setting]. [Provide some character history and background.]“</p></blockquote><p> Role-playing using ChatGPT provides an effective way to flesh out an NPC’s personality. Simply write down the world the character lives in and break down their history and function in the game.</p><p> You can then ask questions about the character, and the chatbot will role-play as the NPC to give you detailed answers. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-fictional-worldbuilding-how-to/" >use ChatGPT for fictional worldbuilding <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create new characters from scratch.</p><h2 id="3-Convey-Character-by-Adding-Emotion"><a href="#3-Convey-Character-by-Adding-Emotion" class="headerlink" title="3.

Convey Character by Adding Emotion</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-emotion.jpeg"                      alt="adding emotion using chatgpt"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “Add the emotion of [Insert emotion] to these video game dialogues made by [Insert character information and scenario]: [Insert dialogues].”</p></blockquote><p> ChatGPT can also help you add emotion to video game dialogues. This will let you convey an NPC’s backstory, context, and state of mind with words alone. Unsure what kind of emotions an NPC should be going through during a certain scenario? ChatGPT can help you with that as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/type-of-emotion.jpeg"                      alt="kinds of emotion"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “What kind of emotion should [Insert character information] during [Insert scenario]?”</p></blockquote><h2 id="4-Generate-Codex-Entries"><a href="#4-Generate-Codex-Entries" class="headerlink" title="4. Generate Codex Entries"></a>4. Generate Codex Entries</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-codex.jpeg"                      alt="chatgpt codex entry"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “Make video game codex entries for [insert items or characters whose codex entries you want to generate]. Include some interconnected lore in these codex entries to make the world feel more immersive.”</p></blockquote><p> It often gets difficult to generate unique codex entries from scratch to fit into the game world you’re creating. But with ChatGPT, you can have a bottomless pool of inspiration to work with.</p><p> You can ask the language model to generate all kinds of codex entries, such as item descriptions, lore tablets, character backgrounds, and even gameplay instructions. You can also instruct ChatGPT to create connections between different codex entries to make your game lore more interconnected.</p><h2 id="5-Brainstorm-Side-Quest-Ideas"><a href="#5-Brainstorm-Side-Quest-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="5. Brainstorm Side Quest Ideas"></a>5. Brainstorm Side Quest Ideas</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-side-quest.jpeg"                      alt="chatgpt side quest ideas"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “Give me side quest ideas for a [Insert game type] game set in a world with [Insert game setting and lore]. Be sure to include a reference to a video game where the side quest idea has been used.”</p></blockquote><p> ChatGPT can help you brainstorm interesting questlines that players will love. Ask the AI chatbot to generate different kinds of quests for you to potentially use in your video game script. You can also provide side quest ideas that you really liked in a certain video game for ChatGPT to take inspiration from.</p><p> Or, you could request the chatbot to provide you with quest examples from other video games. You can then judge how well these types of quests worked for the game in question before incorporating them in your own script.</p><h2 id="6-Write-Barks"><a href="#6-Write-Barks" class="headerlink" title="6. Write Barks"></a>6. Write Barks</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chatgpt-barks.jpeg"                      alt="chatgpt generating barks"                ></p><blockquote><p><strong>Prompt inspiration</strong> : “Give me a list of barks for a [Insert character type] commenting on the player’s [Insert situation for which you need the bark].”</p></blockquote><p> Barks in video games can often get repetitive and boring for players to hear again and again. And they’re even more monotonous to pen down. But you can instantly set your video game apart from other titles by generating interesting barks that provide valuable information to the player.</p><p> Thankfully, ChatGPT can help with this. All you need to do is provide the AI with the situation in which the bark is to be used and which character is going to say it. Then, the AI can generate a long list of barks for you to take inspiration from.</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Video-Game-Scripts-More-Engaging-With-ChatGPT"><a href="#Make-Your-Video-Game-Scripts-More-Engaging-With-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Video Game Scripts More Engaging With ChatGPT"></a>Make Your Video Game Scripts More Engaging With ChatGPT</h2><p> ChatGPT can be your personal video game scriptwriting assistant. It can help you simplify NPC or player dialogue to bring more clarity. You can also use it to write more interesting barks.</p><p> In terms of character development, ChatGPT can help you add emotions to a character and also give your NPCs a more fleshed-out character. The possibilities are virtually limitless. Plus, you can train ChatGPT to write video game scripts just like you. This will ensure your personal style stays in the script.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-aaa-game-publishers-just-getting-too-big-podcast/"><u>Are AAA Game Publishers Just Getting Too Big?

But when you downloaded it, the game looked very different from what you expected? Advertisements like these are misleading and are mainly designed to increase conversion rates. In this case, you might think of them as scams.</p><p> Why do companies use fake ads to promote their games? How can you confirm that the gameplay in the advertisement is real or just misleading? And how should you respond to such fake ads?</p><h2 id="What-Do-Fake-Ads-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Do-Fake-Ads-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Do Fake Ads Look Like?"></a>What Do Fake Ads Look Like?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/a-fake-game-ad-showing-a-man-floating-in-water-pulling-out-the-pin-to-save-his-life.jpg"                      alt="A Fake Game Ad Showing a Man Floating in Water Pulling Out the PIN to Save His Life"                ></p><p> Video ads showing gameplay that’s different from the actual game are considered fake. These misleading ads exaggerate the game’s graphics, making it seem more realistic than it is.</p><p> In some cases, advertisers use catchy headlines and visually appealing footage to attract the audience’s attention, while in other cases, they oversexualize the ad to encourage the viewer to take action.</p><p> Since these ads can be highly misleading, why are they allowed in the first place?</p><h3 id="Why-Don’t-Advertising-Companies-Ban-Fake-Ads"><a href="#Why-Don’t-Advertising-Companies-Ban-Fake-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why Don’t Advertising Companies Ban Fake Ads?"></a>Why Don’t Advertising Companies Ban Fake Ads?</h3><p> Ad companies usually approve such ads for publication and do not ban them because they are designed so that, despite misleading the audience, they do not violate a company’s terms and conditions.</p><p> Advertising companies consider ads deceptive and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-facebook-bans-ad-accounts/" >suspend ad accounts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they misrepresent a product or service in an effort to sell it. As fake gameplay ads do not involve a sale, they don’t qualify as misleading; they simply want the user to download the game free of charge.</p><p> Just like that, advertisers make every effort to ensure that their ads align with the company’s policies to avoid being banned. It begs the question: Why do companies use fake advertisements?</p><h2 id="Why-Do-Companies-Use-Fake-Advertisements-to-Promote-Their-Games"><a href="#Why-Do-Companies-Use-Fake-Advertisements-to-Promote-Their-Games" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Companies Use Fake Advertisements to Promote Their Games?"></a>Why Do Companies Use Fake Advertisements to Promote Their Games?</h2><p> Companies use fake advertisements to make their promotional campaigns successful. So, to understand why they do this, we must first understand what makes a campaign successful.</p><p> Ad campaigns require advertisers to pay a fee to the publisher, which then displays the ad to the targeted audience. Every time a user views the ad, an advertiser incurs a cost. If a user clicks on an ad and performs the action the ad was aimed at—in most cases, installing the game—it counts as a successful conversion.</p><p> With a more engaging ad, the conversion rate increases, the cost per install decreases, and the campaign becomes more successful. However, if more users skip the ad and don’t install the game, it costs companies more and lowers the conversion rate, making the campaign ineffective.</p><p> It makes sense, then, that companies invest a considerable amount to make the advertisement appealing. To achieve this, they don’t hesitate to make the ad appear exaggerated or even completely misleading. Because such ads serve the primary purpose of ad creation, companies continue to use them.</p><h2 id="How-Can-You-Verify-That-the-Ad-You-See-Is-Real-or-Fake"><a href="#How-Can-You-Verify-That-the-Ad-You-See-Is-Real-or-Fake" class="headerlink" title="How Can You Verify That the Ad You See Is Real or Fake?"></a>How Can You Verify That the Ad You See Is Real or Fake?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/real-and-fake-ostrich.jpg"                      alt="The real ostrich looks at the fake one over the fence."                ></p><p> So is there any way to check that the gameplay shown in the advertisement is real?</p><p> Confirming that the advertisement accurately represents the game you intend to install can save you from downloading something different to what you expected, and wasting your time and data. But how exactly can you do it?</p><p> Look at the related images under the app’s listing on the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). If the images aren’t in line with the gameplay, the ad is likely misleading.</p><p> Also, you can look up videos about the gameplay on YouTube. If the video doesn’t match what you’ve seen in the advertisement, it’s probably fake.</p><p> You can also read the most recent reviews on the store. If you see complaints about the game being different from what was portrayed in the advertisement, don’t download it.</p><h2 id="How-Should-You-Respond-to-the-Fake-Ad"><a href="#How-Should-You-Respond-to-the-Fake-Ad" class="headerlink" title="How Should You Respond to the Fake Ad?"></a>How Should You Respond to the Fake Ad?</h2><p> Besides not downloading the app through the misleading advertisement, if you are confident that the ad is fake, here’s what else you can do to prevent the wider community from wasting their time downloading the app:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/write-edit-reviews-google-play-store/" >Add a review under the app listing on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-rate-iphone-ipad-apps-app-store/" >alternatively rate apps on iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> describing how it uses fake gameplay to increase the number of installations.</li><li>If you’ve seen the ad on a social media platform that lets you comment under the listing, such as Facebook, comment about how misleading it is.</li><li>Immediately report the ad to the social media network so that they may review it and take it down.</li><li>Expose how the game misrepresents gameplay in its ad campaigns on Reddit and other platforms. Users who search for the game directly on Google or any <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/13-alternative-search-engines-that-find-what-google-cant/" >other search engine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will find this information useful.</li></ul><h2 id="How-Do-Fake-Advertisements-Affect-Companies"><a href="#How-Do-Fake-Advertisements-Affect-Companies" class="headerlink" title="How Do Fake Advertisements Affect Companies?"></a>How Do Fake Advertisements Affect Companies?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-of-graph-showing-a-decline.jpg"                      alt="graph falling off at the end"                ></p><p> Using misleading gameplay to run profitable campaigns isn’t always a good idea. Fake ads increase the number of installations cost-effectively but has many downsides.</p><p> First, fake ads can damage the company’s reputation in the long run. Getting misled into downloading a game in such a way could lead users to skip downloading other games from the same publisher. The company could lose long-term customers who think they scam users.</p><p> Also, since the actual gameplay differs from what users expect, most players quit playing the game, and companies lose their long-term clients.</p><p> Furthermore, the fake ads result in many negative reviews, which can badly impact the game’s organic ranking. Consequently, the app gets very few organic installs, and companies have to rely mostly on advertisements to get new users.</p><p> The list of ways in which misleading advertisements can backfire goes on and on, so ultimately, while it might seem tempting at first, it’s ultimately not worth pursuing this line of thinking.</p><h2 id="Don’t-Be-Misled-by-Fake-Gameplay-Ads"><a href="#Don’t-Be-Misled-by-Fake-Gameplay-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Be Misled by Fake Gameplay Ads"></a>Don’t Be Misled by Fake Gameplay Ads</h2><p> Knowing how to verify the authenticity of fake advertisements allows you to avoid being deceived. Be sure you report such ads to the social media platform they appear on. Take the necessary steps to prevent others from wasting their time and energy too.</p><p> And like fake gameplay ads, fake ads disguised as download links are all over the web. Keep an eye out for them to avoid being duped.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Apple’s-Sonoma-MacOS-Boosting-Gaming-Experience-with-Game-Mode"><a href="#Apple’s-Sonoma-MacOS-Boosting-Gaming-Experience-with-Game-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Apple’s Sonoma MacOS: Boosting Gaming Experience with Game Mode"></a>Apple’s Sonoma MacOS: Boosting Gaming Experience with Game Mode</h2><p> Game Mode is a feature introduced with macOS Sonoma that improves the gaming experience on Macs. It automatically optimizes games for smooth and responsive gameplay while reducing latency with wireless accessories like AirPods and controllers.</p><p> We’ll explore how Game Mode works and whether it makes a noticeable difference in your gaming experience.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Game-Mode"><a href="#What-Is-Game-Mode" class="headerlink" title="What Is Game Mode?"></a>What Is Game Mode?</h2><p> Historically,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-macs-arent-great-for-gaming/" >Macs have not been considered as good gaming machines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . However, Apple has started making a concerted effort to improve the gaming experience for Mac users, especially since switching to its own Apple silicon chips.</p><p> Game Mode works by assigning games a higher priority than other applications when it comes to using CPU and GPU resources. This means that games will have more resources available to them, which can lead to smoother gameplay and higher frame rates by allocating fewer hardware resources to background tasks.</p><p> Game Mode also reduces latency with wireless accessories by doubling the Bluetooth sample rate, leading to a lesser delay between when you press a button on your controller and when the action is reflected in the game.</p><p> This is particularly useful for titles where even a small amount of input lag can make a big difference, such as first-person shooters or fighting games.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-Game-Mode-on-Your-Mac"><a href="#How-to-Enable-Game-Mode-on-Your-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable Game Mode on Your Mac"></a>How to Enable Game Mode on Your Mac</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/macos-game-mode-menu.jpeg"                      alt="macOS Game Mode Menu with the option to turn Game Mode off"                ></p><p> Game Mode is automatically turned on when you launch a game in full-screen mode. There are no controls or options to turn it on manually until then. Once the game is running in full screen, you’ll see an icon of a game controller in <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mac-menu-bar-beginners-guide/" >the macOS menu bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> You will get this icon regardless of whether or not you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-mac/" >connect a controller to your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Clicking the game controller icon will open a menu with the name of the game being played in full screen. The only option in this menu is to<strong>Turn Game Mode Off</strong> .</p><p> To turn Game Mode back on, click the<strong>Turn Game Mode On</strong> option or simply re-launch the game in full screen.</p><h2 id="Does-Game-Mode-Make-a-Difference-in-macOS"><a href="#Does-Game-Mode-Make-a-Difference-in-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Does Game Mode Make a Difference in macOS?"></a>Does Game Mode Make a Difference in macOS?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/minecraft-with-shaders-1.jpeg"                      alt="Minecraft with Sildur&#39;s Vibrant Shaders running on macOS"                ></p><p> When I first tried running Minecraft: Java Edition with Sildur’s Vibrant Shaders in Game Mode, I didn’t see any improvement in the frame rate (FPS). The game still ran at a steady 30–35 FPS on a base model M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of unified memory (RAM). This was disappointing, as I was expecting a bigger difference.</p><p> However, I wanted to make sure that Game Mode was actually giving a higher priority to the game, so I ran the <a class="link"   href="https://browserbench.org/Speedometer2.0/" >Speedometer 2.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> browser benchmark simultaneously.</p><p> When Game Mode was turned off, the game ran alongside the Speedometer 2.0 benchmark with constant frame drops, resulting in a benchmark score of 360. Upon turning on Game Mode, the frame drops disappeared and the frame rate became stable, even though the benchmark score dropped to 240.</p><p> This suggests that Game Mode prioritizes games over other tasks, which can lead to a smoother and more consistent gaming experience.</p><p> With Game Mode enabled, I noticed a more responsive experience with my DualShock 4 controller. The latency was noticeably less, which made it feel like my inputs were being registered instantaneously. This made for a far more enjoyable gaming experience, as I could react more quickly to what was happening on the screen.</p><h2 id="Apple-Prioritizes-Gaming-on-Macs-With-Game-Mode"><a href="#Apple-Prioritizes-Gaming-on-Macs-With-Game-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Apple Prioritizes Gaming on Macs With Game Mode"></a>Apple Prioritizes Gaming on Macs With Game Mode</h2><p> Game Mode is a step in the right direction, but it is just one of many things Apple needs to do to make the Mac a more viable gaming platform. If Apple continues on this path, macOS could become a more popular gaming platform. However, it will take time and effort to make Macs a true competitor to PCs and consoles.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/affordable-highview-monitor-27m2v-pixels/"><u>Affordable HighView Monitor, 27M2V Pixels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-viral-beats-cutting-edge-music-for-youtube-short-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Viral Beats  Cutting-Edge Music for YouTube Short Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-the-ultimate-guide-to-cost-free-cgi-mastery-via-4-youtube-experts-insights/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Cost-Free CGI Mastery via 4 YouTube Experts' Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/baldurs-gate-3-for-m1m2-using-crossover-on-mac/"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 for M1/M2: Using Crossover on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-mac-devices-changing-gamers-landscape/"><u>Are Mac Devices Changing Gamers’ Landscape?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-clues-to-crack-virtual-crime-scenes/"><u>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-these-top-10-pitfalls-when-buying-a-monitor/"><u>Avoid These Top 10 Pitfalls When Buying a Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/adventure-awaits-in-augmented-reality/"><u>Adventure Awaits in Augmented Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/analyzing-content-policies-steam-and-gog-contrast-study/"><u>Analyzing Content Policies: Steam & GOG Contrast Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-leap-forward-in-graphics-the-significance-of-rdna-35-and-its-launch-window/"><u>AMD's Leap Forward in Graphics -

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Affordable-Gaming-Delights-for-Your-Switch-Console"><a href="#Affordable-Gaming-Delights-for-Your-Switch-Console" class="headerlink" title="Affordable Gaming Delights for Your Switch Console"></a>Affordable Gaming Delights for Your Switch Console</h2><p> After spending so much money buying a Nintendo Switch, you probably don’t have enough funds to buy all the games you want.</p><p> Fortunately, the Nintendo eShop has a solution: free-to-play games. There are many great games you can download and start playing without spending a single dime.</p><p> Here are some of the best free-to-play games you can get on your Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 id="1-Fall-Guys"><a href="#1-Fall-Guys" class="headerlink" title="1. Fall Guys"></a>1. Fall Guys</h2><p> It had been a long time coming, but in 2022, we finally saw Fall Guys for the first time on the Nintendo Switch. The good news is that Fall Guys came out as a free-to-play game. Was the wait worth it? That is probably up to you to decide.</p><p> What is true is that this game is still silly, charming, and fun to play. You’ll control your very own Fall Guy, which you can customize with different skins, accessories, and emotes.</p><p> There are also many different games you can play by yourself, with random players, or with friends and family. The main goal is to beat as many mini-games as possible and earn experience, Kudos (this game’s in-game currency), or Crowns.</p><p> While Fall Guys might feel repetitive if you play it for too long, it’s still a nice game to play on your off time or when you want to play something that doesn’t require much skill.</p><h2 id="2-Pokemon-Cafe-ReMix"><a href="#2-Pokemon-Cafe-ReMix" class="headerlink" title="2. Pokémon Café ReMix"></a>2. Pokémon Café ReMix</h2><p> If you love Pokémon, puzzles, and free games, you’ll surely love Pokémon Café ReMix. Previously known as Pokémon Café Mix, this game lets you manage your very own café and serve food and drinks to the Pokémon that visit you.</p><p> The gameplay is pretty simple: You’ll mostly need to cater to your customers and bring them the dishes they want. You create these dishes by solving puzzles and using the right ingredients. If a Pokémon likes your services and your café, they might even start working for you.</p><p> Granted, this game might not be for you if you’re more of a competitive player. But if you want a different Pokémon experience and want a nice relaxing time, you should try it. After all, the game is free to download on your Nintendo Switch, and you can play on your smartphone, too.</p><h2 id="3-Yu-Gi-Oh-Master-Duel"><a href="#3-Yu-Gi-Oh-Master-Duel" class="headerlink" title="3. Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel"></a>3. Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</h2><p> You’ve probably heard of Yu-Gi-Oh! before, but did you know there’s a game you can play for free on your console? Master Duel brings everything that makes Yu-Gi-Oh! fun and competitive to the Nintendo Switch.</p><p> Just like regular Yu-Gi-Oh!, Master Duel lets you create your own deck with many cards from the trading card game. You can then use your deck against players worldwide to reach different ranks. Or you can take your deck to the Solo mode, where you’ll play against the computer and earn many rewards.</p><p> While the game is really fun, it’s worth mentioning that you won’t have access to all these cards from the get-go. Like many other trading card games, you will have to pay for the chance to unlock several cards. What’s more, some of the most competitive decks will require two or even three copies of the same card, which might be a bit hard—and expensive—for most of us.</p><p> So, while the game is free, microtransactions might ruin your experience. The good news is that when you’re starting, the game will give you a good amount of gems, so you should be able to build a very good deck without spending a dime.</p><h2 id="4-Tetris-99"><a href="#4-Tetris-99" class="headerlink" title="4. Tetris 99"></a>4. Tetris 99</h2><p> Whoever said that Tetris and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-battle-royale-games/" >Battle Royale games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> don’t mix well together? Tetris 99 is an online version of the classic game Tetris. In it, you’ll compete against up to 98 other players.</p><p> The gameplay is the same as regular Tetris, so your goal is to keep your board clear as much as possible by aligning your bricks into rows to make them disappear. One of the key differences is that you can send “garbage” to other players to eliminate them. Of course, that’s easier said than done.</p><p> Surprisingly, the competitive aspect of Tetris 99 makes the game a really fun experience. Plus, winning a game feels way more satisfying.</p><p> It’s worth noting that while Tetris 99 is technically free, you will need a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online-everything-need-know/" >Nintendo Switch Online subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to play it. If you’re already subscribed, then this game is worth checking out.</p><h2 id="5-Fortnite"><a href="#5-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="5. Fortnite"></a>5. Fortnite</h2><p> Fortnite is a game that needs no introduction. This game has become so popular that it’s partnered with other popular names in the entertainment industry, like Ariana Grande, Marvel, and Dragon Ball.</p><p> Fortnite is one of the biggest online multiplayer and Battle Royale games available and one of the reasons is that the game is completely free to play.</p><p> You can buy anything from skins to emotes and battle passes using its in-game currency, V-Bucks—which you can get by playing or with real-life money—but you don’t need any of that to play the game and have some fun.</p><h2 id="6-Fallout-Shelter"><a href="#6-Fallout-Shelter" class="headerlink" title="6. Fallout Shelter"></a>6. Fallout Shelter</h2><p> Fallout Shelter is a Fallout game like you’ve never seen before. Instead of exploring the wasteland with nothing but your skills and weapons, you manage a vault and keep the people inside happy (and alive).</p><p> Each person, or dweller, will have different stats to help you keep your vault running properly. Depending on their SPECIAL stats, the dwellers can help you produce water, energy, or entertainment.</p><p> And, of course, since you’re still living in a post-apocalyptic world, some dwellers are good at fighting, which is great when you have to deal with the occasional infestations.</p><p> Fallout Shelter isn’t an action-packed game, but if you’re into management simulators and want to explore the wasteland, keep dwellers alive, and expand your vault into a fully-operational facility, this game is fun and will keep you playing on your Nintendo Switch or smartphone.</p><h2 id="7-Pokemon-Unite"><a href="#7-Pokemon-Unite" class="headerlink" title="7. Pokémon Unite"></a>7. Pokémon Unite</h2><p> If you don’t want to run a café for Pokémon, you can always try to make them fight in an arena. Pokémon Unite is an interesting multiplayer game in which you control a Pokémon and battle against other players online.</p><p> The game mechanics are pretty similar to games like League of Legends, so you’ll probably already know if this game is for you or not. You’ll enter an arena with four other players and start battling a different team.</p><p> The battle system is completely different from the main Pokémon games, so don’t expect your fire-type Pokémon to be super effective against your opponent’s water-type Pokémon. Instead, you’ll have to rely on your skills and special moves to defeat the opponent.</p><p> Pokémon Unite is one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-moba-games-to-play/" >best MOBA games you can play today <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You’ll have a great time if you’re a fan of the Pokémon franchise.</p><h2 id="8-Super-Kirby-Clash"><a href="#8-Super-Kirby-Clash" class="headerlink" title="8. Super Kirby Clash"></a>8. Super Kirby Clash</h2><p> Whether you love Kirby or want something to play with your friends, Super Kirby Clash is a perfect game for your Nintendo Switch.</p><p> This free-to-play game is the spiritual successor of a 3DS game called Kirby Clash Deluxe. You’ll have to team up with three other players to go on a quest to defeat evil bosses.</p><p> You and your teams can choose a Kirby variant with a different ability. For instance, you can stop time, heal your teammates, or cause a lot of damage to the bosses.</p><p> During your quests, you can earn different rewards to improve your weapons or unlock more quests. Overall, Super Kirby Clash is a cute game that will give you countless hours of fun with your friends and family.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="9-Rocket-League"><a href="#9-Rocket-League" class="headerlink" title="9. Rocket League"></a>9. Rocket League</h2><p> Do you love soccer and fast cars? Why not put them together and play some Rocket League? This free-to-play game has been one of the <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-awesome-cross-platform-mobile-multiplayer-games/" >most popular multiplayer titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since 2020 and for a good reason.</p><p> The rules are simple. You enter a soccer field with your favorite car, and your job is to score as many goals as you can. Playing soccer with a car makes the game both fun and difficult, but it is much more rewarding when you score.</p><h2 id="Have-Fun-Without-Spending-Money"><a href="#Have-Fun-Without-Spending-Money" class="headerlink" title="Have Fun Without Spending Money"></a>Have Fun Without Spending Money</h2><p> In this day and age, it’s pretty easy to play really cool video games without spending a dime, and the Nintendo Switch is no exception. You can try any of these games and see which ones you enjoy. Of course, you should always be careful with microtransactions since that’s how free-to-play games make money.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/boost-your-tv-experience-automatic-loops-of-youtube-videos/"><u>Boost Your TV Experience  Automatic Loops of YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/android-retro-replaying-classic-pokemon-adventures/"><u>Android Retro: Replaying Classic Pokemon Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-journey-to-crafting-a-unique-alphanumeric-marker-for-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Journey to Crafting a Unique Alphanumeric Marker for TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships - Top 16 on Xbox Series S/X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-quick-methods-to-bypass-honor-90-frp-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Quick Methods to Bypass Honor 90 FRP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/baldurs-gate-3-hardware-requirements-download-platforms-dlcs-and-more/"><u>Baldur's Gate 3: Hardware Requirements, Download Platforms, DLCs, and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-tecno-spark-20-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-clues-to-crack-virtual-crime-scenes/"><u>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/n-2024-craft-a-vibrant-youtube-experience-with-tracks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Craft a Vibrant Youtube Experience with Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-you-getting-your-moneys-worth-from-ea-play/"><u>Are You Getting Your Money's Worth From EA Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/analyzing-content-policies-steam-and-gog-contrast-study/"><u>Analyzing Content Policies: Steam & GOG Contrast Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-5-gamers-buys-old-school-handheld-delights/"><u>Best 5 Gamers' Buys: Old-School Handheld Delights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-can-i-use-a-fake-gps-without-mock-location-on-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Can I Use a Fake GPS Without Mock Location On Vivo V30?

And it’s been a hit so far, with some developers warning that it sets the bar too high.</p><p> You may already be certain you will love this major D&amp;D 5e video game title, but you still need more information before you make the $60 investment. Here, we’ll let you know everything you need to know so you can get in Baldur’s Gate 3 as ready as can be.</p><h2 id="What-Are-Baldur’s-Gate-3’s-Hardware-and-Software-Requirements"><a href="#What-Are-Baldur’s-Gate-3’s-Hardware-and-Software-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="What Are Baldur’s Gate 3’s Hardware and Software Requirements?"></a>What Are Baldur’s Gate 3’s Hardware and Software Requirements?</h2><p> Unlike its predecessors, you can’t run Baldur’s Gate 3 on a potato computer. While you don’t need the most powerful graphic cards, you would need a decent one if you want to enjoy your experience and explore this corner of Faerûn. Take a look at our list of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-graphics-cards/" >best graphic cards for any budget <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find something that works for you if you plan to play on a PC.</p><p>Here’s a table for Baldur’s Gate 3’s specs:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Windows</strong></th><th><strong>macOS</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - Windows 10 64-bit<strong>Recommended</strong> - Windows 10 64-bit</td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - macOS 10.15.6<strong>Recommended</strong> - macOS 10.15.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - Intel I5 4690 &#x2F; AMD FX 8350<strong>Recommended</strong> - Intel i7 8700K &#x2F; AMD r5 3600</td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - 2.6GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7<strong>Recommended</strong> - 2.3GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - 8GB RAM<strong>Recommended</strong> - 16GB RAM</td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - 8GB RAM<strong>Recommended</strong> - 16GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - Nvidia GTX 970 &#x2F; RX 480 (4GB+ of VRAM)<strong>Recommended</strong> - Nvidia 2060 Super &#x2F; RX 5700 XT (8GB+ of VRAM)</td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - AMD Radeon460 4GB<strong>Recommended</strong> - AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 8GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 11</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>150GB SSD</td><td><strong>Minimum</strong> - 150GB HDD<strong>Recommended</strong> - 150GB SSD</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Apple silicon Macs generally run Baldur’s Gate better than Intel Macs—just one of the reasons <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/do-i-need-an-apple-silicon-mac/" >you might need an Apple silicon Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><ul><li>M1 and M2 Macs with 8GB RAM could run this game on low settings (and this includes all MacBook Airs).</li><li>M1 and M2 Macs with 16GB of RAM can run Baldur’s Gate 3 on high or ultra settings.</li><li>(Intel) MacBook Pros from 2016 to early 2020 might need to run on low settings unless they have the recommended specs.</li></ul><h2 id="What-Platforms-Can-You-Get-Baldur’s-Gate-3-On-and-How-Much-Is-It"><a href="#What-Platforms-Can-You-Get-Baldur’s-Gate-3-On-and-How-Much-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Platforms Can You Get Baldur’s Gate 3 On, and How Much Is It?"></a>What Platforms Can You Get Baldur’s Gate 3 On, and How Much Is It?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-steam-store-page.jpeg"                      alt="Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Steam Store Page"                ></p><p> Baldur’s Gate 3 came out for PC on August 3rd, but it will come out for macOS and PS5 on September 6th, and perhaps next year for Xbox Series X|S. Larian Studios has issues getting the split-screen to work effectively on the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-x-vs-xbox-series-s-which-should-you-buy/" >cheaper and less powerful Xbox Series S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> You can get Baldur’s Gate 3 on PC and Mac from Steam, GOG, and GeForce Now. It costs $59.99 alone or $69.98 with the Digital Deluxe Edition DLC.</p><p> This is the only DLC for the game right now, and it features in-game cosmetics inspired by Divinity: Original Original Sin II, as well as a digital art book, printable character sheets, and a digital original soundtrack.</p><p> There are mods for Baldur’s Gate 3, but we suggest you wait a little longer to try them out since most were made with early access in mind.</p><h2 id="Does-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Have-a-Multiplayer-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Does-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Have-a-Multiplayer-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Does Baldur’s Gate 3 Have a Multiplayer, and How Does It Work?"></a>Does Baldur’s Gate 3 Have a Multiplayer, and How Does It Work?</h2><p> Baldur’s Gate 3 has a single-player mode you can play by yourself. However, you can quickly change your single-player game into a multiplayer game where your friends can join and control characters in your game.</p><p> But if you want a game where all the players have their own custom characters, you’ll need to press the<strong>Multiplayer</strong> button in Baldur’s Gate 3’s main menu. From there, you can host your party or join an existing party.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-s-multiplayer-menu.jpeg"                      alt="Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s multiplayer menu"                ></p><p> You can load saves across different platforms, but there’s no cross-play for PS5 and PC. Meaning that you can’t play with a friend using a PS5 if you’re using a PC and vice-versa.</p><p> And yes, you can play split-screen simply by activating another controller in-game.</p><p> You should run your split-screen game with DirectX instead of Vulkan because it could crash otherwise.</p><h2 id="Is-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Okay-for-Kids"><a href="#Is-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Okay-for-Kids" class="headerlink" title="Is Baldur’s Gate 3 Okay for Kids?"></a>Is Baldur’s Gate 3 Okay for Kids?</h2><p> If you were thinking of gifting this to an underage child, don’t. The game has very mature themes and contains nudity and sexual content. It’s a game for adults and not something you should give a child or even play around where a child could see. The game is rated 18 for violence, language, and sex.</p><p> There is a toggle to hide nudity in the character creation stage. This might help reduce the chances of a child seeing something inappropriate while you play.</p><h2 id="Now-You’re-Ready-to-Play-Baldur’s-Gate-3-or-Not"><a href="#Now-You’re-Ready-to-Play-Baldur’s-Gate-3-or-Not" class="headerlink" title="Now You’re Ready to Play Baldur’s Gate 3 (or Not)"></a>Now You’re Ready to Play Baldur’s Gate 3 (or Not)</h2><p> With all the information here, you should know all it takes to make Baldur’s Gate 3 work for you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Affordable-HighView-Monitor-27M2V-Pixels"><a href="#Affordable-HighView-Monitor-27M2V-Pixels" class="headerlink" title="Affordable HighView Monitor, 27M2V Pixels"></a>Affordable HighView Monitor, 27M2V Pixels</h2><p> A 4K monitor this size and with this kind of technology is never going to be cheap, but the Innocn model is far more affordable than anything you’ll find from bigger names. But are there too many trade-offs, or is the 27M2V the perfect mid-range gaming monitor?</p><h5 id="INNOCN-27M2V-Mini-LED-Monitor"><a href="#INNOCN-27M2V-Mini-LED-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="INNOCN 27M2V Mini LED Monitor"></a>INNOCN 27M2V Mini LED Monitor</h5><p> 9&#x2F; 10</p><p> The Innocn 27M2V Mini LED monitor has plenty of strengths, like its max 160Hz refresh rate, 4K resolution, and low input lag. Not everything about the monitor is great, but the downsides are easy to live with, like slightly clunky OSD navigation or the plastic but sturdy build quality. You’ll find monitors with better specs and more options, but they’ll cost you far more than the Innocn will.</p><p><strong>Brand</strong></p><p>INNOCN</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p>3840x2160</p><p><strong>Refresh Rate</strong></p><p>160Hz</p><p><strong>Screen Size</strong></p><p>27-inch</p><p><strong>Ports</strong></p><p> 2x HDMI 2.1, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 1x USB-C, 2x USB-A 3.0, 1x 3.5mm Audio Jack</p><p><strong>Display Technology</strong></p><p>IPS, mini-LED</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>16:9</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Great color</li><li>Excellent brightness in HDR or SDR</li><li>160Hz max refresh rate</li><li>Good response times and low input lag</li><li>Included stand is easy to adjust at any angle</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Some light haloing with light text on dark backgrounds</li><li>OSD navigation isn’t great</li><li>Plastic build</li></ul><p> Expand</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/INNOCN-Monitor-Computer-Connectivity-Adjustable/dp/B0BCK1Z5FD?tag=muo-v2-15nbvuh-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2027965&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/innocn-27m2v-review/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Build-and-Design"><a href="#Build-and-Design" class="headerlink" title="Build and Design"></a>Build and Design</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-front-right-angle.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V front right angle"                ></p><p> If you look at the Innocn 27M2V, it’s easy to assume that it’s made from metal, thanks to the silver finish. That said, turn it around, and you’ll realize that if it was made out of aluminum, it would be far too heavy thanks to the design of the back of the monitor.</p><p> The build is entirely plastic, which is one of the aspects that helps keep the monitor’s price down. This also keeps the weight on the lower side, though this did lead to the monitor wobbling while I was typing, even on a reasonably sturdy desk.</p><p> The ports are located on the underside of the back of the monitor. That can be tough to reach, though the included stand’s adjustability makes accessing the ports easier than on some other monitors. The ports are clearly labeled, meaning you won’t have to guess where to plug a cable in.</p><p> The buttons to control the on-screen display (OSD) are located in the bottom-right of the monitor, where you’ll often find monitor controls. While the power button is illuminated, all the buttons are the same shape, making finding them by feel somewhat tricky.</p><h2 id="Stand-and-Mounting"><a href="#Stand-and-Mounting" class="headerlink" title="Stand and Mounting"></a>Stand and Mounting</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-stand-attachment.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V stand attachment"                ></p><p> The included stand mounts easily on the back of the monitor in the same location where the 100x100mm VESA mount is found. Attaching the stand is easy: press the button, slot in the upper guide mounts, and let go of the button once the stand is attached.</p><p> As I mentioned above, the stand offers quite a bit of adjustability. You can adjust the height by 120mm, which is a fair amount of travel. You can also tilt the monitor forward and backward by 15 degrees, and even tilt the monitor on its side for a portrait orientation.</p><p> The monitor’s firmware handles switching between portrait and landscape orientation internally, so you shouldn’t have to adjust much on your computer. Even so, switching isn’t as easy as it could be. Even with the stand raised as high as possible, you can’t rotate the monitor on the stand. Instead, you need to lay the monitor down on its face and adjust the stand this way.</p><p> While that is a minor quibble, it’s easily made up for by how easy the height adjustment is. Just lightly push from below to raise the monitor or lightly pull from the top to lower it. Once you get it perfect, the stand holds the monitor in place with no other adjustments Needed.</p><h2 id="Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Ports and Connectivity"></a>Ports and Connectivity</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-ports.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V ports"                ></p><p> Underneath the Innocn 27M2V, you’ll find plenty of ports to connect to any hardware you like. There are a pair of 48Gbps HDMI 2.1 ports and DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC. You’ll also find a DP Alt capable USB-C port that supplies up to 90W, or 65W in HDR mode.</p><p> Another pair of USB 3.0 ports works as a USB hub, effectively turning the monitor into a barebones dock if you connect via USB-C. You also get a 3.5mm for either headphones or running audio to an external set of speakers. The 27M2V also features a pair of built-in speakers that we’ll look at more in-depth later in the article.</p><p> Innocn markets this as a gaming monitor, and while gaming-centric monitors often focus on PCs, this will work fine with your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S. With the dual HDMI connectors on the back, you could even plug in both consoles and your PC via DisplayPort or USB-C, switching via the monitor.</p><h2 id="Setup"><a href="#Setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-logo.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V logo"                ></p><p> Setting up the Innocn is relatively easy. First, attach the stand, then plug in the device or devices you plan on using with the monitor. If you’re using separate speakers, now is the time to plug them in too.</p><p> While the monitor itself is on the thinner side, the included stand gives it a larger footprint. Looking at the depth, you’ll need around 10 inches for the monitor, though this may increase if you plan on angling the monitor. This larger footprint does help with stability, which you’ll appreciate if you adjust the height often.</p><p> There’s one final aspect of the setup process worth mentioning if you plan on using the monitor’s high dynamic range (HDR) capabilities. HDR is turned off by default. To enable HDR, open the OSD menu and navigate to “Game Settings,” then scroll down to the HDR menu option and set it to “Standard.” You can press<strong>Win + Shift + B</strong> on Windows to activate HDR mode.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Controls"><a href="#Features-and-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Features and Controls"></a>Features and Controls</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-controls.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V controls"                ></p><p> While many monitors have shifted to rough joystick designs or other more intuitive control schemes, the controls are one area where the Innocn monitor is stuck in the past. These front-bottom mounted buttons make it too easy to select the wrong options and menus in the on-screen display (OSD).</p><p> You may never get used to the controls, but that shouldn’t be much of an issue, as there isn’t often much of a reason to dive into the OSD. You need to do it to enable HDR as mentioned above, and if you’re calibrating the monitor, you may be here a while, but you shouldn’t need to spend too much time outside of enabling options like AMD FreeSync.</p><p> Depending on where you place the 27M2V, one of the nicer features may be the light sensor for automatic brightness. As with many of these, this can be overly sensitive, and I found that I would get flashes of dimming or brightness simply from typing at my desk. That said, if your monitor spends half the day in the sun and the rest in the shade, the sensor is handy.</p><p> Many of the other features are more game-specific, like the built-in crosshair overlay. Others like the refresh rate display make it easier to track down issues in getting variable refresh rates to work as intended.</p><h2 id="Display-Performance"><a href="#Display-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Display Performance"></a>Display Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-front-angle.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V front angle"                ></p><p> As confusing as the controls may be and however plasticky the body may be, the display panel is the star of the show here. This is a 3840 x 2160 panel lit by a Mini LED array that approaches the contrast of OLED without the associated cost, with a contrast level listed at 1000:1. You get a maximum refresh rate of 160Hz and 600 nits of brightness, with a peak of 1,200 nits.</p><p> Add a 1ms claimed response time (we’ll look at this more later) and you’ve got what seems like a nice panel for gaming, and it is. The monitor covers 100 percent of sRGB and 95 percent DCI-p3, which means excellent color for gaming and videos. The accuracy isn’t the best out of the box, but with some time and the right tools, you can calibrate the monitor well enough for content creation work.</p><p> Using the OSD, you can choose between 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rates. For anything higher, you’re going to need to enable variable refresh rate by activating FreeSync on the monitor. You can find this setting in the Game Settings section of the OSD.</p><p> While the blacks don’t get as black as you’d expect from an OLED panel, they get admirably close. Similar to a quantum dot panel, the only real clue that you have that it’s on when displaying a black screen is a soft backlight (that you’ll have a hard time noticing in daylight).</p><p> Thanks to the Mini-LED backlight array—which means the monitor can selectively brighten or dim areas of the screen, rather than the whole panel at once—I didn’t notice much in the way of backlight bleed. While larger white text on a black background had a slight haloing effect, it wasn’t overly noticeable.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Performance"><a href="#Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Performance"></a>Gaming Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-rear.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V rear"                ></p><p> Gaming is the main focus of this monitor, so to ensure rapid response, it has four response time modes: off, normal, fast, and ultrafast. Normal and up are overdrive modes, aiming to compensate for input lag. For the most part, you can stick with normal, though the fast and ultrafast modes can impart too much overshoot.</p><p> AMD FreeSync is supported, as mentioned above. All you need to do is enable it in the OSD. While this isn’t an officially certified monitor for Nvidia G-Sync, I’ve seen reports of people making it work. In my case, I didn’t get G-Sync working, but this was with a laptop, which is typically more fussy to work with.</p><p> Regardless of which variable refresh rate mode you’re using, the upper limit is 160Hz, but you’ll rarely see it. In most cases, you’ll find the monitor tops out at 144Hz. This is plenty fast for most people, but if you’re looking for higher rates, they don’t tend to pop up here, for whatever reason.</p><p> Firing up Diablo IV, the colors looked great, and the refresh rate had the frame rates feeling smoother than ever. The feel was similar in Exoprimal, with zero tearing as the squad made its way through wave after wave of invading future dinosaurs.</p><h2 id="Built-in-Speakers"><a href="#Built-in-Speakers" class="headerlink" title="Built-in Speakers"></a>Built-in Speakers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/innocn-27m2v-front-left-angle.jpg"                      alt="Innocn 27M2V front left angle"                ></p><p> Though they’re common in similarly sized TVs, speakers are still a relative rarity in gaming monitors. The Innocn 27M2V features a pair of built-in speakers, but while they’re functional, they’re about as barebones as you might expect given the price.</p><p> The thin nature of a modern monitor doesn’t leave much room for large speakers or much space for sound to reverberate. While the speakers sound roughly as good as those you’d find in a TV of the same size, that’s not saying much about them. TVs often use digital signal processing to improve the sound, but that doesn’t seem to be present here.</p><p> Of course, it’s better to have the built-in speakers and not need them than wish they were there and not have them. That said, you need to use either your PC’s volume or the OSD to adjust volume, and the general feel is that the sound is more of an afterthought than anything you’ll want to spend much time using.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-Innocn-27M2V"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-Innocn-27M2V" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the Innocn 27M2V?"></a>Should You Buy the Innocn 27M2V?</h2><p> The Innocn 27M2V isn’t cheap, but it’s relatively affordable for a 4K gaming monitor, especially one with as many features as it has. While it isn’t super accurate out of the box, you can easily calibrate it for photo or video work with the right tool, and if you’re gaming, you won’t need any tweaks.</p><p> The menu buttons are annoying, the build is plastic, and there’s a slight janky to the experience, but to get rid of those cons, you’d have to spend considerably more. The Innocn 27M2V is a fantastic deal.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tricks-to-increase-viewership-on-your-tiktok-unboxing-sessions/"><u>2024 Approved  Tricks to Increase Viewership on Your TikTok Unboxing Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-mac-devices-changing-gamers-landscape/"><u>Are Mac Devices Changing Gamers’ Landscape?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/update-hardware-drivers-with-device-manager-on-windows-7-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Update hardware drivers with Device Manager on Windows 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/baldurs-gate-3-for-m1m2-using-crossover-on-mac/"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 for M1/M2: Using Crossover on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-we-witnessing-the-onset-of-gpu-expensive-era/"><u>Are We Witnessing the Onset of GPU Expensive Era?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/new-10-best-free-ai-video-generators-with-innovative-and-advanced-algorithms-for-2024/"><u>New 10 Best Free AI Video Generators with Innovative and Advanced Algorithms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-driven-virtual-whodunnit-adventures/"><u>AI-Driven Virtual Whodunnit Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-guide-non-commercial-android-recorder-choice/"><u>[New] Essential Guide  Non-Commercial Android Recorder Choice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/mechanized-sky-dwellers-classes-for-2024/"><u>Mechanized Sky-Dwellers' Classes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/approach-for-resolving-components-needed-fault/"><u>Approach for Resolving Components Needed Fault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-realmefrp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-5-Gamers’-Buys-Old-School-Handheld-Delights"><a href="#Best-5-Gamers’-Buys-Old-School-Handheld-Delights" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Gamers’ Buys: Old-School Handheld Delights"></a>Best 5 Gamers’ Buys: Old-School Handheld Delights</h2><p> Emulation has always been a strong suit for PC gamers, and it’s now more accessible than ever thanks to retro handhelds. These affordable and pocket-friendly devices often imitate the style of classic handhelds such as the Game Boy Advance, but they feature a clever twist. Rather than using cartridges for games, they feature emulators that can play games from various consoles.</p><p> This includes classics like NES games all the way up to the Nintendo DS. If you’re passionate about gaming and want to get a bite-sized taste of nostalgia, retro handhelds from the likes of Anbernic and Analogue are a must-have. Here’s everything you need to know about these compact gaming devices and why you might want one.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Retro-Handheld"><a href="#What-Is-a-Retro-Handheld" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Retro Handheld?"></a>What Is a Retro Handheld?</h2><p> The handheld above is an excellent example of what we’re talking about in this article. It features an IPS display, 64GB of storage, and the ability to emulate PlayStation 1 games. Once you’re done with the setup process, these handhelds are the best way to experience games from your childhood.</p><p> They often feature either a completely custom Linux-based OS or even a version of Android. This allows you to quickly download emulators and games from different console generations. It’s quite similar to downloading <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-game-emulators-for-android/" >emulators on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with the only difference being that you get dedicated buttons and a better form factor.</p><h2 id="1-Retro-Handhelds-Can-Emulate-a-Huge-Number-of-Games"><a href="#1-Retro-Handhelds-Can-Emulate-a-Huge-Number-of-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Retro Handhelds Can Emulate a Huge Number of Games"></a>1. Retro Handhelds Can Emulate a Huge Number of Games</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/retro-gaming-handheld-games.jpg"                      alt="Retro gaming handheld games"                ></p><p> The main reason why you should care about retro handhelds is the emulation aspect. Emulation capabilities vary from model to model, but most devices can handle older consoles just fine. Some even feature built-in visual enhancements that make your older games look even better. If you know what you’re doing, you can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-retroarch-cheat-retro-games/" >use a frontend like RetroArch to add cheats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you’re interested in buying a handheld, make sure to check for reviews on YouTube, as it has a very niche but active community covering almost every popular handheld. You can easily find reviews for most handhelds, and they’ll tell you which consoles certain handhelds can emulate.</p><h2 id="2-Cloud-Gaming-Makes-Handhelds-More-Exciting"><a href="#2-Cloud-Gaming-Makes-Handhelds-More-Exciting" class="headerlink" title="2. Cloud Gaming Makes Handhelds More Exciting"></a>2. Cloud Gaming Makes Handhelds More Exciting</h2><p> Since a lot of these retro handhelds are running on Android, cloud gaming is another aspect that makes the value even better. If you buy an Android handheld, you can try your hand at Xbox Cloud Gaming, Steam Link, GeForce Now, and more. Since cloud gaming relies on your internet connection, the specs for your handheld don’t matter at all</p><p> Of course, it’s up for debate <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/cloud-gaming-mainstream/" >whether cloud gaming is ready to go mainstream or not <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Internet speeds, subscription costs, and titles being removed from platforms are all valid concerns. However, you can get a decent experience if you live in a region that supports these services and have a decent internet connection.</p><h2 id="3-Retro-Handhelds-Have-Great-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Retro-Handhelds-Have-Great-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3. Retro Handhelds Have Great Battery Life"></a>3. Retro Handhelds Have Great Battery Life</h2><p> The average retro handheld can last anywhere from two to four hours without recharging, depending on how graphically intensive of a game you’re playing. That may not sound like a lot, but considering these are more casual gaming devices, it’s more than enough. Rather than sitting around aimlessly on your commute, you could spend an hour playing something like Metroid.</p><p> If you want even better battery life, you can go for the larger handhelds that are less pocket-friendly. These can still easily fit into your bag, making them easy enough to carry around while traveling. Just remember that factors like processing power and screen resolution also heavily impact battery life.</p><h2 id="4-Newer-Handhelds-Have-Better-Displays"><a href="#4-Newer-Handhelds-Have-Better-Displays" class="headerlink" title="4. Newer Handhelds Have Better Displays"></a>4. Newer Handhelds Have Better Displays</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/anbernic-rg35xx-retro-handheld.jpg"                      alt="Anbernic RG35XX retro handheld"                ></p><p> If reading about retro handhelds excites you, it’s likely that you were once attached to gaming handhelds like the Game Boy Advance or Nintendo DS. While those consoles were excellent at the time, the screens certainly have not aged well at all. This statement becomes especially true when you pick up an older Game Boy.</p><p> Fortunately, LCD panels have come a long way since then. Most of these retro handhelds feature sharp IPS screens that are miles ahead of older handhelds. These vivid and high-contrast screens breathe new life into classic games. It works especially well for games from the SNES and Game Boy eras.</p><h2 id="5-Handhelds-Are-Better-Than-Mobile-Gaming"><a href="#5-Handhelds-Are-Better-Than-Mobile-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="5. Handhelds Are Better Than Mobile Gaming"></a>5. Handhelds Are Better Than Mobile Gaming</h2><p> Retro handhelds are the definitive way to experience classic games on the go. The ability to quickly install emulators&#x2F;games while having dedicated buttons for a comfortable gaming experience makes them better than mobile gaming. Sure, you could easily download emulators on your PC or phone, but the experience just isn’t the same.</p><p> Gaming sessions on your phone can get interrupted by calls, random notifications, alarms, and more. You don’t experience any of that with retro handhelds as they are designed to just play games. Other than that, you’ll likely have a better time playing some old classics rather than being bogged down by microtransactions all the time.</p><h2 id="How-the-Steam-Deck-Plays-Into-This"><a href="#How-the-Steam-Deck-Plays-Into-This" class="headerlink" title="How the Steam Deck Plays Into This"></a>How the Steam Deck Plays Into This</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/valve-steam-deck-handheld.jpg"                      alt="Valve Steam Deck handheld"                ></p><p> Valve’s Steam Deck is incredibly interesting because it sort of blurs the line between console and PC gaming. It runs on a custom operating system known as SteamOS which will be familiar to many gamers. The design is similar to the Steam Store on Windows, and this allows you to access your entire Steam library and quickly download games on the go.</p><p> That alone is impressive, but the fact that you can download emulators and play retro games makes it an even better value. By switching to the Linux desktop mode, you can install a custom frontend and load your favorite emulators and games on there. Valve has massively expanded the competition for retro handhelds, and that means we’ll get even better handhelds in the future.</p><h2 id="Retro-Handhelds-Are-Pretty-Great"><a href="#Retro-Handhelds-Are-Pretty-Great" class="headerlink" title="Retro Handhelds Are Pretty Great"></a>Retro Handhelds Are Pretty Great</h2><p> Even if you put the nostalgia factor to the side, retro handhelds are undeniably incredible. You have access to a gigantic library of games, loads of customization, great portability, sharp screens, and more. The community has been vocal but niche for a while now, and the Steam Deck is only going to improve things solely with its existence.</p><p> With that said, the only downside is that not everyone will be willing to go through the hassle of setting up emulators or playing around with settings. Many would just rather have a simpler gaming experience. Fortunately, there are always alternatives to playing classics on the go and the Nintendo Switch is a great example.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-strategies-for-boosting-your-youtube-shorts-audience/"><u>In 2024, Strategies for Boosting Your YouTube Shorts Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-innovate-your-screenshots-unveiling-ezvides-screen-casting-features/"><u>[New] Innovate Your Screenshots  Unveiling EZvide's Screen Casting Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-ergonomic-gamepad-options/"><u>Best Ergonomic Gamepad Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-elgato-stream-deck-top-picks-and-comparisons/"><u>Best Elgato Stream Deck: Top Picks & Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoiding-robloxs-low-memory-warnings-tips-for-iphones/"><u>Avoiding Roblox's Low-Memory Warnings: Tips for iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/after-the-subscription-apsplus-games-new-path/"><u>After the Subscription: APS+ Game's New Path</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-handbook-for-recording-facial-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Handbook for Recording Facial Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-music-video-production-companies-for-unforgettable-mvs/"><u>Updated In 2024, Best Music Video Production Companies for Unforgettable MVs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships -

EA isn’t lagging behind this trend with its EA Play subscription.</p><p> Here’s what you should know about EA Play and whether it’s worth the money.</p><h2 id="What-Is-EA-Play"><a href="#What-Is-EA-Play" class="headerlink" title="What Is EA Play?"></a>What Is EA Play?</h2><p> EA Play offers members access to many EA titles for a monthly subscription. You also get Game Trials, which lets you try new EA titles for up to 10 hours without buying them. If you decide to purchase a game after trying it, you get to keep your progress, so you don’t have to start all over again.</p><p> EA Play members also get a 10% discount on EA digital content, including expansions, passes, packs, and DLCs. The subscription also offers in-game challenges and rewards, letting you get more out of your games and giving you a more competitive experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ea-play-vs-ea-play-pro.jpg"                      alt="EA Play vs EA Play Pro"                ></p><p> EA Play comes in two tiers. The base EA Play, which costs $4.99 a month or $29.99 a year, lets you access many popular EA titles and gives you the Game Trials, Member Rewards, and 10% discount benefits.</p><p> But if you’re a hardcore EA fan, you could select the EA Play Pro subscription. This tier costs $14.99 monthly or $99.99 annually but gives you access to even more EA titles. You can also play premium editions of some newly-released games even before their official release date.</p><h2 id="What-Popular-Games-Are-Included-in-EA-Play"><a href="#What-Popular-Games-Are-Included-in-EA-Play" class="headerlink" title="What Popular Games Are Included in EA Play?"></a>What Popular Games Are Included in EA Play?</h2><p> One of the reasons you choose a subscription is to get access to your favorite game titles. At the time of writing, EA Play gives you access to 89 titles, while EA Play Pro gives you access to 61 additional titles for a total of 150 games.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ea-play-games.jpg"                      alt="EA Play games"                ></p><p> Some of the most popular titles you can get with a basic EA Play subscription include the Battlefield series, from Battlefield 3 to Battlefield 2042, seven Need for Speed titles, including the three latest releases (Payback, Heat, and Unbound), and a few classics like Burnout Paradise Remastered, the Command &amp; Conquer collection, and SimCity 3000 Unlimited.</p><p> You also get several trilogies, including Crysis, Dead Space, and Mass Effect. Here’s a <a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play/games#ea-app" >complete list of all EA Play games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the EA website.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ea-play-pro-games.jpg"                      alt="Ea Play Pro games"                ></p><p> The more expensive EA Play Pro subscription includes everything in the EA Play subscription plus more niche games, like several titles from EA Sports and many Star Wars franchise titles.</p><p> You also get a few top-billed indie games like FTL: Faster Than Light, Frostpunk, and They Are Billions. If you want to see all the games included in this subscription, you can check out this <a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play/games#ea-play-pro" >list of all EA Play Pro games on PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Is-EA-Play-Worth-the-Price"><a href="#Is-EA-Play-Worth-the-Price" class="headerlink" title="Is EA Play Worth the Price?"></a>Is EA Play Worth the Price?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/man-playing-on-a-gaming-pc.jpg"                      alt="man playing on a gaming pc"                ></p><p> Gorodenkoff&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/professional-gamer-playing-firstperson-shooter-online-1430140334" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The EA Play subscription gives you access to many loved titles in the EA library, whether you’re using a PC, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox Series X|S console. But is the cost worth it?</p><p> While the EA Play subscription is available on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, not all EA games will work on gaming consoles. You should check if your favorite title is available on your preferred platform before committing to a subscription to avoid disappointments.</p><p> Furthermore, although you can get EA Play for all three platforms, your membership is tied to the platform you joined on. So, if you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-subscribe-to-and-use-ea-play-on-ps5/" >sign up for EA Play on the Playstation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can’t use your subscription on your Steam account. This means that you must purchase a separate subscription for these devices.</p><p> EA Play’s biggest competitor is <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-xbox-game-pass-everything-need-know/" >Xbox Game Pass for PC and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The former costs $9.99 monthly, while the latter will set you back by $16.99 monthly.</p><p> While the Xbox Game Pass for PC is twice the price of EA Play’s base offering, it does have one big ace up its sleeve—it includes an EA Play subscription, meaning you get everything it offers plus more. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also gives you access to everything in Game Pass for PC, plus the ability to stream your games from the cloud and other features.</p><p> The Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription will allow you to use your subscription on both PC and Xbox. So, besides including the basic EA Play subscription and several other features, you can also use it across console and PC, giving you a whole lot more value than EA Play as a standalone subscription.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/xbox-game-pass-and-ea-play.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for Xbox Game Pass and EA Play"                ></p><p> Image Credit: <a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?WT.mc_id=CNavGamesXboxGamePassUltimate" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re a fan of specific game titles in the EA library, it’s better to purchase these titles directly on Steam so that you’ll always have ownership of these games. But if you’re a PC gaming fan, Xbox Game Pass gives you more value, as you get many more titles and you are not limited to EA titles only.</p><p> In fact, Xbox Game Pass for PC has 453 titles at the time of writing, including titles from EA, Ubisoft, Xbox Game Studios, and more. For players with an Xbox Series X and a gaming PC, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the best subscription, especially as it’s just $2 more than EA Play Pro, but you get so much more.</p><p> EA Play isn’t exactly the best value gaming subscription out there, especially if you’re a PC gamer. Unless you’re a superfan of Electronic Arts, you’re better off going for Xbox Game Pass for PC or just buying your favorite titles outright from Steam or EA.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/balancing-steam-sensation-with-child-safety/"><u>Balancing Steam Sensation with Child Safety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-ideas-to-maximize-gopro-battery-performance/"><u>In 2024, Ideas to Maximize GoPro Battery Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/adventure-awaits-in-augmented-reality/"><u>Adventure Awaits in Augmented Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-mac-devices-changing-gamers-landscape/"><u>Are Mac Devices Changing Gamers’ Landscape?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-crash-landings-fixing-windows-based-epic-games-problems/"><u>Avoid Crash Landings: Fixing Windows-Based Epic Games Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/androids-gateway-to-segas-dreamcatcher-era/"><u>Android's Gateway to Sega's Dreamcatcher Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/92195913-new-dazzle-and-stand-out-50-free-youtube-branding-pieces/"><u>[New] Dazzle and Stand Out  50 FREE YouTube Branding Pieces!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-abnormal-arrival-annoyance-lol-style/"><u>Avoid Abnormal Arrival Annoyance, LoL Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/in-2024-say-cheese-16-best-apps-to-convert-your-photos-into-cartoons/"><u>In 2024, Say Cheese! 16 Best Apps to Convert Your Photos Into Cartoons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-leap-forward-in-graphics-the-significance-of-rdna-35-and-its-launch-window/"><u>AMD's Leap Forward in Graphics - The Significance of RDNA 3.5 & Its Launch Window</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-8-lite-simulations-playing-android-on-desktop/"><u>Best 8 Lite Simulations: Playing Android on Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-elgato-stream-deck-top-picks-and-comparisons/"><u>Best Elgato Stream Deck: Top Picks & Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/approach-for-resolving-components-needed-fault/"><u>Approach for Resolving Components Needed Fault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-bring-your-ideas-to-life-top-animation-software-for-newbies-and-pros/"><u>New 2024 Approved Bring Your Ideas to Life Top Animation Software for Newbies and Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-these-top-10-pitfalls-when-buying-a-monitor/"><u>Avoid These Top 10 Pitfalls When Buying a Monitor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-clues-to-crack-virtual-crime-scenes/"><u>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-buyers-remorse-with-pc-compatibility-checks/"><u>Avoid Buyer's Remorse with PC Compatibility Checks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-we-witnessing-the-onset-of-gpu-expensive-era/"><u>Are We Witnessing the Onset of GPU Expensive Era?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-these-6-pitfalls-with-intels-upcoming-chips/"><u>Avoid These 6 Pitfalls with Intel's Upcoming Chips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/enhancing-user-experience-powertoys-on-win11/"><u>Enhancing User Experience: PowerToys on Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-companion-accessories-for-steam-deck-24/"><u>Best Companion Accessories for Steam Deck '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/android-retro-replaying-classic-pokemon-adventures/"><u>Android Retro: Replaying Classic Pokemon Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/stuck-at-android-system-recovery-of-motorola-moto-g04-fix-it-easily-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Stuck at Android System Recovery Of Motorola Moto G04 ?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Baldur’s-Gate-3-for-M1-M2-Using-Crossover-on-Mac"><a href="#Baldur’s-Gate-3-for-M1-M2-Using-Crossover-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Baldur’s Gate 3 for M1&#x2F;M2: Using Crossover on Mac"></a>Baldur’s Gate 3 for M1&#x2F;M2: Using Crossover on Mac</h2><p> The much anticipated Baldur’s Gate 3 is finally out on PC after two decades since its predecessor’s, Baldur’s Gate 2’s, release. The game has been in early access since 2020, and it will remain in early access for Mac users till September, at least.</p><p> Yes, it’s a bummer, but there’s a way to work around it using a Windows virtual machine. And no, we aren’t using Parallels; instead, we’ll be using a leaner, meaner Windows virtual software: CrossOver.</p><h2 id="Get-Baldur’s-Gate-3-on-Steam"><a href="#Get-Baldur’s-Gate-3-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Get Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam"></a>Get Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam</h2><p> Baldur’s Gate is available on GOG, GeForce Now, and Steam, but you should shun all except Steam. That’s because CrossOver supports Steam the best, and you’ll get a better experience from it than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-in-steam-cart.jpeg"                      alt="Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in Steam cart"                ></p><p> You don’t need a virtual machine for this step. Go to Steam. Search Baldur’s Gate 3, and pay $59.99 for the game. Once you have a receipt, you’re ready to move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="Download-Install-and-Set-Up-CrossOver-and-Steam"><a href="#Download-Install-and-Set-Up-CrossOver-and-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Download, Install, and Set Up CrossOver and Steam"></a>Download, Install, and Set Up CrossOver and Steam</h2><p> What separates CrossOver from Parallels is that CrossOver isn’t an emulator; CrossOver is a ‘translator’ that changes macOS commands to Windows commands. Therefore, we strongly recommend you use CrossOver for a game as demanding as Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><p> If you use an Intel Mac, you don’t need a virtual machine to run Baldur’s Gate 3. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/run-windows-10-natively-mac-good-bad-ugly/" >run Windows 11 natively on the Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download the game there.</p><p> The process for setting up CrossOver is quite long, so we’ve detailed it in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-windows-games-on-an-apple-silicon-mac-using-crossover/" >how to play Windows games on a Mac using CrossOver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But summarily, you need to install CrossOver, then install a Steam bottle (or environment), and then download and install DXVK and DirectX into the bottle. Everything is detailed in the above guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/steam-information-page-in-crossover-1.jpeg"                      alt="Steam information page in CrossOver-1"                ></p><p> Once that’s done, log in to Steam with your details and install Baldur’s Gate 3 from your library. As soon as it’s done, you can attempt to run it.</p><h2 id="Run-Baldur’s-Gate-3-With-CrossOver"><a href="#Run-Baldur’s-Gate-3-With-CrossOver" class="headerlink" title="Run Baldur’s Gate 3 With CrossOver"></a>Run Baldur’s Gate 3 With CrossOver</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-page-in-the-steam-library-on-crossover.jpeg"                      alt="Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 page in the Steam library on CrossOver"                ></p><p> Baldur’s Gate 3 should run the moment you click<strong>Play</strong> , but in some cases, it might not. What you should do is find Baldur’s Gate 3 on the left side menu and<strong>Control</strong> -click (secondary-click) it to open the context menu. Go to<strong>Manage &gt; Browse Local Files</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/steam-context-menu-for-baldur-s-gate-3.jpeg"                      alt="Steam context menu for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3"                ></p><p> It will open up an old-looking Windows window with Baldur’s Gate 3’s files. Click the<strong>Bin</strong> folder and find<strong>BG3_DX11.exe</strong> and run the game from there. It should boot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/baldur-s-gate-3-in-game-character-creation-screen.jpg"                      alt="Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 in-game character creation screen"                ></p><p> You might run into issues, lagging, or crashes if you’re using a MacBook Air. You can try lowering the settings to see if it helps on a struggling computer. We highly recommend you leave Baldur’s Gate 3 full version alone if you’re using a MacBook Air. Instead, you should play early access; it’s pretty good and well-optimized for your machine.</p><h2 id="Join-the-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Adventure-Without-Waiting"><a href="#Join-the-Baldur’s-Gate-3-Adventure-Without-Waiting" class="headerlink" title="Join the Baldur’s Gate 3 Adventure Without Waiting"></a>Join the Baldur’s Gate 3 Adventure Without Waiting</h2><p> Use CrossOver to beat the clock and access Baldur’s Gate 3 ahead of time. And thanks to Steam’s syncing saves, you can continue right where you stopped on CrossOver when the game is finally out for macOS.</p><p> In case you didn’t know, Larian isn’t sure when exactly the game will be ready for macOS, even though it has stated September. So, it just might take longer than you expect. CrossOver might come in handy in the meantime.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Consider the features you’ll need in the future, and never assume you won’t need a warranty.</li></ul><p> With so many options available, finding a monitor that fits your needs and satisfies your wants is harder than ever. Once you figure out what you need, make sure to avoid the common issues that affect everyone buying a new monitor.</p><h2 id="1-Not-Considering-Your-Needs"><a href="#1-Not-Considering-Your-Needs" class="headerlink" title="1 Not Considering Your Needs"></a>1 Not Considering Your Needs</h2><p> One of the biggest mistakes shoppers make is not considering their specific needs before purchasing a monitor. Are you a gamer who needs a high refresh rate for smooth gameplay? A graphic designer who requires accurate color reproduction? A programmer who needs an ultrawide monitor? Or maybe you are a person who does a little bit of everything and is looking for a more general-purpose monitor.</p><p> Spending some time thinking of what you’ll primarily use the monitor for will guide you toward the right features and specifications your monitor should have.</p><h2 id="2-Getting-the-Wrong-Sized-Monitor-for-Your-Room"><a href="#2-Getting-the-Wrong-Sized-Monitor-for-Your-Room" class="headerlink" title="2 Getting the Wrong-Sized Monitor for Your Room"></a>2 Getting the Wrong-Sized Monitor for Your Room</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/valorant-game-running-on-an-oled-monitor-mounted-on-a-desk-with-keyboard-and-mouse-below.jpg"                      alt="Valorant game running on an OLED monitor mounted on a desk with keyboard and mouse below"                ></p><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Size matters when it comes to monitors, but bigger isn’t always better. Before settling on a screen size, consider the dimensions of your room or workspace. Different screen sizes will require different spacing between you and the monitor.</p><p> The bigger the monitor, the farther you’ll need to sit to view the entire screen comfortably. In contrast, the smaller the screen size, the nearer you’ll have to be so as not to strain your eyes. It’s easier to get a properly sized monitor for your room than to find a room that fits your monitor.</p><p> Take measurements and ensure the monitor fits comfortably in your environment.</p><h2 id="3-Forgetting-About-Ports"><a href="#3-Forgetting-About-Ports" class="headerlink" title="3 Forgetting About Ports"></a>3 Forgetting About Ports</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/muo-gaming-wii-tv-connection-av-hdmi-2023-3.jpg"                      alt="TV HDMI ports"                ></p><p> Ports are often overlooked but are essential for connectivity. Consider what devices you’ll connect to your monitor and ensure it has the necessary ports. Having the wrong ports on your monitor can cause performance issues—or worse, it won’t even work for your system.</p><p> For example, using <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/hdmi-vs-display-port-best-for-gaming/" >HDMI over DisplayPort for gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on an Nvidia gaming system because your monitor doesn’t have DisplayPort can lower gaming performance due to the lack of G-Sync support.</p><p> You may also want to think about future-proofing your setup by choosing a monitor with versatile ports that can accommodate system upgrades you plan to have in the future.</p><h2 id="4-Choosing-the-Wrong-Screen-Resolution"><a href="#4-Choosing-the-Wrong-Screen-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="4 Choosing the Wrong Screen Resolution"></a>4 Choosing the Wrong Screen Resolution</h2><p> While a larger screen can provide a more immersive experience, the resolution determines the clarity of the display. Don’t assume that a bigger screen automatically means a higher resolution. Consider the resolution that best suits your usage and ensures sharp image quality.</p><p> Of course, you don’t always have to have high resolutions for larger monitors. For example, programmers likely won’t have a problem using a 1080p ultrawide monitor so long as they can program and read the documentation.</p><h2 id="5-Focusing-Solely-on-Price"><a href="#5-Focusing-Solely-on-Price" class="headerlink" title="5 Focusing Solely on Price"></a>5 Focusing Solely on Price</h2><p> While budget constraints are understandable, focusing solely on price can lead to overlooking crucial features and sacrificing quality. Keep in mind that a cheaper monitor may cost you more in the long run if it lacks the features you need or has poor build quality.</p><p> Sometimes, a less expensive monitor might be a better fit for you. Sometimes, you don’t need all the extra features that more expensive monitors have. In fact, some features may be something you’ll want to avoid. For example, a cheaper QLED panel is better than a more expensive OLED in a place with lots of natural lighting.</p><p> Strike a balance between price and value to ensure you get the best bang for your buck.</p><h2 id="6-Failing-to-Understand-Common-Monitor-Specifications"><a href="#6-Failing-to-Understand-Common-Monitor-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="6 Failing to Understand Common Monitor Specifications"></a>6 Failing to Understand Common Monitor Specifications</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/commonly-confused-monitor-specs/" >Understanding common monitor specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as refresh rate, response time, and brightness is crucial for making an informed decision. These factors can significantly impact your viewing experience, especially if you’re a gamer or professional requiring precise color accuracy. Take the time to research and understand what each specification means for your usage.</p><h2 id="7-Falling-for-Marketing-Gimmicks"><a href="#7-Falling-for-Marketing-Gimmicks" class="headerlink" title="7 Falling for Marketing Gimmicks"></a>7 Falling for Marketing Gimmicks</h2><p> Don’t be swayed by flashy marketing gimmicks that add little to no value to your overall experience. Integrated speakers, RGB lighting, or fancy labels may seem enticing, but they often come at the expense of essential features or performance. Focus on functionality over aesthetics to ensure you get a monitor that meets your needs.</p><p> It’s not bad to have fancy lighting on your monitor, especially if you really like it. As long as you’ve set your budget and prioritized your needs first, getting the extras shouldn’t be a problem afterward.</p><h2 id="8-Ignoring-Ergonomic-Features"><a href="#8-Ignoring-Ergonomic-Features" class="headerlink" title="8 Ignoring Ergonomic Features"></a>8 Ignoring Ergonomic Features</h2><p> Ergonomic features play a significant role in ensuring comfort during extended use. Look for monitors with adjustable stands, tilt, swivel, and height options to customize your viewing experience.</p><p> Additionally, even if you’re currently fine with the stock monitor stand, consider whether it supports <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-vesa-mounting-standards/#:~:text=One%20such%20standard%20is%20the,fit%20across%20different%20display%20mounts." >VESA mounting and what VESA standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it uses. Having the option to VESA mount your monitor will ensure more flexible setups that may interest you in the future.</p><h2 id="9-Not-Checking-Reviews-and-User-Feedback"><a href="#9-Not-Checking-Reviews-and-User-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="9 Not Checking Reviews and User Feedback"></a>9 Not Checking Reviews and User Feedback</h2><p> Before purchasing, read reviews and user feedback to get a sense of real-world experiences. Pay attention to both positive and negative reviews to gauge the monitor’s strengths and weaknesses. This will help you make a more informed decision and avoid potential pitfalls.</p><h2 id="10-Not-Checking-for-Warranty-and-Support"><a href="#10-Not-Checking-for-Warranty-and-Support" class="headerlink" title="10 Not Checking for Warranty and Support"></a>10 Not Checking for Warranty and Support</h2><p> Finally, don’t overlook the importance of warranty and support when purchasing a monitor. Even the most reputable brands can encounter issues, so having reliable warranty coverage and access to timely support can save you from headaches down the line. Prioritize monitors with robust warranty options and reputable customer service.</p><p> When possible, you’ll want to have both a manufacturer’s warranty and a store warranty. If you can only have a warranty from the manufacturer, make sure that the store you buy your monitor from is an official distributor of that manufacturer.</p><p> Additionally, buying a monitor from a physical store near you may actually be better than buying a slightly discounted one online. Often, visiting a physical store to return or service your monitor is less of a hassle than shipping your monitor to an online store, which may take significantly longer to process.</p><p> By avoiding these common mistakes and taking the time to research and evaluate your options, you can ensure that you end up with a monitor that meets your needs and provides an enjoyable viewing experience for years to come.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-crash-landings-fixing-windows-based-epic-games-problems/"><u>Avoid Crash Landings: Fixing Windows-Based Epic Games Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-se-to-the-previous-ios-system-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone SE to the Previous iOS System Version?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Avoid-Crash-Landings-Fixing-Windows-Based-Epic-Games-Problems"><a href="#Avoid-Crash-Landings-Fixing-Windows-Based-Epic-Games-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Crash Landings: Fixing Windows-Based Epic Games Problems"></a>Avoid Crash Landings: Fixing Windows-Based Epic Games Problems</h2><p> The Epic Games Launcher serves as the central hub for launching and managing all your games bought or downloaded from the Epic Store. However, you can’t do any of that if the Epic Games Launcher keeps freezing or crashing on your Windows computer.</p><p> If you are facing a similar issue, this guide contains some troubleshooting tips that will help.</p><h2 id="1-Close-the-Epic-Games-Launcher-Completely-and-Reopen-It"><a href="#1-Close-the-Epic-Games-Launcher-Completely-and-Reopen-It" class="headerlink" title="1. Close the Epic Games Launcher Completely and Reopen It"></a>1. Close the Epic Games Launcher Completely and Reopen It</h2><p> The Epic Games Launcher may freeze on your Windows PC due to malfunctioning or unresponsive app processes. In most cases, you can resolve the issue by closing the Epic Games Launcher completely and then reopening it. Hence, it’s the first thing you should try.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/" >open the Task Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Locate and select<strong>EpicGamesLauncher</strong> on the list.</li><li>Click the<strong>End task</strong> option at the top.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/close-epic-games-launcher.jpg"                      alt="Close Epic Games Launcher"                ></li></ol><p>Reopen the Epic Games Launcher and try using it.</p><h2 id="2-Run-Epic-Games-Launcher-as-an-Administrator"><a href="#2-Run-Epic-Games-Launcher-as-an-Administrator" class="headerlink" title="2. Run Epic Games Launcher as an Administrator"></a>2. Run Epic Games Launcher as an Administrator</h2><p> Running the Epic Games Launcher with admin rights can help you avoid any issues caused by a lack of relevant permissions to access system files and settings. Right-click on the<strong>Epic Games Launcher</strong> shortcut and select<strong>Run as administrator</strong> . Select<strong>Yes</strong> when the UAC (User Account Control) prompt appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/run-epic-games-launcher-as-admin.jpg"                      alt="Run Epic Games Launcher as Admin"                ></p><p> If this method gets Epic Games Launcher to operate smoothly, you can configure it to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ways-to-run-a-program-as-administrator-in-windows/" >always run as an administrator on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-Epic-Games-Server-Status"><a href="#3-Check-the-Epic-Games-Server-Status" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the Epic Games Server Status"></a>3. Check the Epic Games Server Status</h2><p> Issues with Epic Games servers can also cause its launcher to misbehave on your Windows PC. You should <a class="link"   href="https://status.epicgames.com/" >check Epic Games server status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to ensure they are operating smoothly.</p><p> If there’s an issue with the servers, you have no option but to wait for the company to resolve the problem on its end. Following that, you should be able to use Epic Games Launcher as before.</p><h2 id="4-Check-for-App-Updates"><a href="#4-Check-for-App-Updates" class="headerlink" title="4. Check for App Updates"></a>4. Check for App Updates</h2><p> Using an outdated version of Epic Games Launcher can also cause it to crash or freeze on Windows. Hence, it’s a good idea to update the Epic Games Launcher if you haven’t already. Here are the steps for the same.</p><ol><li>Launch Epic Games Launcher on your computer.</li><li>Click your<strong>profile icon</strong> in the top right corner and choose<strong>Settings</strong> from the list.</li><li>If a newer version is available, click the<strong>Restart and Update</strong> button that appears.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/restart-update.jpg"                      alt="Restart &amp; Update option in Epic Games Launcher"                ></li></ol><h2 id="5-Disable-Fullscreen-Optimizations"><a href="#5-Disable-Fullscreen-Optimizations" class="headerlink" title="5. Disable Fullscreen Optimizations"></a>5. Disable Fullscreen Optimizations</h2><p> Enabling full-screen optimizations for an app on Windows can boost its performance in full-screen mode. However, this feature can sometimes cause compatibility issues, leading to abrupt app crashes. You can try disabling full-screen optimizations for the Epic Games Launcher to see if that restores normalcy.</p><ol><li>Close the Epic Games Launcher using Task Manager.</li><li>Right-click on the<strong>Epic Games Launcher</strong> shortcut and select<strong>Properties</strong> .</li><li>Switch to the<strong>Compatiblity</strong> tab.</li><li>Clear the<strong>Disable fullscreen optimizations</strong> checkbox.</li><li>Hit<strong>Apply</strong> followed by<strong>OK</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/disable-fullscreen-optimizations-for-epic-games-launcher.jpg"                      alt="Disable Fullscreen Optimizations for Epic Games Launcher"                ></li></ol><h2 id="6-Clear-the-Epic-Games-Launcher’s-Webcache-Folder"><a href="#6-Clear-the-Epic-Games-Launcher’s-Webcache-Folder" class="headerlink" title="6. Clear the Epic Games Launcher’s Webcache Folder"></a>6. Clear the Epic Games Launcher’s Webcache Folder</h2><p> Epic Games Launcher, like any other program, creates cache files on your PC to load content faster and improve its performance. However, once this data becomes old or corrupted, it hurts more than it helps. When this happens, Epic Games Launcher may become unresponsive or crash on your Windows PC.</p><p> You can try clearing the existing cache data associated with Epic Games Launcher to fix the problem. To do so, use these steps:</p><ol><li>Right-click the<strong>Start</strong> icon on the taskbar to open the Power User menu.</li><li>Select<strong>Run</strong> from the list.</li><li>Type**%localappdata%** in the Open field and click<strong>OK</strong> .</li><li>Navigate to<strong>EpicGamesLauncher &gt; Saved</strong> folder.</li><li>Locate and select<strong>webcache</strong> folders.</li><li>Click the<strong>trash icon</strong> at the top to delete them.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/delete-epic-games-launcher-cache.jpg"                      alt="Delete Epic Games Launcher Cache"                ></li></ol><h2 id="7-Fix-the-D3DCOMPILER-43-dll-File"><a href="#7-Fix-the-D3DCOMPILER-43-dll-File" class="headerlink" title="7. Fix the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll File"></a>7. Fix the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll File</h2><p> Do you see the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll error when Epic Games Launcher crashes on Windows? If so, the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll file on your PC may be corrupt or missing. Here’s what you can do to fix it.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + E</strong> to open File Explorer.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>C: &gt; Windows &gt; SysWOW64</strong> .</li><li>Locate the<strong>D3DCOMPILER_43</strong> file and delete it.</li><li>Head to <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35" >Microsoft’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/delete-the-d3dcompiler_43-dll-file.jpg"                      alt="Delete the D3DCOMPILER_43.dll File"                ></li></ol><p> Run the installer file and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process. After that, try using Epic Games Launcher again.</p><h2 id="8-Repair-the-Epic-Games-Launcher"><a href="#8-Repair-the-Epic-Games-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="8. Repair the Epic Games Launcher"></a>8. Repair the Epic Games Launcher</h2><p> Your Windows PC includes an app repair feature that can help you fix such issues with the Epic Games Launcher without affecting its data. You can try using this feature to see if that gets the Epic Games Launcher to run smoothly.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + S</strong> to open the search menu.</li><li>Type in<strong>control panel</strong> in the box and select the first result that appears.</li><li>Click on<strong>Programs and Features</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Epic Games Launcher</strong> on the list.</li><li>Click the<strong>Repair</strong> button at the top.</li><li>Select<strong>Yes</strong> when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/repair-epic-games-launcher.jpg"                      alt="Repair Epic Games Launcher"                ></li></ol><p> Follow the on-screen instructions to repair the launcher and try using it again.</p><h2 id="9-Reinstall-the-Epic-Games-Launcher"><a href="#9-Reinstall-the-Epic-Games-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="9. Reinstall the Epic Games Launcher"></a>9. Reinstall the Epic Games Launcher</h2><p> If repairing the Epic Games Launcher proves ineffective, you can try reinstalling it on your system.

They both have different companies behind them, but what really sets them apart? The short answer is DRM—but there’s more to it than just that.</p><h2 id="What’s-the-General-Difference-Between-Steam-and-GOG"><a href="#What’s-the-General-Difference-Between-Steam-and-GOG" class="headerlink" title="What’s the General Difference Between Steam and GOG?"></a>What’s the General Difference Between Steam and GOG?</h2><p> For those who don’t know, both Steam and GOG Galaxy are game launchers. Essentially, they are applications for organizing games on your computer. You can manually add games you have already installed or you can buy and download games from their in-app stores.</p><p> Steam is owned by Valve Corporation. Meanwhile, CD Projekt owns GOG (and its game launcher, GOG Galaxy). The unique visions and goals of these companies shape the direction of each game launcher and store. For example, GOG has a focus on providing DRM-free games.</p><p> Therefore, you’re more likely to see a focus on older RPG-like games on GOG compared to the broader selection on Steam.</p><p> However, Steam is the most popular PC game launcher and storefront, with over 50 million daily active users.</p><h2 id="1-DRM-Policies-and-User-Restrictions"><a href="#1-DRM-Policies-and-User-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="1. DRM Policies and User Restrictions"></a>1. DRM Policies and User Restrictions</h2><p> The number one selling point for GOG is its DRM-free policy. For those who don’t know,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-drm-and-why-does-it-exist-if-its-so-evil/" >DRM stands for digital rights management <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s usually used in the gaming world to refer to the strong restrictions that come with purchasing a game.</p><p> For instance, buying a game on Steam doesn’t mean you own it; you’re simply buying a license to play it through your Steam account. That means some games with third-party DRM systems, like Denuvo, require you to log in every few weeks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-09-at-6-12-05-pm.png"                      alt="GIG&#39;s DRM policy on GOG Galaxy"                ></p><p> GOG doesn’t believe in that. You can do whatever you want with a game that’s installed on your PC, and you can choose to remain offline as long as you want without losing access to any pre-downloaded content.</p><p> You can also log in to your GOG account on however many computers you want and download your purchased game. If you want, you can skip the GOG Galaxy launcher completely and download a game directly from GOG.com through a browser.</p><p> In contrast, Steam allows only one game session per account. This means that only one computer can access your Steam library at a given time, and you can’t run two sessions of the same game simultaneously. Additionally, the only way to download a Steam game is through Steam’s desktop client.</p><p> While GOG’s DRM-free policies are great for people with unreliable internet and gamers who worry about DRM’s privacy implications, they may also foster piracy and illegal game-sharing. Both sides have good arguments, and you should choose where to buy your games based on your preference.</p><h2 id="2-Game-Catalog-and-Exclusives"><a href="#2-Game-Catalog-and-Exclusives" class="headerlink" title="2. Game Catalog and Exclusives"></a>2. Game Catalog and Exclusives</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-11-20-40-am.png"                      alt="Steam&#39;s store catalog"                ></p><p> Due to Steam’s popularity, it features a larger library than GOG. Statista reports that Steam has about 70,000 games available in the store, while GOG has only about 9,000.</p><p> But when you examine the quality of titles, you’ll see that GOG comes ahead with better value and more comprehensive indexing. But you’re more likely to get newer releases on Steam before they get to GOG.</p><p> When it comes to exclusives, the parameters for judging are a little unfair—especially if we’re comparing exclusives the same way you’d compare them in console versus PC gaming. Since Steam has a much larger library and is the default platform of release for so many PC-serving publishers and indie developers, it’s chock-full of thousands of games that no other platform has.</p><p> Remember, though, that there are also many low-quality titles. However, Steam still has some major titles that GOG doesn’t, like GTA V (for AAA games) and Dave the Diver (for indie games).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-09-at-3-08-18-pm.png"                      alt="Diablo + Hellfire for sale on GOG"                ></p><p> In turn, GOG specializes in bringing back old games for modern machines. For instance, GOG is the only platform (apart from Blizzard’s very own launcher, Battle.net) that sells digital copies of Diablo: Hellfire, the 1997 Diablo expansion pack. Also, it’s the easiest place to get the digital version of the iconic Mortal Kombat 4, first released in 1998.</p><p> If you want an old game, you should check GOG first; GOG is an abbreviation for “good old games”, after all.</p><p> If you need to carry along save progress through cloud saves, both platforms offer them in games that support them.</p><p> There is one aspect of Steam’s game library that GOG can’t compete against: virtual reality. Steam has a dedicated VR section where you can get all the most popular VR games. It even has a special Steam app called SteamVR that allows you to access VR titles on supported headsets.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="3-UI-and-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-UI-and-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. UI and Ease of Use"></a>3. UI and Ease of Use</h2><p> Now that you know what games you can get from Steam and GOG and how you can use them, the next differentiator is how the launchers and storefronts look.</p><p> The Steam desktop client was released in 2003 and slowly evolved its iconic banner, website-like style, and top-menu layout to the app we see today. It still pays strong homage to its original look, which can sometimes make it unintuitive to use.</p><p> However, it’s a powerful and robust app and it has been frequently updated over the past two decades to get to where it is.</p><p> GOG Galaxy is newer, debuting as a desktop client in 2014. It’s more lightweight than Steam and, therefore, easier to navigate. The downside is that it’s not as robust, and it lacks many social and customer experience features that Steam has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-11-26-03-am.png"                      alt="Adding a game manually on GOG Galaxy"                ></p><p> When it comes to important things, such as buying a game or adding a pre-existing game to your library, the user experience varies. While it requires fewer clicks and less searching to buy a game on GOG, it also doesn’t have any options to send a game to a friend.</p><p> On the flip side, adding a game you didn’t buy on Steam is easier. All you have to do is click<strong>Add a Game</strong> in the bottom-right corner of the client and choose an executable file in your PC’s file browser. GOG Galaxy forces you to search for the game on its platform, mark it as owned, and then link an executable.</p><h2 id="4-Community-Features-and-Social-Integration"><a href="#4-Community-Features-and-Social-Integration" class="headerlink" title="4. Community Features and Social Integration"></a>4. Community Features and Social Integration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-11-28-28-am.png"                      alt="Friends page on Stean"                ></p><p> Another important angle to consider when analyzing these two platforms’ differences is their community features. Many people agree that playing games is much more interesting with other people. That’s why both GOG and Steam allow you to add friends.</p><p> You can earn and show off achievements on both platforms. They also support crossplay, and you can get GOG Galaxy and Steam on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Each game launcher also has provisions for user-awarded ratings and reviews.</p><p> However, Steam has a larger user base and all the benefits that come with it. Steam offers online communities for your favorite games, community-made mods to download, and trading cards you can sell to add to your Steam wallet.</p><p> In short, it has the most robust game forum on the internet. You can also easily buy games as gifts and send the key or the game itself to a friend. These are some of the reasons why some argue that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/all-gamers-should-use-steam-reasons-why/" >all gamers should use Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Customer-Support-Effectiveness-and-Refund-Policies"><a href="#5-Customer-Support-Effectiveness-and-Refund-Policies" class="headerlink" title="5. Customer Support Effectiveness and Refund Policies"></a>5. Customer Support Effectiveness and Refund Policies</h2><p> The final facet separating these two platforms is how they treat distressed customers. We’re not saying any of these are better than the other, but they have different approaches—especially refund policies.</p><p> According to MUO’s tests, both GOG and Steam have similar ticket response times. Many other users also have mostly positive remarks about how the customer support team deals with their issues.</p><p> Regarding refunds, Steam has a famous two-hour&#x2F;14-day approach. This means that you must have played the game for less than two hours and owned it for less than 14 days (counting starts on the release date for preorders).</p><p> It’s also an easy process and you can see the steps in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-a-game-on-steam/" >how to refund a game on Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Steam has a fast refund process, which seems automated if you meet the requirements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-10-at-11-40-57-am.png"                      alt="Steam Support&#39;s refund option on the web"                ></p><p> GOG’s refund process is similar. However, it takes a longer time for your money to return. This is especially true if you choose to get the money back through your payment source instead of the wallet. In that case, you should allow up to 30 days. GOG’s slower refund process might be due to manual approvals.</p><p> All in all, there’s no reason to stick to only one of these. They seem to be designed to work interchangeably, and many gamers, including me, use both. You can integrate your Steam account into GOG Galaxy and launch all your Steam games there. You can also take advantage of sales on both platforms and enjoy Steam’s packages and GOG’s DRM-free policies at the same time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-diving-deep-the-intricacies-of-the-mukbang-phenomenon/"><u>2024 Approved  Diving Deep  The Intricacies of the Mukbang Phenomenon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-these-6-pitfalls-with-intels-upcoming-chips/"><u>Avoid These 6 Pitfalls with Intel's Upcoming Chips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/androids-gateway-to-segas-dreamcatcher-era/"><u>Android's Gateway to Sega's Dreamcatcher Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-game-hits-without-an-internet-connection-ios/"><u>Best Game Hits Without an Internet Connection (iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships - Top 16 on Xbox Series S/X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/excellence-range-highest-quality-webcam-grips-for-2024/"><u>Excellence Range  Highest Quality Webcam Grips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-fsr-3-launch-challenger-to-nvidias-dynamic-super-sampling/"><u>AMD's FSR 3 Launch: Challenger to NVIDIA's Dynamic Super Sampling?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoid-buyers-remorse-with-pc-compatibility-checks/"><u>Avoid Buyer's Remorse with PC Compatibility Checks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/under-the-lens-hero-4-meets-hero-5/"><u>Under the Lens  Hero 4 Meets Hero 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/realme-messages-recovery-recover-deleted-messages-from-realme-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Realme Messages Recovery - Recover Deleted Messages from Realme</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-up-your-image-game-the-best-free-online-editors/"><u>In 2024, Step Up Your Image Game  The Best Free Online Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-move-custom-ringtones-from-apple-iphone-se-to-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Move Custom Ringtones from Apple iPhone SE to Android?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="AI-Clues-to-Crack-Virtual-Crime-Scenes"><a href="#AI-Clues-to-Crack-Virtual-Crime-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes"></a>AI Clues to Crack Virtual Crime Scenes</h2><p> Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marple had it easy. You see, when they encountered a murder mystery, they only ever had to deal with the logic of a human mind and the complexities of a human heart. But what if the murder was masterminded by artificial intelligence?</p><p> With the advent of ChatGPT and other such AI models comes a series of websites and apps that level up a traditional murder mystery game. In some, you’ll be able to interact and talk with suspects for a single mystery. In others, the AI generates a new mystery every time you visit. The game is afoot!</p><h2 id="1-Solve-the-Murders"><a href="#1-Solve-the-Murders" class="headerlink" title="1. Solve the Murders"></a>1. Solve the Murders</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-solve-the-murders.jpg"                      alt="In Solve the Murders, you play a detective who has chat with AI suspects in a murder mystery to find out who the killer is"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> Solve the Murders is based on a similar large language model as ChatGPT, where you play a detective who has to solve the murder mystery by chatting with AI-generated bots. At the start, you’ll be given a list of facts about the murder and the players involved.</p><p> You will need to ask suspects and police officers a series of questions. Uniquely, suspects are allowed to lie to you, but they will tell more truth as you learn more facts and can counter-examine them. Each fact you discover gives you one point, which you can use for other resources in the game. All facts are automatically added to the “Discovered Facts” ledger that you can check at any time.</p><p> The points you earn are tradable for a few acts, such as checking alibis, checking records, investigating scenes, and tailing suspects. If you’re stuck at any time, you can spend points to get a clue on how you should proceed. Once you’re sure about the whodunnit, use the one-time “Solve the murder” action to see if you got it right.</p><h2 id="2-Gron"><a href="#2-Gron" class="headerlink" title="2. Gron"></a>2. Gron</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-gron-town.jpg"                      alt="Gron is a retro 8-bit RPG-style online game where you unravel a murder mystery by finding evidence and clues, as well as interrogating suspects with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> You already know that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompts-to-develop-book-characters/" >ChatGPT can create fictional characters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to talk with or let you chat with existing famous characters once the right data is fed. Gron leverages this power to make a murder mystery game like an old-school 8-bit RPG.</p><p> You play as Detective Samuel O’Connor, called to investigate the suspicious death of Elias Harrington, one of the wealthiest men in San Francisco. You’ll need to move around in the game using the arrow keys and interact with characters or objects using the Spacebar. The game gives you no indication that a character or object is important, so it’s all about using your detective skills.</p><p> When you interact with a character, Gron automatically starts a chat window. Knowing the right prompts and asking the right questions is important. For example, we asked a character if he is the only son and got an affirmative response, but when asked if he had any siblings, he quickly replied that he misunderstood the first question and he had a sister. As you ask more questions, use the in-game diary to record responses so that you can cross-reference different testimonies to deduce who the murderer is.</p><h2 id="3-Mystery-o-Matic"><a href="#3-Mystery-o-Matic" class="headerlink" title="3. Mystery-o-Matic"></a>3. Mystery-o-Matic</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-mystery-o-matic.jpg"                      alt="Mystery-o-matic uses AI like ChatGPT to generate a new murder mystery every day where you have to guess the killer, the weapon, and the location based on a set of clues"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> Move over,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-wordle-alternatives/" >Wordle and its alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s a new daily puzzle, and lives are at stake! Mystery-o-Matic generates a new murder mystery every day using machine-learning algorithms. It uses a few base elements and then creates permutations and combinations that set up a daily mystery.</p><p> The wording on the site isn’t crystal clear, so here’s the explanation. There are three people (Alice, Eddie, and Carol), one of whom will be murdered. There are four rooms (kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom), and you’ll have to pay attention to the daily layout to see how the rooms are connected. Any character can move from one room to another in 15 minutes, but not two rooms in 15 minutes. You’ll also be told about four possible murder weapons (knife, gun, poison, rope) and where they were located. Finally, you’ll get a few statements from the three characters involved or based on what the police found.</p><p> Use the built-in investigator’s notebook to figure out who was in which room at what time and how they could have accessed a murder weapon. Once you’re sure about the solution, say who the murderer was, the weapon was, and the time of the murder. The game might get a little repetitive the longer you play it, but hey, where else would you get to solve a murder mystery daily?</p><h2 id="4-Murdle"><a href="#4-Murdle" class="headerlink" title="4. Murdle"></a>4. Murdle</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ai-chatgpt-murder-mystery-online-games-play-detective-murdle.jpg"                      alt="Murdle offers a new murder mystery everyday, generated by an AI and written by Hollywood mystery writer G. T. Karber, increasing in difficulty from Monday to Sunday"                ></p><p> Author Screenshot by Mihir Patkar - No attribution required</p><p> Hollywood mystery writer G. T. Karber offers one new murder mystery logic puzzle daily at his website Murdle. The long-running successful website has already led to three books of murder mysteries, written by Karber and generated by “Moriarty”, a proprietary algorithm capable of planning a million murders a minute.</p><p> Murdle follows a similar system to Mystery-o-Matic, giving you three or four suspects, three or four locations, and three or four murder weapons every day. The mysteries get more difficult with each day, with Monday being the easiest and Sunday requiring the skills of Sherlock Holmes.</p><p> You play as Detective Logico and are given a series of clues and evidence, which you can use with the cross-referencing charting to match suspects, locations, and weapons. It’s best to start off with the mini-Murdle tutorial and then get to the daily puzzles. When you’re ready to make your accusation, you’ll need to say who the murderer was, how they did it, and where the ghastly act took place.</p><h2 id="Create-Your-Own-ChatGPT-Murder-Mystery"><a href="#Create-Your-Own-ChatGPT-Murder-Mystery" class="headerlink" title="Create Your Own ChatGPT Murder Mystery"></a>Create Your Own ChatGPT Murder Mystery</h2><p> Yes, you can create a murder mystery game with ChatGPT by yourself. These murder mystery apps relieve you of the burden of giving the AI base information and data and then figuring out the best prompts to have it generate a mystery. But if you’re willing to learn those skills, you can soon set up a few templates of your own and construct a custom ChatGPT mystery.</p><p> A good place to learn how to set up these prompts is Reddit. On r&#x2F;ChatGPT, you’ll find posts like creating a murder mystery with the characters of the sitcom Friends or the mystery inspired by the game Clue. How cool would it be to play a murder mystery based on your favorite fictional characters?</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/the-professionals-way-of-removing-backgrounds-for-2024/"><u>The Professional's Way of Removing Backgrounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships - Top 16 on Xbox Series S/X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-storytelling-with-style-making-instagram-text-dance/"><u>2024 Approved  Storytelling with Style  Making Instagram Text Dance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/alternative-methods-for-a-quick-ps5-startup/"><u>Alternative Methods for a Quick PS5 Startup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/precision-in-proportion-finding-aspect-ratio-perfection-for-2024/"><u>Precision in Proportion  Finding Aspect Ratio Perfection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/expertly-choosing-the-best-online-volume-amplifiers-for-your-videos-and-streams-for-2024/"><u>Expertly Choosing the Best Online Volume Amplifiers for Your Videos and Streams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/approach-for-resolving-components-needed-fault/"><u>Approach for Resolving Components Needed Fault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-companion-accessories-for-steam-deck-24/"><u>Best Companion Accessories for Steam Deck '24</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/new-breathtaking-4k-moments-you-wont-want-to-miss/"><u>New Breathtaking 4K Moments You Wont Want to Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoiding-overheat-gaming-card-temperature-tips/"><u>Avoiding Overheat: Gaming Card Temperature Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/balancing-steam-sensation-with-child-safety/"><u>Balancing Steam Sensation with Child Safety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-zero-price-virtual-gatherings-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Zero-Price Virtual Gatherings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-game-hits-without-an-internet-connection-ios/"><u>Best Game Hits Without an Internet Connection (iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-driven-virtual-whodunnit-adventures/"><u>AI-Driven Virtual Whodunnit Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-oppo-a18-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/"><u>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Oppo A18 Phone?

You can also determine whether kids can browse the Steam store, view community-generated content, chat with other Steam users, or access your profile information.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-Family-View-on-Steam"><a href="#How-to-Enable-Family-View-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable Family View on Steam"></a>How to Enable Family View on Steam</h2><p> Your first step is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-steam-how-to-install/" >download and install the Steam client <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There are clients available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS.</p><p> Next, sign into your Steam account.

Then scroll down to the<strong>Family</strong> tab on the left side of the window that pops up. Under<strong>Family View</strong> , click<strong>Manage</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/steam-family-view-settings.png"                      alt="Steam desktop client displaying the &#39;Family View&#39; option"                ></p><p> A wizard will pop up that will guide you through the remainder of the process. The steps include selecting which games you want to provide access to and setting up your PIN.</p><p> Whenever you want to provide your kids with more games in the future, you will need to repeat these steps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/steam-family-view-games.png"                      alt="Steam displaying games you&#39;ve granted access to in Family View"                ></p><p> You may find that you eventually run out of space.

If this icon is green, it means Family View is active.</p><p>Click this icon, then enter your PIN, to exit Family View.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/steam-family-view-exit.png"                      alt="The prompt to exit Steam Family View"                ></p><p> Click this icon again whenever you want to re-enable Family View.

Steam Family View restricts the games available on your computer, which makes it ideal for children who do not have separate devices of their own.</p><p> It can also come in handy if multiple family members want to get the most out of a single gaming rig. After all, you can provide access to your entire library of games and merely prevent family members from chatting under your name and placing additional purchases.</p><p> If you want to share games across devices, then you will want to consider Steam Family Sharing instead. Steam Family Sharing is also a good way to share your games with friends, even if they live far away.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-checklist-for-virtual-vigilance-safeguarding-during-online-interactions/"><u>New The Ultimate Checklist for Virtual Vigilance Safeguarding During Online Interactions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-and-gaming-the-revolution-of-nvidias-dlss-technology-in-update-35/"><u>AI and Gaming: The Revolution of Nvidia’s DLSS Technology in Update 3.5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-contacts-from-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-to-outlook-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Contacts from Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro to Outlook | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/androids-gateway-to-segas-dreamcatcher-era/"><u>Android's Gateway to Sega's Dreamcatcher Era</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-fsr-3-launch-challenger-to-nvidias-dynamic-super-sampling/"><u>AMD's FSR 3 Launch: Challenger to NVIDIA's Dynamic Super Sampling?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/unlocking-aspect-ratios-the-key-to-facebook-video-success/"><u>Unlocking Aspect Ratios  The Key to Facebook Video Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-chords-to-chart-toppers-essential-musician-focused-youtube-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Chords to Chart-Toppers  Essential Musician-Focused YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/opmobile-techniques-for-sound-rate-manipulation-in-youtube/"><u>Desktop/Mobile Techniques for Sound Rate Manipulation in YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-up-your-game-mastering-discord-message-embellishments/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step Up Your Game  Mastering Discord Message Embellishments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships -

These chips are supposedly the best, most power-efficient Intel offers, but many are disappointed with its performance.</p><p> So, if you’re an Intel fan, here is why you should skip the 14th-Gen processors and perhaps wait for the 15th-Generation instead.</p><h2 id="1-Intel’s-14th-Gen-Brings-Minimal-Specification-Upgrades-Over-13th-Gen-Chips"><a href="#1-Intel’s-14th-Gen-Brings-Minimal-Specification-Upgrades-Over-13th-Gen-Chips" class="headerlink" title="1.

Intel’s 14th-Gen Brings Minimal Specification Upgrades Over 13th-Gen Chips</h2><p> One of the reasons why you would upgrade to a processor is that it has a significant advantage over the one you have. However, if you have a 13th-Gen Intel processor or newer, the latest 14th-Gen chips do not offer a big advantage, especially if you stay in the same Core variant you currently have,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/intel-core-i3-vs-i5-vs-i7-one-really-need/" >like the Intel Core i5 or i7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Let’s compare the specifications from the latest three Intel Core i9 generations to see their differences.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Processor</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i9-14900K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i9-13900K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i9-12900K</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Max Turbo Frequency</strong></td><td>6.0 GHz</td><td>6.0 GHz</td><td>5.2 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor Cores (P-Cores + E-Cores)</strong></td><td>24 (8P + 16E)</td><td>24 (8P + 16E)</td><td>16 (8P + 8E)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Processor Threads</strong></td><td>32</td><td>32</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Smart Cache (L3)</strong></td><td>36 MB</td><td>36 MB</td><td>30 MB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Memory Speed</strong></td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-5600</td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-4800</td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-4800</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PCIe 5.0 Lanes</strong></td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PCIe 4.0 Lanes</strong></td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Integrated Graphics</strong></td><td>Intel UHD 770</td><td>Intel UHD 770</td><td>Intel UHD 770</td></tr></tbody></table><p> While Intel’s 14th-Gen has some advantage over the 12th-Generation chips in core counts and max frequency, its only advantage over the 13th-Gen is it’s slightly faster maximum memory speed with DDR5 RAM.</p><p> We can also check the differences between the more affordable Intel Core i5 Generations.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Processor</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i5-14600K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i5-13600K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i5-12600K</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Max Turbo Frequency</strong></td><td>5.3 GHz</td><td>5.1 GHz</td><td>4.9 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor Cores (P-Cores + E-Cores)</strong></td><td>14 (6P + 8E)</td><td>14 (6P + 8E)</td><td>10 (6P + 4E)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Processor Threads</strong></td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Smart Cache (L3)</strong></td><td>24 MB</td><td>24 MB</td><td>20 MB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Memory Speed</strong></td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-5600</td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-4800</td><td>DDR4-3200 DDR5-4800</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PCIe 5.0 Lanes</strong></td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PCIe 4.0 Lanes</strong></td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Integrated Graphics</strong></td><td>Intel UHD 770</td><td>Intel UHD 730</td><td>Intel UHD 730</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Even the entry-level Core i5 processors have few changes over the 13th-Generation chips.</p><h2 id="2-Intel’s-14th-Gen-and-13th-Gen-i9-and-i5-Processors-Have-the-Same-Core-Count"><a href="#2-Intel’s-14th-Gen-and-13th-Gen-i9-and-i5-Processors-Have-the-Same-Core-Count" class="headerlink" title="2.

In general,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/processor-core-makeuseof-explains-2/" >the processor core <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the part of your computer that reads and executes instructions.</p><p> So, the more cores you have, the faster your processor will run.

Intel took this further by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/intel-cpus-explained-what-are-e-cores-and-p-cores/" >integrating performance and efficiency cores <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> into its chips to have a powerful but power-efficient processor.</p><p> However, if you look at our comparison charts above for the 13th-Gen and 14th-Gen chips, you’ll see that the i9 and i5 processors have the same number of cores. Only the Intel Core i7-14700K gets a core count bump from 16 (8P + 8E) to 20 cores (8P + 12E).</p><h2 id="3-The-13th-Gen-and-14th-Gen-Intel-Chips-Use-the-Same-Architecture"><a href="#3-The-13th-Gen-and-14th-Gen-Intel-Chips-Use-the-Same-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="3.

Major architecture changes can be a game changer, making a processor more powerful and efficient. This is most apparent with the 12th-Gen Alder Lake processor when Intel introduced the performance and efficiency cores in its chips.</p><p> One of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-intel-raptor-lake/" >things you need to know about the 13th-Gen Raptor Lake processor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that it’s mostly an improvement over the 12th-Gen Alder Lake processors. But the 14th-Generation Intel chips are also an improvement built upon the Raptor Lake processor.</p><p> Even <a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/core.html" >Intel says this <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as it called the 14th-Generation processors “Raptor Lake Refresh”. Nevertheless, let us see the results from various testers to see how the 14th-Gen Intel chips fare over other processors.</p><h2 id="4-They-Don’t-Perform-Much-Better-Than-the-13th-Gen-Intel-Chips"><a href="#4-They-Don’t-Perform-Much-Better-Than-the-13th-Gen-Intel-Chips" class="headerlink" title="4. They Don’t Perform Much Better Than the 13th-Gen Intel Chips"></a>4. They Don’t Perform Much Better Than the 13th-Gen Intel Chips</h2><p> Of course, no matter what a processor maker says, the best way to gauge a chip’s performance is to see its real-world results. So, this is how the 14th-Generation Intel processors performed over 13th-Gen Intel chips and from competing AMD offerings.</p><p> First, let’s look at Gamer Nexus’s test of the Intel Core i9-14900K, linked above. Gamer Nexus used a computer with the following specifications for the test: RTX 4090 Strix GPU and DDR5-6000 Corsair RAM.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Intel Core i9-14900K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i9-13900K</strong></th><th><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Productivity Testing</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blender 3.64 Rendering (seconds &#x2F; lower is better)</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.3</td><td>6.7</td></tr><tr><td>7-Zip Compression Test (millions of instructions per second &#x2F; higher is better)</td><td>190,613.3</td><td>189,432.5</td><td>194,953.5</td></tr><tr><td>Adobe Premiere (Puget Suite aggregate score &#x2F; higher is better)</td><td>842</td><td>828</td><td>832</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game Testing (Average FPS&#x2F;Higher Is Better)</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Six Siege @ 1080p</td><td>655.9</td><td>645.2</td><td>694.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Six Siege @ 1440p</td><td>511.2</td><td>511.0</td><td>520.0</td></tr><tr><td>F1 2023 @ 1080p</td><td>422.1</td><td>417.5</td><td>506.5</td></tr><tr><td>F1 2023 @ 1440p</td><td>392.8</td><td>389.5</td><td>400.1</td></tr><tr><td>Baldur’s Gate 3 @ 1080p</td><td>110.2</td><td>107.8</td><td>124.9</td></tr><tr><td>Baldur’s Gate 3 @ 1440p</td><td>107.6</td><td>106.0</td><td>121.7</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fantasy XIV @ 1080p</td><td>270.0</td><td>262.0</td><td>214.2</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fantasy XIV @ 1440p</td><td>269.0</td><td>261.8</td><td>212.6</td></tr><tr><td>Starfield @ 1080p</td><td>132.4</td><td>128.8</td><td>114.0</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see in the test results, the Intel i9-14900K performs a bit better than its previous-generation counterparts. However, in many tests, AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950X3D chip posted better results than Intel’s 13th-Gen and 14th-Gen offerings. Despite the 14900K boasting more cores and a higher boost clock speed,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/amd-3d-v-cache-explained/" >AMD 3D V-Cache <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> helps the 7950X3D gain an advantage.</p><p> Let’s also look at Hardware Unboxed’s results (linked above) when it tested the i7-14700K against the competition.

This is where the 14700 K’s 20 (8P + 12E) cores shine, allowing it to outperform the 13700 K’s 16 cores and the 7800X3D’s eight cores.</p><p> However, we get the same story when it comes to gaming. AMD’s massive 3D V-Cache allows the 7800X3D to outperform 13700K and 14700K chips in most games.</p><h2 id="5-You-Probably-Don’t-Need-the-14th-Gen’s-Latest-Features"><a href="#5-You-Probably-Don’t-Need-the-14th-Gen’s-Latest-Features" class="headerlink" title="5.

These allow for faster data transmission and make you make the most of your processor.</p><p> However, Wi-Fi 7 and Thunderbolt 5 aren’t widely used yet, and most users don’t overclock their computers. So, unless all your devices use these standards, and you want to squeeze every ounce of performance out of your processor (which runs the risk of voiding your warranty), you probably do not need these.</p><h2 id="6-Intel’s-13th-Gen-Chips-Are-More-Affordable"><a href="#6-Intel’s-13th-Gen-Chips-Are-More-Affordable" class="headerlink" title="6. Intel’s 13th-Gen Chips Are More Affordable"></a>6. Intel’s 13th-Gen Chips Are More Affordable</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Processor</strong></th><th><strong>Launch Price</strong></th><th><strong>Processor</strong></th><th><strong>Launch Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intel Core i9-14900K</td><td>$599</td><td>Intel Core i9-13900K</td><td>$589</td></tr><tr><td>Intel Core i7-14700K</td><td>$419</td><td>Intel Core i7-13700K</td><td>$409</td></tr><tr><td>Intel Core i5-14600K</td><td>$329</td><td>Intel Core i5-13600K</td><td>$319</td></tr></tbody></table><p> 14th-Gen Intel chips have a slight performance advantage over the previous generation, and their launch price is also just $10 more than the 13th-Gen chips. However, since the latter was already a year old when the former launched, you can find them much cheaper than their launch prices.</p><p> For example, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF54SR1?crid=TPJ7LWWLEGQP&keywords=Intel+Core+i9-13900K&qid=1698833400&sprefix=intel+core+i9-1900k,aps,466&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.2b70bf2b-6730-4ccf-ab97-eb60747b8daf&linkCode=ll1&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=ebe8f0f9e5ff8f761e8cb280840044e4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2030903&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-avoid-intel-14th-gen-cpu/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >get the 13900K on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $547, and <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.newegg.com/intel-core-i7-13700k-core-i7-13th-gen/p/N82E16819118414" >the 13700K is on Newegg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $394.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=13600K&crid=3CIM1ATKS2XDM&sprefix=samsung+85-inch+4k+qled+mini+led+t,aps,341&linkCode=ll2&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=3da7c8a35577727dad3e0f97551d2f64&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2030903&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-avoid-intel-14th-gen-cpu/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >The 13600K is also available on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $308.</p><p> While the discount seems small compared to the 13th-Gen’s launch prices, you still save $20 to $50 over the 14th-Gen chips with an almost imperceptible difference in performance. You can then use these savings for things you want, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-newbie-tips-buying-mechanical-keyboard/" >buying your first mechanical keyboard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="You-Can-Skip-the-14th-Gen-Intel-Processors"><a href="#You-Can-Skip-the-14th-Gen-Intel-Processors" class="headerlink" title="You Can Skip the 14th-Gen Intel Processors"></a>You Can Skip the 14th-Gen Intel Processors</h2><p> The 14th-Gen Intel chips aren’t a giant leap for Intel—it’s more like a tiny step that adds a small bump in power and performance. If you currently have a 12th or 13th-gen Intel processor or an equivalent AMD build, the 14th-Gen isn’t a worthwhile upgrade.</p><p> If you’re upgrading from an older PC, consider getting the 13th-Gen instead, as you get better value for money with them. I’ll only recommend Intel’s 14th-Gen processors if you need its Wi-Fi 7, Thunderbolt 5, and AI-powered overclocking features—or if you get a good deal on them.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-fsr-3-launch-challenger-to-nvidias-dynamic-super-sampling/"><u>AMD's FSR 3 Launch: Challenger to NVIDIA's Dynamic Super Sampling?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-elgato-stream-deck-top-picks-and-comparisons/"><u>Best Elgato Stream Deck: Top Picks & Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-get-back-lost-data-from-poco-m6-pro-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>The way to get back lost data from Poco M6 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ever-changing-era-of-ai-video-translation-a-reality-to-be-fulfilled/"><u>2024 Approved The Ever-Changing Era of AI Video Translation A Reality to Be Fulfilled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-effortlessly-post-videos-on-youtube-with-our-expert-guide/"><u>[New] Effortlessly Post Videos on YouTube with Our Expert Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-color-keying-simplified-an-all-inclusive-beginners-manual-on-green-screens/"><u>[Updated] Color Keying Simplified  An All-Inclusive Beginner's Manual on Green Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/apex-of-pc-gaming-raider-ge78-review-highlights/"><u>Apex of PC Gaming: Raider GE78 Review Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/android-retro-replaying-classic-pokemon-adventures/"><u>Android Retro: Replaying Classic Pokemon Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-8-lite-simulations-playing-android-on-desktop/"><u>Best 8 Lite Simulations: Playing Android on Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bargain-hunting-in-steam-finding-high-quality-games-for-zilch/"><u>Bargain Hunting in Steam: Finding High-Quality Games for Zilch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/alternative-methods-for-a-quick-ps5-startup/"><u>Alternative Methods for a Quick PS5 Startup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-stars-of-tomorrow-perfecting-reaction-videos-for-audiences-through-dual-perspectives/"><u>[New] Stars of Tomorrow  Perfecting Reaction Videos for Audiences Through Dual Perspectives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleashing-full-hd-clarity-on-every-tweet-scroll/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleashing Full HD Clarity on Every Tweet Scroll</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/before-you-buy-pause-here-4-ps5-warnings/"><u>Before You Buy, Pause Here: 4 PS5 Warnings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/behold-pimax-crystal-vivid-immersion-with-intermittent-flaws/"><u>Behold Pimax Crystal - Vivid Immersion with Intermittent Flaws</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/adventure-awaits-in-augmented-reality/"><u>Adventure Awaits in Augmented Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-game-hits-without-an-internet-connection-ios/"><u>Best Game Hits Without an Internet Connection (iOS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-mac-devices-changing-gamers-landscape/"><u>Are Mac Devices Changing Gamers’ Landscape?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-and-gaming-the-revolution-of-nvidias-dlss-technology-in-update-35/"><u>AI and Gaming: The Revolution of Nvidia’s DLSS Technology in Update 3.5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-seated-player-partnerships-top-16-on-xbox-series-sx/"><u>Best Seated Player Partnerships - Top 16 on Xbox Series S/X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/battle-of-displays-which-outperforms-oled-amoled-or-lcd/"><u>Battle of Displays: Which Outperforms OLED, AMOLED or LCD?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/key-english-phrases-made-effortless-by-oxford-and-mondly/"><u>Key English Phrases Made Effortless by Oxford & Mondly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/amds-gpu-showdown-exploring-xt-series-specs/"><u>AMD's GPU Showdown: Exploring XT Series Specs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-game-titans-stifling-creativity-industry-report/"><u>Are Game Titans Stifling Creativity?
