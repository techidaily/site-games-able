PC Gamers"></a>Tech Titans Clash: Xbox Series X Vs. PC Gamers</h2><p> Xbox vs. PC is a discussion that sparks every time a new generation Xbox comes to the light. With the Xbox Series X leading this generation of Microsoft’s gaming consoles, it is yet again something to think about.</p><p> This is especially true considering that you may not be able to get your hands on one easily. If you are reading this later, you may not have a problem with that.</p><p> Here, we shall compare the Xbox Series X to a gaming PC based on important factors to help you make the ultimate decision of which one to get.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Things-to-Keep-in-Mind-When-Comparing-Xbox-to-PC"><a href="#Things-to-Keep-in-Mind-When-Comparing-Xbox-to-PC" class="headerlink" title="Things to Keep in Mind When Comparing Xbox to PC"></a>Things to Keep in Mind When Comparing Xbox to PC</h2><p> While this article aims to provide you with essential pointers, you will have to keep a few things in mind:</p><ul><li>The pricing for Xbox Series X console and PC components can vary with time and country.</li><li>The availability of the console and graphics card for a gaming PC is another deciding factor.</li></ul><p> Now, with that in mind, let us walk through some important points comparing the Xbox Series X and a gaming PC.</p><h2 id="Xbox-Series-X-vs-Gaming-PC-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#Xbox-Series-X-vs-Gaming-PC-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Series X vs. Gaming PC: Which Is Better?"></a>Xbox Series X vs. Gaming PC: Which Is Better?</h2><p> Both the Xbox and a gaming PC have a lot to offer, but which one comes out on top when comparing the two? Let’s look at the key factors you should consider when deciding whether to buy an Xbox or a gaming PC.</p><h3 id="The-Xbox-and-PC-Game-Ecosystem"><a href="#The-Xbox-and-PC-Game-Ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="The Xbox and PC Game Ecosystem"></a>The Xbox and PC Game Ecosystem</h3><p> It is not just the hardware that you interact with, you should also consider the availability of games and the pricing of titles.</p><p> While<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-xbox-game-pass-everything-need-know/" >Xbox Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers considerable value for both PC and console, the base subscription for PC includes an extra<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play" >EA Play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subscription. To access EA titles on your Xbox console, you will have to opt for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/feature.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image featuring the Xbox Game Pass logo"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/04/11/pc-game-pass-now-available-40-countries/" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Xbox Game Pass offers plenty of games and discounts on both platforms. So, if you rely on Xbox Game Pass alone, both offers are of a similar value, with a slight edge to PC subscribers.</p><p> However, you are restricted to the Microsoft store or the shelves of your local game shop when purchasing games for the Xbox Series X.</p><p> With a gaming PC, you can access a variety of other game stores, like Steam and Epic Games, that feature massive collections of games with regular deals and even free games. Furthermore, there are endless possibilities for new subscriptions and services in the near future, considering you do not rely on a single company, unlike the Xbox Series X.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Xbox-and-PC-Hardware-Capabilities"><a href="#Xbox-and-PC-Hardware-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Xbox and PC Hardware Capabilities"></a>Xbox and PC Hardware Capabilities</h3><p> The Xbox Series X is a capable console that features an 8-core Zen 2-based AMD processor with AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture-powered GPU, providing 52 compute units.</p><p> Xbox Series X specs are almost equivalent to a Ryzen 7 3700X desktop processor paired with Radeon RX 6800 or Nvidia RTX 3070. So, the Xbox Series X graphics prowess is impressive enough for 4K gaming and 120 FPS experience on paper.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hardware-cpu-gpu.jpg"                      alt="hardware-cpu-gpu"                ></p><p> Of course, the performance depends on the type of game you play. So, you should not expect a fully-fledged 4K gaming experience with 120 frames for all games.</p><p> A gaming PC with that specification may not be enough for fully-fledged 4K gaming either, but you get the option to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-deep-learning-super-sampling-can-give-budget-pcs-top-end-graphics/" >utilize DLSS to give budget PCs top-end graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-how-to-use/" >use AMD’s Fidelity FX Super Resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to improve the performance. But, you may be able to experience better on the console for its optimization.</p><p> However, if you consider a high-end gaming PC, you can easily get to experience more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Xbox-and-PC-Price"><a href="#Xbox-and-PC-Price" class="headerlink" title="Xbox and PC Price"></a>Xbox and PC Price</h3><p> Building a high-end gaming PC is certainly an expensive endeavor. If you want every component of your system to be top-notch, the sky’s the limit. You can even end up purchasing a ~$700 PC cabinet just for its aesthetics.</p><p> It is important when building a PC, however, to make sure you’re not overpaying for the components.</p><p> It takes a significant amount of research to set up a good gaming rig. You can choose to purchase a pre-built gaming system from<a class="link"   href="https://nzxt.com/" >NZXT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and others for convenience, but the Xbox Series X is significantly cheaper for its gaming capabilities and hassle-free one-unit purchase.</p><h3 id="Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Upgrade-Options"><a href="#Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Upgrade-Options" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Upgrade Options"></a>Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Upgrade Options</h3><p> It is important to understand whether you want to upgrade your system after a few years or just purchase a new one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hardware-upgrade.jpg"                      alt="hardware-upgrade"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you consider getting a PC, you can easily upgrade it. In fact, you can select to upgrade any component separately, which is a massive advantage for longevity. For instance, if your gaming PC performance is not satisfactory after a few years, you can simply choose to upgrade the graphics card while keeping the rest intact.</p><p> However, you get limited upgrade choices with Xbox Series X. You can only upgrade the storage space and not the chip or graphics card. So, in the case of a console, you will need to purchase a new Xbox (next-gen) to upgrade. But, a PC upgrade may save you more money over the years.</p><p> Not to forget, if you already have a mid-range PC that runs decently well, you can get a few new upgrades (like a new graphics card) to step up your gaming experience within a budget. Ultimately, it depends on your requirements, but for the most part, you should be able to save a few bucks and breathe life into your old PC.</p><h3 id="Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Portability"><a href="#Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Portability" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Portability"></a>Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Portability</h3><p> When it comes to portability, a gaming PC may not be as convenient as the Xbox Series X.</p><p> Technically, you can build a mini-ITX gaming system that is similarly portable. But, it is a challenging task to do it the right way.</p><p> When it comes to a gaming desktop, you will have to take care of the cooling and the form factor for the components you use. It could end up being a disaster if you do not know what you are doing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/liquid-cooled-gaming-pc-build.jpg"                      alt="liquid cooled gaming PC build with RGB lighting"                ></p><p> Of course, if you want the ultimate portability, a high-end laptop can prove to be better than the Xbox Series X, but you may lose out on the performance with the money you spend. Furthermore, a laptop has limited options for upgrade.</p><p> Overall, when considering a PC, you get choices for portability, but a console is already a portable machine from the get-go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049383/7443" target="_top" id="2049383">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049383" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049383/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Warranty-and-After-Sales"><a href="#Xbox-Series-X-and-Gaming-PC-Warranty-and-After-Sales" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Warranty and After-Sales"></a>Xbox Series X and Gaming PC Warranty and After-Sales</h3><p> With Xbox Series X, you get a limited warranty of one year for the machine. You can consider extending the warranty for up to three years, but it may not be available at all retailers.</p><p> In the case of a PC, you get a warranty issued for every component you purchase. Most of them offer a three-year warranty period and some even offer five to 10 years of warranty. This is a massive difference in terms of assurance and longevity.</p><p> Of course, the Xbox Series X may not fail for years (in most cases), but you have the assurance of getting parts replaced for years to come in the case of PC components.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-Should-You-Go-For-An-Xbox-Series-X-or-a-Gaming-PC"><a href="#Which-Should-You-Go-For-An-Xbox-Series-X-or-a-Gaming-PC" class="headerlink" title="Which Should You Go For: An Xbox Series X or a Gaming PC?"></a>Which Should You Go For: An Xbox Series X or a Gaming PC?</h2><p> If you want to focus on playing games with 4K support and want the convenience of a console, the Xbox Series X should be a great choice.</p><p> But if you want the ability to upgrade, access to more games, and a multi-purpose system, a PC should be your pick.</p><p> Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, you will have to weigh up your priorities and pick what is more important for you.</p><h2 id="Enjoy-Upgrading-Your-Gaming-Experience"><a href="#Enjoy-Upgrading-Your-Gaming-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Upgrading Your Gaming Experience"></a>Enjoy Upgrading Your Gaming Experience</h2><p> There are so many gaming platforms out there, and they all have a particular niche that they fill.</p><p> But whether you opt for the convenience of the Xbox Series X or the power and customization opportunities that a gaming PC can give you, rest assured that you will have an incredible time gaming on either of these amazing platforms.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-download-direct-top-5-best-cost-free-apps-for-vids-on-pinterest-for-2024/"><u>[New] Download Direct Top 5 Best, Cost-Free Apps for Vids on Pinterest for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-captivate-audiences-quickly-shortcuts-for-youtube-trailers-with-filmora/"><u>[Updated] Captivate Audiences Quickly Shortcuts for YouTube Trailers with Filmora</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tap-into-endless-creativity-our-compilation-of-over-50-free-advertising-masterpieces/"><u>[Updated] Tap Into Endless Creativity – Our Compilation of over 50 FREE Advertising Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/boost-your-ai-skills-discover-the-7-key-tips-for-flawlessly-crafted-prompts/"><u>Boost Your AI Skills: Discover the 7 Key Tips for Flawlessly Crafted Prompts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/delving-into-discords-game-realm-from-chess-to-poker/"><u>Delving Into Discord's Game Realm: From Chess to Poker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/fine-tune-pc-experience-managing-game-bar-backgrounds/"><u>Fine-Tune PC Experience: Managing Game Bar Backgrounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-tips-lipo-power-sources-for-aerial-vehicles/"><u>In 2024, Top Tips LiPo Power Sources for Aerial Vehicles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/opera-gx-and-microsofts-edge-face-off-best-browser-decision-guide/"><u>Opera GX & Microsoft's Edge Face-Off: Best Browser Decision Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/seamlessly-convert-mp4-files-to-webm-for-free-using-movavis-online-service/"><u>Seamlessly Convert MP4 Files to WebM for Free Using Movavi's Online Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/tailored-airflow-algorithms-elevate-gaming-experience/"><u>Tailored Airflow Algorithms Elevate Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-fix-for-msvbvm50dll-not-found-errors-on-your-pc/"><u>The Ultimate Fix for msvbvm50.dll Not Found Errors on Your PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/top-8-methods-for-cracking-drm-on-your-dvds-discover-free-solutions/"><u>Top 8 Methods for Cracking DRM on Your DVDs: Discover Free Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-facebook/"><u>When Is the Best Time to Post on Facebook?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives. Instead of adding external storage, you can add another SSD to your PS5 using the built-in and empty SSD slot, which should help alleviate any performance issues. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-drive/"><strong>The best PS5 external hard drives for storing all your games</strong></a></p><p>Below I’ll walk you through what you’ll need and the steps you’ll take to install an SSD in your PlayStation, expanding your gaming storage. </p><h2 id="How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5"><a href="#How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5" class="headerlink" title="How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5"></a>How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5</h2><p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> To add additional storage to your PlayStation 5 using the built-in SSD slot, you’ll need some supplies. </p><p>You’ll, of course, need an SSD.

While there are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-play-minecraft-with-friends/" >other ways to play Minecraft with friends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , crossplay between Java and Bedrock isn’t something that comes up often.</p><p> This is because the Minecraft Java and Bedrock editions aren’t written in the same programming language. Minecraft Bedrock Edition is written in C++ while the Java Edition is written in Java, as its name suggests.</p><p> C++ is a more efficient language, which is why Bedrock is available on various platforms, like Android, iOS, and consoles. Java is less efficient in comparison, hence the need for a PC to run it smoothly.</p><p> However, the GeyserMC mod takes the C++ information and translates it to Java, emulating a Java Minecraft client. This allows Bedrock Edition players to join Java Edition servers and play as if they were on the same version of the game.</p><h2 id="How-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Players-Can-Join-Java-Edition-Servers"><a href="#How-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-Players-Can-Join-Java-Edition-Servers" class="headerlink" title="How Minecraft Bedrock Edition Players Can Join Java Edition Servers"></a>How Minecraft Bedrock Edition Players Can Join Java Edition Servers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/two-minecraft-versions-open-at-the-same-time.JPG"                      alt="Two Minecraft versions open at the same time"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> This process involves both versions of Minecraft running at the same time on one computer, connected to the same Java server.

Mods aren’t something that can be easily translated to different versions of Minecraft. You’ll be limited by simpler mods, like ones that a vanilla Java Edition player can still join.</p><p> There are also more fundamental limitations that have no workarounds, like crafting in the 2x2 menu in creative mode, distinguishing between left and right clicks in the inventory, and a bunch more. You can check out the list of the latest limitations on the<a class="link"   href="https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/current-limitations/" >official GeyserMC wiki <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find out all the limitations they know about.</p><p> While it has limitations, this can rarely get in the way of having fun. Now you don’t have to be worried that you and your friend have different versions of Minecraft. We hope this guide has helped you enjoy Minecraft with your friends no matter what they’re playing on.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/495plus-high-framerate-display-by-innocn/"><u>$495+ High Framerate Display by InnoCN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/harness-free-methods-to-download-vimeo-videos-with-ease/"><u>Harness Free Methods to Download Vimeo Videos with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/high-end-fb-visual-creator-free/"><u>High-End FB Visual Creator (FREE)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-does-hrtf-affect-your-valorant-play/"><u>How Does HRTF Affect Your Valorant Play?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-tecno-pova-5-by-phone-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Tecno Pova 5 by Phone Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On OnePlus Nord N30 SE? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-optimizing-dragons-dogma-2-performance-strategies-to-eliminate-lag-and-hiccups/"><u>Master the Art of Optimizing Dragon's Dogma 2 Performance: Strategies to Eliminate Lag and Hiccups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/strategic-gaming-for-sustained-performance/"><u>Strategic Gaming for Sustained Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/stylus-symphony-tablet-takes-over-mice/"><u>Stylus Symphony: Tablet Takes Over Mice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unleash-pro-quality-videos-top-free-online-video-enhancement-tools/"><u>Updated In 2024, Unleash Pro-Quality Videos Top Free Online Video Enhancement Tools</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Nvidia’s GeForce Experience can automatically capture highlights, but there are two major downsides to it: only a few popular games support it and you need an Nvidia GPU.</p><p> While you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-record-video-while-gaming-on/" >record gameplay on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , most alternative highlighting apps require you to press a hotkey to record the past few seconds or minutes. This can easily be forgotten when you’re focused on the game.</p><p> Some highlight apps tag highlights, but they require you to record the entire session. This leaves you with a huge file and needing to sort through the footage to find which clip is from which match.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098700/14409" target="_top" id="2098700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098700/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Outplayed-for-Game-Highlights-Recording"><a href="#How-to-Use-Outplayed-for-Game-Highlights-Recording" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Outplayed for Game Highlights Recording"></a>How to Use Outplayed for Game Highlights Recording</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/outplayed-logo-on-white-background.jpg"                      alt="Outplayed logo on white background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://go.overwolf.com/outplayed/" >Overwolf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Of the many highlight apps I’ve tried, Outplayed does it better than any other.

If you click on your game on<strong>My Games</strong> list, it should have an<strong>Auto captured events</strong> section if Outplayed supports it for the game.</p><p> For example, Apex Legends has eight events that can trigger auto-capturing.</p><p> While you’re in the settings, you might want to turn off<strong>Open Outplayed when game ends</strong> in case that feature annoys you. However, I find it convenient so I don’t forget to save good clips.</p><h3 id="3-Customize-Your-Highlight-Events"><a href="#3-Customize-Your-Highlight-Events" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Nintendo-Setup-Guide-Maximizing-Your-Experience"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Nintendo-Setup-Guide-Maximizing-Your-Experience" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Nintendo Setup Guide: Maximizing Your Experience"></a>The Ultimate Nintendo Setup Guide: Maximizing Your Experience</h2><p> The Nintendo Switch is already a very user-friendly and convenient console, but there are several settings you might be sleeping on that could make your experience with it even better. None of these settings are activated by default, so if you don’t know about them, you are likely not using your Switch to its full potential.</p><p> If you want to learn how to extend your Switch’s battery life, get faster download speeds, and get better graphics while playing docked, you can find all of that and more below.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves"><a href="#1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Cloud Data Saves"></a>1. Enable Cloud Data Saves</h2><p> Have you ever spent hours on a game and lost all of your progress? This issue is more common than you would think. Whether your Switch gets stolen, you break your console accidentally, or maybe you lend your sibling your Switch, and they accidentally save over your save file. These things are unfortunate, but they can happen, and that can result in hours of progress down the drain.</p><p> If you’ve ever experienced this, you will understand the seven stages of grief that follow, usually culminating in you deciding to ditch the game for good rather than spend countless hours building back up to the point you were at before. All of this can be avoided, however, if you activate Cloud saves on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/save-data-cloud-settings-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Save Data Cloud Settings on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To do so, head to the settings and make your way to<strong>Data Management</strong> . From there, click<strong>Save Data Cloud</strong> and choose your<strong>user profile</strong> . Scroll down to<strong>Settings</strong> at the bottom and turn on<strong>Automatically Back Up Save Data</strong> . Once you have activated this setting, you will be able to retrieve any data you lose. This feature is only available if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life"><a href="#2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life"></a>2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life</h2><p> Putting your Nintendo Switch in Flight Mode limits your ability to connect to the internet. But if the game you’re currently playing doesn’t use internet, you can save a decent amount of battery life by putting your Switch in Flight Mode even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</p><p> Being connected to the internet and having your console constantly send and receive that signal uses energy. Putting your console in Flight Mode saves valuable resources that, if you’re not using them anyway, are better used elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/flight-mode-menu-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Flight Mode Menu on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To put your phone on Flight Mode. Simply open your settings and scroll down to<strong>Flight Mode</strong> . It’s the second option on the menu and will only take a moment to activate, but could save you precious moments in your game.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch"></a>3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch</h2><p> The Switch doesn’t have a lot of storage space. A Switch Lite, for example, only has 32GB of space available, and a portion of that is reserved for the system. 32GB may sound like a lot, but if you’re looking at downloading big games, even the Switch OLED’s improved 64 GB will quickly disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/quick-archive-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Quick Archive on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Your options here are to buy a large SD card to give your Switch more storage space or juggle your games. If your Switch is full, but you want to download a new game, don’t worry. You don’t have to delete all of your games to make space, you can quickly archive them instead.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-how-to-archive-software/" >Archiving software on your Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> still frees up storage space, but leaves an icon of the game on your home screen, so you can quickly and easily redownload it when you’re ready.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio"><a href="#4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4.

So Switch owners are now able to enjoy all the wonderful sounds of the Switch without the pesky wires.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/activate-bluetooth-audio-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Activate Bluetooth Audio on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Not everyone keeps up to date with the ins and outs of every Nintendo Switch update that comes out. So, if you, like many others, were still unaware of the fact that you could connect Bluetooth headphones to your Switch, this may come as a welcome surprise to you.

Tweak Your TV Resolution Settings to Get Better Graphics</h2><p> One of the most underrated Nintendo Switch settings can actually improve the graphics of your system when you’re playing in docked mode. But like many other settings on this list, it is buried in menus and not easy to find unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Thankfully, you have us to show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tv-resolution-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="TV Resolution on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> If your TV is capable of displaying a 1080p image, so is your Nintendo Switch. In handheld mode, the Switch is only capable of 720p, but this can be improved in docked mode.

This is a phenomenon caused by a wearing down of the mechanisms inside the joystick that leads to false input in your controller and makes your character or camera start moving on its own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-calibrate-controller-on-nintendo-switch-calibrate-control-sticks.jpg"                      alt="How to calibrate controller on Nintendo Switch Calibrate Control Sticks"                ></p><p> This issue can cause some serious headaches in-game, but there is a way to fix it (if the case is mild enough.) That is by recalibrating your Joy-Cons or any other controller you may be having issues with. Simply head to your settings, select<strong>Controllers and Sensors</strong> , and press<strong>Calibrate Control Sticks</strong> . The Switch will guide you through the rest of the process, and you should finally experience some relief from drift for a little while, at least.</p><h2 id="7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds"><a href="#7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds" class="headerlink" title="7.

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives. Instead of adding external storage, you can add another SSD to your PS5 using the built-in and empty SSD slot, which should help alleviate any performance issues. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-drive/"><strong>The best PS5 external hard drives for storing all your games</strong></a></p><p>Below I’ll walk you through what you’ll need and the steps you’ll take to install an SSD in your PlayStation, expanding your gaming storage. </p><h2 id="How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5"><a href="#How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5" class="headerlink" title="How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5"></a>How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5</h2><p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> To add additional storage to your PlayStation 5 using the built-in SSD slot, you’ll need some supplies. </p><p>You’ll, of course, need an SSD. There’s a certain type of SSD that Sony requires. More specifically, you’ll need a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD with a heatsink. That’s a lot of jargon, I know. But the good news is, pretty much every company that makes SSDs has an SSD that’ll work with and is advertised for the PS5. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-games/"><strong>The best PS5 games</strong></a></p><p>I used a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P2T0CW/dp/B09JHKSNNG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C35c5e9a9-34c0-4827-9f6b-00a31f898678%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung 980 Pro with Heatsink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that meets all of Sony’s requirements and comes in various storage capacities. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy an SSD that has a heatsink already attached, you can buy a third-party option.

Lay the console on a table, with the front of the console (it’s the side with the PS logo) facing down, and the rear of the console towards you. I put mine on top of a desk mat to prevent scratches on the case. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-headset/"><strong>The best PS5 headsets you can buy</strong></a></p><p>To gain access to the SSD slot, you’ll need to remove the back cover.

Modern Marvel: Key Distinctions"></a>Old PS5 Vs. Modern Marvel: Key Distinctions</h2><p> With Sony releasing a slimmer version of the PlayStation 5, many people are quite excited. However, others are understandably wondering what this newer and slimmer version of Sony’s current-gen console brings to the table when compared to the older and fatter PS5. Here’s everything you need to know about their differences.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Sony-Is-Launching-a-New-Slimmer-PS5"><a href="#Sony-Is-Launching-a-New-Slimmer-PS5" class="headerlink" title="Sony Is Launching a New (Slimmer) PS5"></a>Sony Is Launching a New (Slimmer) PS5</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/new-slim-version-of-the-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the new slimmer PS5 version"                ></p><p> Image credit:<a class="link"   href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/" >Sony <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> In October 2023,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/new-ps5-slim-what-you-need-to-know/" >Sony announced that it was re-releasing the PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a new look. The redesigned version of the console features a smaller design, earning it the unofficial title of the “PS5 Slim,” and has the option to attach a disk drive to it.</p><p> The new PS5 will be available sometime in November (in time for the holiday season) in select retail stores and on<a class="link"   href="https://direct.playstation.com/" >direct.playstation.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Rollout will start in the U.S., with a global launch expected in the months to follow. The disc version of the “PS5 Slim” will retail at $499.99, while the digital version will set you back $449.99.</p><h2 id="Old-PS5-Models-vs-New-PS5-Models-The-Differences"><a href="#Old-PS5-Models-vs-New-PS5-Models-The-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Old PS5 Models vs. New PS5 Models: The Differences"></a>Old PS5 Models vs. New PS5 Models: The Differences</h2><p> With this new PS5 version, Sony has worked on some improvements that go beyond aesthetics. If you already own a PS5, you might be wondering if the differences are worth upgrading, or, if you haven’t got one yet, purchase it now. Let’s take a look at them in a little more detail.</p><h2 id="Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Size-and-Weight"><a href="#Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Size-and-Weight" class="headerlink" title="Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Size and Weight"></a>Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Size and Weight</h2><p> A major change to the PS5’s design is the size. The launch PS5’s dimensions were 390mm x 260mm x 104mm (height, width, depth) for the disc edition, while the digital edition had dimensions of 390mm x 260mm x 92mm. The smaller PS5s have dimensions of 358mm x 216mm x 96mm and 358mm x 216mm x 80mm for the disc and digital editions, respectively.</p><p> If you’re having trouble imagining what that looks like, we entered the sizes of all the PS5 models, old and new, into<a class="link"   href="https://comparesizes.com/comparison/Old-PS5-Disc-Edition-vs-Old-PS5-Digital-Edition-vs-New-PS5-Disc-Edition/1697380758700" >CompareSizes.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Looking at the results, while smaller than the original, the newer PS5 models will still take up some space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-size-differences-for-all-ps5-versions-on-comparesizes-website.jpg"                      alt="the size differences for all PS5 versions on the CompareSizes website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Sony has also reduced the weight of the disc edition from 9.9 pounds to 7.05 pounds. The weight of the digital edition has gone down to 5.73 pounds from 8.6 pounds (of course, it will weigh a little more if you attach the disk drive).</p><h2 id="Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Attachable-Disk-Drive"><a href="#Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Attachable-Disk-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Attachable Disk Drive"></a>Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Attachable Disk Drive</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/detachable-disk-drive-for-the-new-smaller-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the attachable disk drive for the new smaller PS5"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037355/7443" target="_top" id="2037355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037355/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image credit:<a class="link"   href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/10/new-look-for-ps5-console-this-holiday-season/" >Sony <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> One of the other big changes is that the digital version of the new PS5 has an attachable Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive. The attachment will cost you $79.99, and it’s incompatible with the old digital version. However, it’s nice to know that the option exists should you decide to use disks later on​​​​.</p><h2 id="Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Specs"><a href="#Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Specs" class="headerlink" title="Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Specs"></a>Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Specs</h2><p> Many of the core specs between the old and new PS5 models have remained largely the same. For example, both consoles have an x86-64-AMD Ryzen Zen 2 CPU with a clock speed of 3.5 GHz (variable frequency). They also use an AMD Radeon RDNA 2 GPU, but while the old PS5’s GPU supports hardware-level Ray Tracing, the new model’s GPU supports Ray Tracing Acceleration to make calculations faster.</p><p> There’s also a very small increase in teraflops, which is a measurement of a device’s raw computing power. The old model has 10.28 teraflops, while the new one has 10.3 (a 0.02 difference).</p><p> While the RAM for both versions remains the same (16GB of GDDR6 RAM), the slimmer model has more internal storage space. The total size of the old PS5’s SSD is 825 GB, which goes down to 667.2 GB once you factor in the OS. The “PS5 Slim,” on the other hand, has 1TB of internal space, which comes down to 842.2 GB because of the OS.</p><p> So that means you’ll have over 200GB of extra internal storage space on the new PS5. You can always upgrade it by<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-m2-ssd-ps5-guide/" >adding an M.2 SSD to the PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with more storage space if that’s still not enough.</p><h2 id="Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Price"><a href="#Old-PS5-vs-New-PS5-Price" class="headerlink" title="Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Price"></a>Old PS5 vs. New PS5: Price</h2><p> The price of the old disc version of the PS5 is $499.99, and the new version will cost the same. The price for the old digital edition is $399.99, while the new one costs $449.99, marking a price increase.

Turn Off Controller Vibration for Your Xbox Wireless Controller</h2><p> One of the main drainers on your Xbox Wireless Controller’s battery life is its rumble and vibration features. While vibration may enhance your experience in-game, it takes up a lot of energy. Luckily, through your Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S console, you can disable vibrations and save energy.</p><p> By utilizing the<strong>Xbox Accessories</strong> app on your Xbox console, it’s easy to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-universally-turn-off-controller-vibration-on-xbox-series-x-s/" >turn off vibrations for your Xbox Wireless Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but the steps can be summarized by the following:</p><ul><li>Enter the<strong>My games &amp; apps</strong> section of your Xbox.</li><li>Highlight<strong>Apps</strong> , and select<strong>Xbox Accessories</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3147.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Apps selection screen on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><ul><li>Find your<strong>Xbox Wireless Controller</strong> , and select<strong>Configure</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3150.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Xbox Accessories application with the option to Configure an Xbox controller highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Select<strong>Edit</strong> .</li><li>Ensure<strong>Turn on vibration</strong> is deselected.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3153.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the customization options for an Xbox Wireless Controller on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> And with<strong>Turn on vibration</strong> no longer checked off as an in-use option for your Xbox controller, you should never experience controller vibration from that specific controller unless you re-enable the setting.</p><p> However, if you want to disable vibration to preserve energy for specific games, you are best utilizing the in-game settings for the game in question to see if you can turn off vibration. This way, you can cater your gaming experience in individual Xbox titles to your preference while conserving your controller’s battery.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Take-Advantage-of-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Accessories"><a href="#2-Take-Advantage-of-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you power down your Xbox but not your controller, the controller will remain active.</p><p> To prevent your Xbox controller from wasting energy, when you turn off your Xbox console, you should also ensure you completely turn off your Xbox Wireless Controller. You can do this in the same way as you would your console: hold the<strong>Xbox button</strong> down for a few seconds, and select<strong>Turn off controller</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3156.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of option to Turn Off Controller on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And with that, you can guarantee that your controller won’t be wasting any of your leftover battery life.

But sometimes it can be a bit too much, and you might want more privacy regarding your Steam activity.</p><p> In this article, we’ll take a look at how you can stop your friends from checking your gameplay activity, how you can hide games from your library, or how to make your profile private. And if you don’t want your friends to see that you’ve been up all night playing, there’s an easy trick to replace your recent activity.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Hide-Played-Steam-Games"><a href="#1-Hide-Played-Steam-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Hide Played Steam Games"></a>1. Hide Played Steam Games</h2><p> When someone visits your profile, they can see which games you’ve played and for how many hours. Now, if you don’t want your gamer friends to discover your guilty pleasures, you can hide your played games from your profile.</p><ol><li>Launch Steam.</li><li>Hover the cursor over your username and select<strong>View my profile</strong> .</li><li>Click the<strong>Edit Profile</strong> button.</li><li>Select<strong>Privacy settings</strong> .</li><li>Next to<strong>Game details</strong> , click<strong>Public</strong> and set it to<strong>Friends Only</strong> or<strong>Private</strong> if you don’t want anyone to see your list of played games.

Hide Steam Games From Your Library"></a>2. Hide Steam Games From Your Library</h2><p> If you’re sharing the computer with anyone else, it might make sense to hide certain games from your Steam library. Maybe they’re younger than you and the in-game content is not appropriate for their age.</p><p> Or you’re just embarrassed about playing a game, and you don’t want family or friends to discover it. To hide any game, launch the Steam app and head to your library. There, select the game you want to hide, click the<strong>Settings</strong> icon and select<strong>Manage &gt; Hide this game</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hide-steam-game-1.jpg"                      alt="Hide Steam game from library"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you want to play the game that you’ve hidden, go to<strong>View &gt; Hidden games</strong> . To bring back the game to your library, access its settings and click<strong>Manage &gt; Remove from hidden</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unhide-game-steam-1.jpg"                      alt="Unhide Steam game"                ></p><p> Hiding a game is an easy trick, but it might not be enough to prevent other people from finding it. In this case, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-uninstall-steam-games-reinstall/" >uninstall a Steam game and reinstall it later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Hide-Steam-Gameplay-Activity"><a href="#3-Hide-Steam-Gameplay-Activity" class="headerlink" title="3. Hide Steam Gameplay Activity"></a>3. Hide Steam Gameplay Activity</h2><p> Every time you start playing one of your games, Steam will send a notification to all of your Steam friends, if they are online. When you want to enjoy a gaming session with your friends, it can be really useful. But if you’re feeling like playing solo, you should turn off Steam notifications.</p><p> Once you launch the Steam client, open the<strong>Friends</strong> menu, Then, select<strong>Offline</strong> or<strong>Invisible</strong> .</p><p> After you select one of the options, you can play any game within your library without your friends knowing. However, they will be able to see any game achievements or activity if they visit your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-invisible-1.jpg"                      alt="Set status to Invisible on Steam"                ></p><p> The<strong>Offline</strong> option will log you out of the Steam chat, so you’ll not receive any messages from your friends. On the other hand, if you still want to communicate with your friends, it’s better to select<strong>Invisible</strong> . Also, you will not receive any invitations on Steam while you’ve set your status as<strong>Offline</strong> or<strong>Invisible</strong> .</p><p> Besides hiding your Steam gameplay activity, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-customize-in-game-activity-status-steam/" >customize the in-game activity status on Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to confuse your friends.</p><h2 id="4-Hide-Steam-Gameplay-Activity-for-Specific-Friends"><a href="#4-Hide-Steam-Gameplay-Activity-for-Specific-Friends" class="headerlink" title="4. Hide Steam Gameplay Activity for Specific Friends"></a>4. Hide Steam Gameplay Activity for Specific Friends</h2><p> You can hide your Steam gameplay activity for individual friends if hiding it for all of your friends feels like overdoing it.</p><p> Launch the Steam app and click<strong>Friends &amp; Chat</strong> from the bottom-right corner. Click your friend’s name and select<strong>Manage &gt; Block All Communication</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-friends-1.jpg"                      alt="Block friends on Steam"                ></p><p> Once you block all communication, your friends will see you as offline. Also, if they visit your profile, Steam will show your profile as a private one.</p><p> So, if you don’t want to raise suspicions, you should unblock them after a while. Go through the above steps again and select<strong>Unblock All Communication</strong> .</p><h2 id="5-Replace-Recent-Activity"><a href="#5-Replace-Recent-Activity" class="headerlink" title="5. Replace Recent Activity"></a>5. Replace Recent Activity</h2><p> If you didn’t remember to set your status as<strong>Invisible</strong> or<strong>Offline</strong> before going on a gaming marathon, and you don’t want your friends to see your Recent Activity, there’s a quick trick you can try.</p><p> Launch any game from your Steam library and close it after a couple of minutes. Then, do the same thing with two or three other different games. These short sessions should replace your latest activity on your Steam profile.</p><p> Alternatively, you can use Steam’s free watchable episodes to replace your recent activity. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Head to<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Search for one of Steam’s free watchables, such as<strong>The Making of Horizon Zero Dawn</strong> .</li><li>Play one of the episodes.</li><li>Once Steam opens a new window, close it as quickly as possible. This way, Steam doesn’t have a chance to load the content.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-free-watchable-1.jpg"                      alt="Watch Steam&#39;s free watchables"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Go through the above steps two or three more times, but play different episodes.

This will block any form of communication with your friends and will influence multiple categories such as Game details, Friends List, and Inventory.</p><p>Follow these steps to set your profile to Private:</p><ol><li>Hover the mouse over your username and select<strong>View my profile</strong> .</li><li>Click the<strong>Edit profile</strong> button.</li><li>From the left pane, open<strong>Privacy Settings</strong> .</li><li>Set<strong>My profile</strong> to<strong>Private</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/steam-private-profile-1.jpg"                      alt="Set Steam profile to Private"                ></p><h2 id="Keep-Steam-Private"><a href="#Keep-Steam-Private" class="headerlink" title="Keep Steam Private"></a>Keep Steam Private</h2><p> Playing games should always be about having fun and a little privacy might help. With the above tips, you can keep prying eyes away so no one can spoil your gaming sessions. If you want to keep everything to yourself, you should set your profile as<strong>Private</strong> . But if you still want to share game inventory with your friends, you can set your status as<strong>Offline</strong> or<strong>Invisible</strong> before playing.</p><p> If you notice you can’t unlock any achievements on your Steam account, it has nothing to do with your efforts to hide your Steam activity. Instead, try to disable Steam offline mode or take a quick look at the achievement guide. Also, make sure it’s a Steam game.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-triumph-in-the-digital-arena-discovering-youtubes-top-five-tactics/"><u>[New] Triumph in the Digital Arena - Discovering YouTube’s Top Five Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-professional-captions-with-top-online-aids-and-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Professional Captions with Top Online Aids and Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-harness-the-power-of-color-grading-a-guide-to-luts-in-photoshop-cs6/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Harness the Power of Color Grading A Guide to LUTs in Photoshop CS6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-step-by-step-guide-to-find-youtube-hidden-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-By-Step Guide to Find YouTube Hidden Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-iphone-voice-memo-recording-guide/"><u>2024 Approved IPhone Voice Memo Recording Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/digital-game-purchases-9-advantages-and-disadvantages/"><u>Digital Game Purchases: 9 Advantages & Disadvantages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-itel-pattern-lock-if-forgotten-6-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Itel Pattern Lock if Forgotten? 6 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/launch-your-next-switch-game-on-a-mac/"><u>Launch Your Next Switch Game on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/mastering-chatgpt-your-guide-to-tactile-roleplay-games/"><u>Mastering ChatGPT: Your Guide to Tactile Roleplay Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/next-level-performance-pdw4-for-gamers-and-creators/"><u>Next Level Performance: PDW4 for Gamers & Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/optimizing-macos-gaming-with-apples-latest-game-mode-feature-in-sonoma/"><u>Optimizing MacOS Gaming with Apple's Latest Game Mode Feature in Sonoma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/remedying-erratic-behavior-of-xbox-controller-pad/"><u>Remedying Erratic Behavior of Xbox Controller Pad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-roblox-memory-crunch-on-ios-devices/"><u>Resolving Roblox Memory Crunch on iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/vintage-games-and-images-connect-with-win-11/"><u>Vintage Games & Images - Connect With Win 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/why-am-i-exposed-to-these-certain-fb-campaigns/"><u>Why Am I Exposed to These Certain Fb Campaigns?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Or is it a cloud gaming device like the Logitech G Cloud?</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-PlayStation-Portal"><a href="#What-Is-the-PlayStation-Portal" class="headerlink" title="What Is the PlayStation Portal?"></a>What Is the PlayStation Portal?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sony-playstation-portal-product-image.jpg"                      alt="Sony PlayStation Portal product image"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/23/playstations-first-remote-play-dedicated-device-playstation-portal-remote-player-to-launch-later-this-year-at-199-99/" >Sony <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The PlayStation Portal features an eight-inch touchscreen with a 1080p resolution and 60Hz refresh rate. It also features DualSense-like controls on both sides, so it would feel familiar if you’re already a PS5 user.</p><p> It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, Wi-Fi 5 support, and PS Link compatibility. You can charge its 4,370 mAh battery via the USB-C port, which should be enough for about seven to nine hours of gaming.</p><p> But the PlayStation is neither a Steam Deck nor a Logitech G Cloud competitor. Instead, it’s a remote-play device that connects to your PlayStation 5 via Wi-Fi and will only stream games installed locally on your console. This is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-review-ultimate-portable-gaming-console/" >similar to Steam Link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lets you play PC games on your Android or iPhone via streaming.</p><p> So, instead of relying on a server farm to stream your game from the cloud, the PlayStation Portal will depend on your home network and PlayStation 5. You need at least a 5Mbps connection to use the PlayStation Portal, but Sony recommends 15Mbps for reliability.</p><p>Furthermore, you need a PlayStation Network account to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/close-up-of-sony-project-q.jpg"                      alt="Close up of Sony Project Q"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925468/19272" target="_top" id="1925468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925468/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/" >PlayStation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Can-You-Do-With-the-PS-Portal"><a href="#What-Can-You-Do-With-the-PS-Portal" class="headerlink" title="What Can You Do With the PS Portal?"></a>What Can You Do With the PS Portal?</h2><p> Since the PlayStation Portal is essentially a DualSense controller with a screen that streams games from your PlayStation 5. It also has features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers—provided the game you’re streaming is compatible with those features.</p><p> The PlayStation Portal would work best if you use it on the same network that your console is connected to, but as long as you have decent internet speed for both devices (the PlayStation 5 console and the PlayStation Portal handheld), you can play any PlayStation 5 title while away from home. However, games that require other accessories, like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-vr2-review/" >the PlayStation VR2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , won’t work with the Portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/playstation-portal-with-pulse-explore-and-pulse-elite-wireless-audio.jpg"                      alt="PlayStation Portal with Pulse Explore and Pulse Elite wireless audio"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/23/hands-on-report-playstation-portal-remote-player-pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-and-pulse-elite-wireless-headset/" >Sony <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> One downside with the Portal, though, is it doesn’t have Bluetooth connectivity. That means your AirPods and other Bluetooth accessories won’t work with the device. If you want personal audio, use one of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-pc-gaming-headset/" >the best wired gaming headsets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a PlayStation Link-compatible audio device, like the Pulse Elite, Explore, or 3D.</p><p> It also doesn’t have streaming compatibility from outside servers, so even if you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-playstation-plus/" >have a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can’t stream titles directly to the PlayStation Portal. Instead, you must install any title you’re interested in on your PlayStation 5 and stream it to the handheld device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-PlayStation-Portal"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-PlayStation-Portal" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the PlayStation Portal?"></a>Should You Buy the PlayStation Portal?</h2><p> If you’re a big PlayStation fan and find yourself missing your games whenever you’re not home, the PlayStation Portal is for you. With this handheld device, you basically take your PlayStation 5 with you wherever you are, as long as you have a robust 5G data connection.</p><p> However, the Portal will not work on slower data connections like 4G, so you have to consider that if your area doesn’t have that. Furthermore, it doesn’t have a browser, so the Portal won’t work with most hotel and public Wi-Fi infrastructure that require logging in via a browser.</p><p> If you don’t want to just stream PS5 games, you might be better off getting a smartphone gaming controller like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gamesir-x2s-type-c-controller-review/" >the GameSir X2s Type-C Controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . That way, you can use it for non-PlayStation services, like Steam and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or even for playing AAA games straight from your phone. Plus, these controllers cost less than $50.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-conquer-the-clouds-recording-and-preserving-streaming-radios/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Conquer the Clouds Recording and Preserving Streaming Radios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-keeping-score-with-your-xbox-one-screenshots/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Keeping Score with Your Xbox One Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-film-shoots-a-beginners-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Streamlining Film Shoots A Beginner's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/budget-friendly-signal-reception-with-amazonbasics-television-antenna-get-your-channels-for-free/"><u>Budget-Friendly Signal Reception with AmazonBasics Television Antenna - Get Your Channels for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/flawless-gaming-experience-solve-the-main-causes-of-video-game-collapses/"><u>Flawless Gaming Experience: Solve the Main Causes of Video Game Collapses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-new-download-tool-facebook-videos-for-all-oses/"><u>In 2024, New Download Tool Facebook Videos for All OSes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-synergy-of-social-media-embedding-linktree-in-your-tiktok-bio/"><u>In 2024, Synergy of Social Media Embedding Linktree in Your TikTok Bio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-ispoofer-alternative-to-try-on-infinix-smart-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Infinix Smart 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-itel-s23plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Itel S23+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/make-most-out-of-your-mac-with-switch-titles/"><u>Make Most Out of Your Mac with Switch Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/opening-up-the-gaming-giant-xbox-360-slim-exposed/"><u>Opening Up the Gaming Giant: Xbox 360 Slim Exposed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-gameplay-advanced-blue-ray-techniques-for-the-sx/"><u>Revolutionize Your Gameplay: Advanced Blue-Ray Techniques for the SX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/selecting-the-ultimate-3d-lights-for-your-console-zone/"><u>Selecting the Ultimate 3D Lights for Your Console Zone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/streamlining-playstation-5s-digital-shelf/"><u>Streamlining PlayStation 5'S Digital Shelf</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/1722894405581-unveiling-prospects-for-xiaomis-innovative-nothing-phone-3-cost-estimates-release-dates-and-specs/"><u>Unveiling Prospects for Xiaomi's Innovative Nothing Phone 3: Cost Estimates, Release Dates & Specs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/why-intels-latest-cores-may-not-be-as-great-as-they-seem/"><u>Why Intel's Latest Cores May Not Be as Great as They Seem</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

And of the first issues you’re likely to run into is how to bring up the Steam Deck’s on-screen keyboard. It’s not always as straightforward as it seems, as the Deck’s keyboard behaves a touch differently depending on how you’re using it.</p><p>Here’s how to bring up the Steam Deck in various scenarios.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Bring-Up-the-Steam-Deck-Keyboard-In-Game"><a href="#How-to-Bring-Up-the-Steam-Deck-Keyboard-In-Game" class="headerlink" title="How to Bring Up the Steam Deck Keyboard In-Game"></a>How to Bring Up the Steam Deck Keyboard In-Game</h2><p> If you need to type in a text field while in-game, selecting the field will usually bring up the Steam Deck’s keyboard.

If nothing is happening,<strong>hold Steam Button &gt; X</strong> (just one of several<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-shortcuts/" >secret Steam Deck shortcuts you need to know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ). The Steam Deck will appear at the bottom of the screen per usual.

The Steam Deck keyboard shortcut does not work in SteamOS so long as a text field is present on-screen (as of August 2023). Whether this is a bug or a feature yet to be implemented is unknown at this time.</p><p> But you don’t need to use this button combo anyway. To bring up the Steam Deck keyboard in SteamOS, select the text field where you want to type. The Steam Deck keyboard automatically appears every time.

Rolling back Windows will undo every system change made after a selected date.</p><p> As such, you can use System Restore to put your PC “back in time” to a moment when the error didn’t occur. It does mean you may lose some apps or data, so be sure to back up anything you want to keep.</p><p> Our guide to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/" >utilizing System Restore on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides step-by-step instructions for how to roll back Windows 10 and 11. Select a restore point date created before you needed to fix the “display driver failed to start” error.</p><p> If this fixes the problem, be careful when re-installing the apps and drivers that got wiped during the restore. If you do, keep tabs on what you reinstalled and when. If the “display driver failed to start” error resurfaces, uninstall everything you recently reinstalled.</p><h2 id="6-Perform-a-Windows-Factory-Reset"><a href="#6-Perform-a-Windows-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="6.

Performing a factory reset will likely fix the “display driver failed to start” error. However, factory resetting a PC deletes all the apps that weren’t pre-installed with Windows. So, be prepared to reinstall all third-party apps you installed yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/keep-my-files-option.jpg"                      alt="The Keep my Files option"                ></p><p> You can apply a factory reset with the Reset this PC utility.

Its camera setup is also powerful, combining a 50MP wide lens, 180MP periscope telephoto, and 50MP ultrawide into the triple-camera configuration.</p><p> One feature I really liked on the Honor Magic 6 Pro is the new drop and drag to search tools. Instead of having to long press, copy, paste, and so on, you drag and drop the information you need directly into the app you want. Someone sends you a location? Just drag it straight into Google Maps, and it loads immediately.</p><p> Finally, Honor’s second-generation silicon-carbon battery allows it to pack in a whopping 5,600mAh while keeping the Magic 6 Pro’s design slim and sleek; it’s a great bit of kit.</p><h2 id="3-Motorola-Adaptive-Display-Concept"><a href="#3-Motorola-Adaptive-Display-Concept" class="headerlink" title="3.

Motorola’s bendable, flexible, wearable is another interpretation of a smartphone that you can wrap around your wrist, displaying incredible flexibility considering all of the hardware packed into the body.</p><p> Whether this ultra-flexy smartphone ever becomes a real-world product is here nor there; the tech behind it is cool, and there is something futuristic about strapping your smartphone around your wrist.</p><p> The concept smartphone features a 6.9-inch pOLED screen. Most interestingly, the battery and other components are built in multiple segments to help the device achieve its bendiness.</p><h2 id="4-Tecno-Camon-30-Premier-5G"><a href="#4-Tecno-Camon-30-Premier-5G" class="headerlink" title="4.

Powering the Camon 30 Premier 5G is a Dimensity 8200 Ultra chip featuring eight cores paired with 12GB RAM and 512GB storage (plus a separate onboard GPU).</p><p>Close</p><p> The Camon 30 Premier 5G also comes equipped with a Sony ISP, which is a powerful AI imaging and processing chip that powers Tecno’s new PolarAce imaging system. It basically enables the Camon 30 Premier 5G to reduce noise in video capture, provide 4K Ultra Night Vision video, and powers its Universal Tone feature, designed to more accurately render skin tones.</p><p> Another plus point is the 6.77-inch screen, with a 1,264x2,780 resolution and a maximum brightness of 1,400 nits.

The Nubia Flip 5G is actually quite similar in design to the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tecno-phantom-v-flip-5g-review/" >Tecno Phantom V Flip 5G <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is no bad thing. ZTE has opted for a Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chip, which, while not as powerful as the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, still packs a powerful punch.</p><p>Close</p><p> The folding mechanism felt responsive, while the fold folds out properly to 180 degrees, which is nice. The 6.9-inch 120Hz display was perfectly responsive, though it’s always better to judge these things after the screen has been folded a bunch of times during regular use.</p><p> The budget flip-phone market is heating up, with strong entries like the ZTE Nubia Flip 5G and Tecno Phantom V Flip 5G battling it out with the Motorola Razr.</p><h2 id="6-Ayaneo-Pocket-S"><a href="#6-Ayaneo-Pocket-S" class="headerlink" title="6.

The screen has a 2560*1440 resolution with 490PPI and a maximum brightness of 400 nits. I have to say, it looks excellent.</p><p>Close</p><p> Also packed into that frame is the second reason the Ayaneo Pocket S is featured on this list: it ships with a brand new Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 chip, which enables top-tier gaming with just a 15W power draw. The Ayaneo Pocket S is one the world’s first gaming devices to use this new Snapdragon chip, delivering eight Kryo Prime Ultra 3.36GHz cores plus a dedicated 1GHz Adreno A32 GPU.</p><p> The Pocket S also features multiple performance modes, integrated vibration, RGB lighting on the Hall Sensing joysticks, and heaps of gaming integrations.</p><h2 id="7-Xiaomi-14-Ultra"><a href="#7-Xiaomi-14-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="7.

It’s not just the new sensor, though. The Ultra 14 ships with a quad-camera array, two telephoto lenses, and a variable aperture to give even more depth-of-field options to creators. It still comes with the Leica branding, and the housing works nicely on the rear of the device.</p><p>Close</p><p> Most importantly, it ships with the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and Xiaomi’s AISP neural chip, which the company claims to be the first AI computational model focusing solely on photography. There are four AI models to work with: FusionLM, ToneLM, ColorLM, and PortraitLM, each of which fine-tunes images snapped on the device.</p><p> Like Honor, Xiaomi has also made the jump to a new silicon carbon cell battery, which delivers greater power density.

Now, whether you’d want someone to see what you’re watching from the other side is a different question, but the full MicroLED screen delivers the goods.</p><p> Again, I’m slightly perturbed by the screen, but it’s a great transparent laptop design and easily one of the best iterations on this growing tech style launched so far.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-earn-big-on-youtube-shorts-tips-for-profitable-content-creation/"><u>[Updated] Earn Big on YouTube Shorts Tips for Profitable Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/1721434736849-avoid-the-misleading-google-bard-protect-your-device/"><u>Avoid the Misleading Google Bard — Protect Your Device!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/connect-xbox-to-laptop-a-guide-to-effective-gaming-display-setup/"><u>Connect Xbox to Laptop: A Guide to Effective Gaming Display Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/demystifying-and-resolving-4-predominant-gpu-problems/"><u>Demystifying and Resolving 4 Predominant GPU Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-hds-finest-picks-reviewing-top-screen-recorders/"><u>In 2024, HD's Finest Picks Reviewing Top Screen Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/playing-differently-now-how-steams-rules-reshape-ai-games/"><u>Playing Differently Now: How Steam's Rules Reshape AI Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/1723006649024-smooth-gaming-awaits-discover-the-ultimate-fix-for-diablo-iv-crashing-across-all-platforms/"><u>Smooth Gaming Awaits!

Helldivers 2, a game by Arrowhead Game Studios, exploded in popularity on PC and PS5 consoles in 2024. How can a future multiplayer game replicate Arrowhead’s success? Here are some key things I’ve noticed as a player that contribute to the game’s success.</p><h2 id="1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play"><a href="#1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play" class="headerlink" title="1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play"></a>1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0416461.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Super Earth public service announcement"                ></p><p> Helldivers 2 is a third-person shooter live service game where players become Helldivers fighting for Super Earth. Players join teammates in missions on different planets across the universe to eradicate Terminids (bug-like alien life forms) and Automatons (robots). Helldivers harvest valuable resources from planets that are home to Terminids and Automatons.</p><p> Gamers can play Helldivers 2 on the PlayStation 5 and PC. One of the keys to a successful multiplayer game is ensuring that even if your friend has a PC, but you only have a PlayStation, you’ll still be able to join each other in the interplanetary fight for democracy in Helldivers 2.</p><p> Cross-platform multiplayer features allow people to play games with friends who may use different platforms and maintain social connections while increasing the overall player pool. It’s one of the reasons<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/platform-exclusive-games-thing-of-the-past-good/" >platform-exclusive games are becoming a thing of the past <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Listen-to-Community-Members"><a href="#2-Listen-to-Community-Members" class="headerlink" title="2 Listen to Community Members"></a>2 Listen to Community Members</h2><p> Months after launch, Sony announced that PC players would have to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to their Steam account to continue playing Helldivers 2 with multiplayer functionality. This created an uproar across the Helldivers 2 player base, which caused Sony to backtrack on its decision only two days later.</p><p> This outcry resulted in more than 150,000 negative reviews on the<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS%5F2/#app%5Freviews%5Fhash" >Helldivers 2 Steam page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (with some reviews reversed after the policy change). Despite Sony backtracking on this decision, Helldivers 2 is still currently delisted in countries that do not have access to PSN accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415451.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Warbond menu"                ></p><p> The game was faced with alienating a large portion of its player base, but its willingness to reverse its decision got it back on track.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence"><a href="#3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence" class="headerlink" title="3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence"></a>3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence</h2><p> The Helldivers 2 social media pages post frequent game updates, challenges, and memes that earn impressive engagement. For instance, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/helldivers2game/?hl=en" >Helldivers 2 Instagram page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> boasts over 100,000 followers.</p><p> Helldivers 2 also has a<a class="link"   href="https://discord.com/invite/zbbZ5rNcuK" >Discord server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with almost 1 million members, where players receive updates from the game’s developers.

One recent Major Order required the game’s player base to kill 2 million Terminids to receive in-game currency called medals.</p><p> The game’s developers put out new Major Orders every week to engage the community. The community is not guaranteed to pass each Major Order, making it a challenge for the entire player base. Each mission in Helldivers 2 that a player participates in adds to the progress of the Major Order, making the success of the mission entirely based on community progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System"><a href="#5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System" class="headerlink" title="5 Have a Free Progression System"></a>5 Have a Free Progression System</h2><p> There are multiple forms of in-game currency in Helldivers 2 which players can find in missions for free. If a player is looking to fast-track unlocking items available in Warbonds (battle passes), weapons, and other cosmetics, there are paid options, as well. Importantly, a player does not have to pay to advance in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415430.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Acquisition Center"                ></p><p> Players can find Super Credits, which unlock new monthly Warbonds and cosmetics, across missions at random points on the map. Super Credits are also available for purchase in the game store. Medals can be obtained by completing Major Orders or finding stashes during missions. You can also earn medals by completing missions. The higher the difficulty level of the mission, the more medals players unlock upon completion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415072.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Super Credits store"                ></p><p> There are also samples scattered across each mission depending on the difficulty level. Players can trade in these samples to upgrade their ships and stratagems, which are mission call-ins and weapons, such as airstrikes and turrets. Finally, requisition slips pop up, which players earn by completing missions or locating points of interest on the map, which unlock new stratagems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415051.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 strategem menu"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> There are plenty of other<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/live-service-games-that-arent-pay-to-win/" >live service games that are not pay-to-win <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well, including Fortnite and Smite.</p><h2 id="6-Balance-Gameplay-Mechanics"><a href="#6-Balance-Gameplay-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="6 Balance Gameplay Mechanics"></a>6 Balance Gameplay Mechanics</h2><p> With new weapons, armor, and emotes dropping monthly, game developers watch to see if these newer weapons are over- or under-powered based on gameplay and community feedback.</p><p> For example, the SG-225 Breaker shotgun got “nerfed”, meaning the game developers reduced its overall power by reducing its ammo capacity and increasing its recoil to balance the game and encourage using other weapons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0504130.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 SG-225 Breaker automatic shotgun"                ></p><p> Balancing game mechanics helps keep the experience varied and allows people to use different combinations of guns and other strategies to succeed in the game.</p><p> The success of Helldivers 2 offers insight into the future of successful online multiplayer games that span console, PC, and mobile gaming. Listening and communicating with the player base, having free progression mechanics, and allowing cross-platform play are some important qualities that turned Helldivers 2 into a global sensation.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hearnow-podcast-and-speaker-assessment/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved HearNow Podcast and Speaker Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-a-closer-look-at-asuss-proart-pa-329q-an-in-depth-review-of-its-professional-standards-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Closer Look at Asus's ProArt PA 329Q – An In-Depth Review of Its Professional Standards for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-harmonic-highlights-the-right-song-for-your-ig-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] Harmonic Highlights The Right Song for Your IG Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-media-professionals-recommendations-best-5-web-video-recorders/"><u>[New] Media Professionals' Recommendations Best 5 Web Video Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-the-nuances-of-audio-overlap-crossfade/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exploring the Nuances of Audio Overlap (Crossfade)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bring-your-games-closer-with-playnite-fullscreen-tv/"><u>Bring Your Games Closer with Playnite Fullscreen TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/compact-and-sturdy-2024s-finest-holders-for-switch/"><u>Compact and Sturdy: 2024'S Finest Holders for Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/customize-your-controls-the-perfect-dpi-level-for-shooters/"><u>Customize Your Controls: The Perfect DPI Level for Shooters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discord-for-mac-users-step-by-step-setup-instructions/"><u>Discord for Mac Users: Step-by-Step Setup Instructions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/enhance-user-experience-with-cookiebot-technology/"><u>Enhance User Experience with Cookiebot Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/expert-tips-to-correct-helldivers-2-initialization-issue-no-more-black-screens/"><u>Expert Tips to Correct Helldivers 2 Initialization Issue – No More Black Screens!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gamers-choice-analyzing-the-pros-and-cons-of-game-downloads/"><u>Gamer's Choice: Analyzing the Pros & Cons of Game Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/its-suitable-for-precise-applications-requiring-clean-high-quality-welds/"><u>It's Suitable for Precise Applications Requiring Clean, High-Quality Welds.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/master-gamers-guide-setting-up-windows-on-steam-deck/"><u>Master Gamer's Guide: Setting up Windows on Steam Deck</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/revolutionize-your-arcade-with-expansive-front-ends/"><u>Revolutionize Your Arcade with Expansive Front Ends!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/streamline-gaming-with-epic-and-steam-integration/"><u>Streamline Gaming with Epic and Steam Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/successfully-importing-mov-files-into-vegas-pro-a-troubleshooting-guide/"><u>Successfully Importing MOV Files Into Vegas Pro: A Troubleshooting Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Foddian games result from taking the core platformer concept and cranking the difficulty up to 11.</p><p> As a result, Foddian games are some of the most challenging titles currently available. But what are they exactly? What is the origin of the name and the concept behind these games? Also, how far has this base concept evolved to accommodate newer, unique titles?

Here are some events that led to a platform game revolution, birthing the Foddian genre as we know and love it.</p><h3 id="The-First-Bennet-Foddy-Game"><a href="#The-First-Bennet-Foddy-Game" class="headerlink" title="The First Bennet Foddy Game"></a>The First Bennet Foddy Game</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-getting-over-it.jpg"                      alt="A guy in a pot holding a sledgehammer who is about to fall off a cliff"                ></p><p> It all began with the Foddian game, “Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy”. Getting Over It is a puzzle game that challenges the player to use a sledgehammer to propel themselves up steep ledges and across slick platforms to get to space. “Foddian” refers to the creator of the first game, Bennett Foddy, in this genre and represents titles of a similar format.</p><p> There are a few reasons why this title still has a grip on the platforming scene. The first is that it mixes well with the speedrun format. A player can decide to try to finish the game as quickly as possible after mastering the basic mechanics.</p><p> Another attribute of Getting Over It’s success is the sheer difficulty and the entertainment tied to watching people either fail or succeed. Popular creators like Ludwig and CdawgVA saw the content potential and have helped popularize this title.</p><p> Getting Over It wasn’t the first platformer, but it created a format that has been improved upon in newer games that fall under the Foddian genre. Bennet Foddy pioneered an era of gaming, whether he intended to or not, and complex puzzle platforming games are better for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-Rise-of-Jump-King"><a href="#The-Rise-of-Jump-King" class="headerlink" title="The Rise of Jump King"></a>The Rise of Jump King</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3-jump-king.jpg"                      alt="The Jump King lying flat on a mossy platform after falling"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1155462">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1155462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1155462%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1155462/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jump King is a title that transcends the Foddian game genre. You may have heard about the game thanks to its tendency to be played live on Twitch streams. Speedrunners are especially fond of the small series of Jump King games.</p><p> The player starts at the bottom of a tall path, at the pinnacle of which stands a majestic babe. Evidently, the goal of the game is for the player to jump from platform to platform all the way to the top.</p><p> Jump King is an excellent game for content creation because it is easy to gauge a player’s progress, making it easier for viewers to follow along. It is also relatively easy to run and could offset how much a streamer needs to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-optimize-game-streams-using-obs-studio/" >optimize their game streams using OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Almost every popular streamer and YouTuber you can think of has played Jump King to some extent, indirectly marketing the game to their viewers. As such, it didn’t take long for a community to spawn around this game, and it remains one of the most played in its genre.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135419/19272" target="_top" id="2135419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135419/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Foddian-Games-and-Content-Creation"><a href="#Foddian-Games-and-Content-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Foddian Games and Content Creation"></a>Foddian Games and Content Creation</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/4-streamer.jpg"                      alt="A streaming setup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Streaming goes beyond just playing a game. Streamers understand that they need to engage their chat as much as possible to keep interest high. Fortunately, Foddian games are the perfect gateway for viewer engagement.</p><p> A player still needs to focus on the game, especially when speedrunning it. However, the punishment for responding to chat is not so severe as to ruin your game. In other titles, like shooters or racers, you may end up dying to an opponent or losing a race if you are distracted.</p><p> Ultimately, Foddian games are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-interact-with-subscribers-followers/" >a great way to interact with your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and let your personality shine. Some popular creators who have tried this include Ludwig, CdawgVA, Apharad, and Ironmouse. What’s more, there’s a high chance that your favorite creator has played some popular Foddian titles like Getting Over It, Pogostuck, Only Up!, or Jump King.</p><h2 id="The-Evolution-of-Foddian-Games"><a href="#The-Evolution-of-Foddian-Games" class="headerlink" title="The Evolution of Foddian Games"></a>The Evolution of Foddian Games</h2><p> Getting Over It created an exciting format that other game developers have explored to varying extents. A few other games fall into this genre, but only a couple have left a mark on the community.</p><p> For instance, Pogostuck was the next big release after Bennet Foddy’s original title. The game was released with different movement mechanics and overall design. However, it was just as difficult, if not more so.</p><p> Many Foddian games are 2D, but the genre isn’t limited to that representation. A great example of this is Only Up!—this game captures the ambiance of the Foddian genre in a 3D format. As such, it can be incredibly challenging but satisfying.</p><p> Only Up! has become popular enough to dominate the viewership on Twitch for concurrent weeks. And while the hype is not the same as it was during release, many people still actively play the title.</p><h2 id="Foddian-Games-Difficult-but-Rewarding-Platforming"><a href="#Foddian-Games-Difficult-but-Rewarding-Platforming" class="headerlink" title="Foddian Games: Difficult but Rewarding Platforming"></a>Foddian Games: Difficult but Rewarding Platforming</h2><p> There is a gradual shift in the type of video game content enjoyed live on stream or alone on a slow Saturday afternoon.</p><p> While Foddian games are simple in design, the execution is magnificently intricate. They present a fun challenge for players, one you can ride all the way to victory at the top of the map.</p><h2 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" class="headerlink" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h2><h3 id="Q-What-Games-Are-Similar-to-Getting-Over-It-With-Bennett-Foddy"><a href="#Q-What-Games-Are-Similar-to-Getting-Over-It-With-Bennett-Foddy" class="headerlink" title="Q: What Games Are Similar to Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy?"></a>Q: What Games Are Similar to Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy?</h3><p> Within the genre of Foddian games, numerous titles emulate the addicting frustration of games like Getting Over With Bennett Foddy. Of these games, titles like QWOP, an aggravating sprinting game in which you need to order every limb of your runner to move, or the classic browser game Happy Wheels, are some of the most popular Foddian-like games. That said, tons of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-hardest-games-in-the-whole-wide-world/" >difficult browser games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also provide a similar Foddian experience.</p><h3 id="Q-How-Long-Is-Only-Up"><a href="#Q-How-Long-Is-Only-Up" class="headerlink" title="Q: How Long Is Only Up!?"></a>Q: How Long Is Only Up!?</h3><p> A popular Foddian game, Only Up! takes around 40 to 120 minutes to complete. However, because of the game’s difficulty, it will more than likely take quite a lot longer than the listed competition time, especially due to a lack of checkpoints. Because of this, you may be looking at a completion time of around four to five hours depending on your skill level.</p><h3 id="Q-Who-Popularized-the-Only-Up-Game"><a href="#Q-Who-Popularized-the-Only-Up-Game" class="headerlink" title="Q: Who Popularized the Only Up!

Game?</h3><p> While Only Up! was popularized by streaming communities, if you’re wondering which streamer first brought the game to a larger audience, KaiCenet first played Only Up! on the ninth of June 2023, to an audience of 55.8 thousand viewers. From this point on, the popularity of Only Up!, much like other Foddian games, grew exponentially within gaming communities.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/winx-mediatrans-100/"><u>[安心お得] WinX MediaTrans認定購入ページ - 100%安全なオンラインショッピング体験</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-screencast-creators-handbook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Screencast Creator's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-call-transcript-for-study/"><u>[Updated] Capture Call Transcript for Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-your-macs-display-live-easy-steps-included/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capturing Your Mac's Display Live - Easy Steps Included</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-microsoft-unveils-future-a-3d-reality-with-hololens/"><u>[Updated] Microsoft Unveils Future A 3D Reality With HoloLens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reversing-the-flow-a-guide-to-tracing-instagram-pics-backwards/"><u>2024 Approved Reversing the Flow A Guide to Tracing Instagram Pics Backwards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-weave-wisdom-mastering-looms-screen-capture/"><u>2024 Approved Weave Wisdom Mastering Loom’s Screen Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/dance-the-cursor-tablets-for-rhythmic-play/"><u>Dance the Cursor: Tablets for Rhythmic Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/intense-close-ups-in-minecraft-five-simple-steps-for-2024/"><u>Intense Close-Ups in Minecraft Five Simple Steps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/next-gen-gaming-made-easy-with-budget-pc-motherboards/"><u>Next-Gen Gaming Made Easy with Budget PC Motherboards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/optimizing-gameplay-with-steams-external-drive-support/"><u>Optimizing Gameplay with Steam's External Drive Support</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/quiet-gaming-technique-eliminate-xbox-s-controller-shakes/"><u>Quiet Gaming Technique: Eliminate Xbox S Controller Shakes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/streamline-gameplay-with-smart-use-of-steam-badges/"><u>Streamline Gameplay with Smart Use of Steam Badges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unauthorized-xbox-gamepads-what-this-means-for-player-rights/"><u>Unauthorized Xbox Gamepads: What This Means for Player Rights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unmatched-selection-of-premium-xbox-capture-cards/"><u>Unmatched Selection of Premium Xbox Capture Cards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/vivo-y100i-not-connecting-to-wi-fi-12-quick-ways-to-fix-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Vivo Y100i Not Connecting to Wi-Fi? 12 Quick Ways to Fix | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While we’ve seen more surprising and eye-catching releases from Tecno, including their recent Phantom V Fold, this year’s event in Berlin focuses on refreshing their popular laptop lineup with increased portability and personality.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Tecno is unveiling two new laptops, the Tecno Megabook T1 2023 14-inch and the Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition, with an emphasis on portability and personality.</li><li>The Tecno Megabook T1 14” offers a smaller form factor but manages to surprise with even more impressive battery life, with a larger battery and claims of up to 18.5 hours of runtime.</li><li>The Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition uses polychromatic photoisomer technology, revealing a pixel font pattern when exposed to UV light.

You’d think downsizing from a 15.6” chassis to a smaller 14” would also result in sacrificed battery capacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-t1.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook T1"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> While its thickness of 14.8mm remains unchanged from last year’s Megabook 15.6”, the new T1 14” is lighter at 1.39kg (vs 1.48kg) and manages to fit a larger 75Wh (vs 70Wh) battery which claims to provide 1 hour of extra runtime at up to 18.5 hours. For fast charging, you’ll find the same 65W GaN power adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-t1-2.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook T1-2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972665/19272" target="_top" id="1972665">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972665" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972665/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Although the smaller 14” display may not seem as appealing if you prefer having extra screen real estate, the T1 14” has upgraded to a 16:10 aspect ratio with a screen-to-body ratio of 90%, and still provides 100%sRGB color and TUV eye protection. Rounding off this new model, it retains the Red Dot Design Award from last year with its “premium aluminum metallic body,” offering a great balance of portability, performance, and the largest battery in its price range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tecno-Megabook-S1-Dazzling-Edition"><a href="#Tecno-Megabook-S1-Dazzling-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition"></a>Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition</h2><p> Rather than a complete redesign, TECNO showcased a concept special, “Dazzling” edition S1. While its chassis and internals remain unchanged, the S1 Dazzling’s top lid and wrist pad area get a subtle tech&#x2F;magic makeover.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-display.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Display"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Using polychromatic photoisomer, in its White Moon color, the monochrome surface of the S1 can reveal colors when exposed to UV light. To demo this for us, they shined a UV flashlight over the surface for a few seconds to reveal “MEGABOOK S1” written in pixel font along the right side of the top lid. First seen on the Camon 19 Pro Mondrian Edition smartphone which launched last year, Tecno is expanding this technology to their other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-keyboard-deck.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Keyboard Deck"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139117/17108" target="_top" id="2139117">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139117" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139117/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> While the effect wasn’t as pronounced inside during their booth presentation, I imagine longer exposure to the sun would really highlight this change in appearance. Additionally, while this remains a concept product and pricing hasn’t been announced, we suspect that Techno is looking to bring its unique technology in at a similar affordable starting price point as the standard Megabook S1. It’s unclear what customization users will have over the displayed text or designs, though just as with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 with its AniMe Matrix Display on its lid, the S1 Dazzling Edition will likely find its fan base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-top-lid.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Top Lid"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972693/19272" target="_top" id="1972693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tecno’s-New-Laptops-Dazzle-at-IFA-2023"><a href="#Tecno’s-New-Laptops-Dazzle-at-IFA-2023" class="headerlink" title="Tecno’s New Laptops Dazzle at IFA 2023"></a>Tecno’s New Laptops Dazzle at IFA 2023</h2><p> IFA 2023 often reveals the best new laptops you’ll see throughout the next year, and this year’s edition was no different.

But whereas most handheld gaming systems today play retro games, this is something else entirely.</p><p> Picture Valve’s Steam Deck, then imagine how it might be running Windows and twice the processing power. That’s what you get with the GPD Win 4, a system that doesn’t only play the latest AAA titles on Steam, Epic, and Xbox Game Pass, it also lets you run classic titles. If your chosen emulation platform runs on Windows, you can play those old games on the GPD Win 4.</p><p> In fact, apart from a few console titles, you can play most games ever released on this device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528693/16446" target="_top" id="1528693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528693/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="It’s-Like-a-Steam-Deck-With-a-Physical-Keyboard"><a href="#It’s-Like-a-Steam-Deck-With-a-Physical-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="It’s Like a Steam Deck With a Physical Keyboard"></a>It’s Like a Steam Deck With a Physical Keyboard</h2><p>One of the most stunning features of this device is the keyboard.</p><p> Hidden behind the display, the keyboard is there for a reason—but I’m not 100% certain what that reason is. The keys are too small for proper typing, after all, and in this day and age of multi-form factor devices and onscreen keyboards, it seems superfluous. Gamers tend towards headsets and voice chat for multiplayer, so the physical keyboard just doesn’t seem necessary for messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-kb.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 with keyboard open"                ></p><p> When keys are required, connecting a keyboard seems smarter; an onscreen keyboard should be adequate in most cases.</p><p> That said, the action on the display’s sliding motion is nice. It feels like using a classic Windows Mobile phone, but this is arguably a direct lineage of “Pocket PC,” regardless of how many iterations and companies it took to get there.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-Ship-With"><a href="#What-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-Ship-With" class="headerlink" title="What Does the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld Ship With?"></a>What Does the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld Ship With?</h2><p> Cracking open the GPD Win 4 box reveals a modest collection of kit. Aside from the Sony PlayStation Portable-esque main device, there is a wrist strap, screen protector, and USB Type-C mains power adapter.</p><p> The cable detaches from the charger (it’s USB Type-C at both ends) which makes it pretty flexible for most scenarios. Sadly, there’s no case or even a small tote bag with this handheld. Accessories are available for the device, however, including a case.</p><h2 id="GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-System-Specification"><a href="#GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-System-Specification" class="headerlink" title="GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld System Specification"></a>GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld System Specification</h2><p> The specification for this handheld PC will surprise you. For context, it measures 220 x 92 x 28mm (8.66 x 3.62 x 1.1 inches), and weighs 598g (21.1oz). Inside its PSP-inspired chassis, you’ll find an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U with AMD Radeon 680M graphics, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD with Windows 11 pre-installed. The OS ensures all expected video, audio, and picture formats are playable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-left-power.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 power button"                ></p><p> It supports 802.11ax Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6&#x2F;6E) with 2.4 and 5GHz bands, and a dual channel maximum transmission rate of 2402Mbps. For audio and controllers, Bluetooth 5.2 is supported.</p><p> A single USB 4 Type-C port supporting a data rate of 40Gbps is featured, along with a 3.5mm audio port. That port is on the top of the console for connectivity; the power port is on the lower side of the device. A USB 3 Type-A port is also provided, along with a TF slot for removable microSD card storage. Power and volume buttons are also provided.</p><p> The Li-polymer battery requires the 65-watt USB Type-C charger, although substitutes (e.g. laptop, Steam Deck) will work.</p><p> While the listed hardware states the presence of an HDMI port, the model we reviewed does not have this. Instead, video out is via the USB Type C port on the top of the console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-usbc.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 USB Type-C port"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The Corning Gorilla Glass 5 display is a 6-inch H-IPS with 1080p resolution, 368PPI, and refresh rate options of 40Hz and 60Hz.

Sliding the display up reveals the keyboard; no other controls are hidden.</p><h2 id="USB-Type-C-Expansion-Options-Turn-It-Into-a-PC"><a href="#USB-Type-C-Expansion-Options-Turn-It-Into-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="USB Type C Expansion Options Turn It Into a PC"></a>USB Type C Expansion Options Turn It Into a PC</h2><p> With a suitable hub attached, the GPD Win 4 supports various expansions. Game controllers, printers, and input devices—they’re all compatible. You can watch videos, listen to music, and read eBooks.</p><p> Find a suitable hub, and you can leave it plugged into your HDMI display and set up as a home console. When you’re ready to leave the house, unplugging that single USB Type-C cable makes the GPD Win 4 portable again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-ports.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 USB ports"                ></p><p> Offering support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB, you can hook up anything you would to a desktop computer. It doesn’t look like an office PC, but the GPD Win 4 is probably more powerful than the Dell on your desk at work.</p><p> Note that there is also a USB Type A 3.0 port on the console. This is suitable for everything from external storage to additional peripherals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-of-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-of-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort of the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld"></a>Design and Comfort of the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld</h2><p> Available in various colors, I received the white version of the GPD Win 4 for review. It features a matte finish, which aids grip, although the two rear buttons are difficult to reach. The console isn’t as wide as a Steam Deck, and not as comfortable to use.</p><p> The GPD Win 4 has two thumbsticks, XYBA, D-Pad, dual shoulder buttons, and dual triggers, both left and right. In addition, the device features a Start button, Select button, and clickable mouse trackpad. A swift press acts as the left-click; a longer press corresponds to a right-click. This last feature is a necessity for PC gaming, but this implementation is often unwieldy. It’s also mostly useless for arcade&#x2F;FPS gaming, although it does work with strategy titles where fast reactions are less important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-right-control.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 controller right"                ></p><p> For any game that requires “controller mode” a useful switch is situated on the left side of the console. This enables the thumbsticks and buttons to work as they would if you had plugged an Xbox controller into a PC.</p><p> The GPD Win 4 also has supports rear-mounted expansions. At the time of writing, only a 4G LTE radio is available, which clips onto the back of the console. The mounting points can be seen in the molding of the chassis, which sports echoes of the Sony PSP handheld.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-left-trigger.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 left trigger"                ></p><p> RGB LEDs cycle through a color change beneath the two clear shoulder buttons, changing how you might perceive the console. But when the color turns green, this white handheld feels like a portable Xbox 360.</p><h2 id="Testing-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld"><a href="#Testing-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld" class="headerlink" title="Testing the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld"></a>Testing the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld</h2><p> I selected four games (all on Steam) to measure this device. How did they work out?</p><ul><li>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order (2019): the popular third-person action RPG plays perfectly on this system, with little difference in graphics from the Xbox One version.</li><li>DOOM Eternal: (2020) this stonkingly good first-person shooter (FPS) plays fantastically well, and the handheld device doesn’t hurt the performance.</li><li>Beyond the Long Night (2023): a screen-by-screen retro-style adventure, this quirky pixel graphic adventure game plays perfectly well on the GPD Win 4, and boasts striking original audio.</li><li>Old World (2022): a Civilization-style isometric strategy game. In handheld mode this is almost unplayable. The screen is too small and while Steam offers a zoom feature, this is unwieldy on the GPD Win 4 (and isn’t much better on the Steam Deck either, despite the larger display, so no surprises here).</li></ul><p> I like the controls on the device, which all seem to be where you would need them (apart from the ones on the back). The menu buttons are a different matter (see below).</p><p> In terms of audio, the onboard speakers are a bit on the tinny size, but it sounds fine over a wired or Bluetooth headset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Compare-to-a-Steam-Deck"><a href="#How-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Compare-to-a-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="How Does the GPD Win 4 Compare to a Steam Deck?"></a>How Does the GPD Win 4 Compare to a Steam Deck?</h2><p> I’ve been using the Steam Deck since 2022, during which time it has become my main console. The reason for this is its pure flexibility, enabling me to game in any room in the house, or beyond if the mood takes me.</p><p> On paper, the GPD Win 4 offers the same flexibility, with roughly the same battery life. While in practice, this is mostly true, it has three key differences.</p><p> First, the GPD Win 4 is undeniably more powerful than the Steam Deck. Second, it runs Windows 11, an OS that while widely used, I dislike intensely. While running Steam in Big Picture mode can fool you into thinking you’re using a Steam Deck, it’s a short-lived illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-compare.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 vs Steam Deck"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Third, and perhaps most important, is that the GPD Win 4 doesn’t feel as comfortable as the Steam Deck. In fact, I’d go as far as to say it’s akin to playing games on a house brick.</p><p> Those rear buttons are a pain to reach, the Select and Start buttons are too small, and the mouse-to-controller toggle is easy to catch. That can cause some problems mid-game, let me tell you.</p><h2 id="The-GPD-Win-4-Lets-You-Play-Anywhere-for-a-Price"><a href="#The-GPD-Win-4-Lets-You-Play-Anywhere-for-a-Price" class="headerlink" title="The GPD Win 4 Lets You Play Anywhere, for a Price"></a>The GPD Win 4 Lets You Play Anywhere, for a Price</h2><p> At the most basic level, this handheld PC lets you play recent AAA titles on the go. That in itself is amazing, and with the controller layout, you get to enjoy seamless console-style gaming.</p><p> With the Windows 11 operating system, you benefit from compatibility with almost every PC games platform, plus PC Game Pass. The GPD Win 4’s fast Wi-Fi, meanwhile, delivers reliable performance on any number of game streaming services.</p><p> Heavy, bulky, and rough, it will play almost any game you throw at it, but the GPD Win 4 just isn’t that comfortable to use. After an hour of play, my hands were cramping, and I yearned for my Steam Deck.</p><p> While I could easily hook up an Xbox One-style controller, that illustrates the point: those controllers are ergonomic, and easy to hold. They make you happy to keep playing. Similarly, the larger Steam Deck is easy on the hands compared with this device.</p><p> Hardware-wise, the GPD Win 4 is a Steam Deck killer, and battery life aside, delivers portable PC and console-level gaming. Comfort-wise, however, it only delivers hand cramps.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-free-licensed-soundtracks-for-gamers-a-complete-list/"><u>[Updated] Free, Licensed Soundtracks for Gamers - A Complete List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-expert-insights-adjusting-tempo-for-optimal-snapchat-viewing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Expert Insights Adjusting Tempo for Optimal Snapchat Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-short-track-speed-skating-olympics-2022-highlights-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Short Track Speed Skating Olympics 2022 Highlights for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-choosing-between-obs-and-streamlabs-for-broadcast-excellence/"><u>2024 Approved Choosing Between OBS and Streamlabs for Broadcast Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoiding-common-pitfalls-on-the-journey-to-starfield/"><u>Avoiding Common Pitfalls on the Journey to Starfield</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elite-high-density-graphics-mice-packs/"><u>Elite High Density Graphics Mice Packs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/essential-propeller-choices-mastering-flight-excellence-for-2024/"><u>Essential Propeller Choices Mastering Flight Excellence for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gaming-controls-explained-buttons-for-android-devices/"><u>Gaming Controls Explained: Buttons for Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/get-hooked-on-these-6-non-monetary-gaming-treasures/"><u>Get Hooked on These 6 Non-Monetary Gaming Treasures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-poco-f5-pro-5g-mirror-screen-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Poco F5 Pro 5G Mirror Screen to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgot-pattern-lock-heres-how-you-can-unlock-honor-90-gt-pattern-lock-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgot Pattern Lock?

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives.

There’s a certain type of SSD that Sony requires. More specifically, you’ll need a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD with a heatsink. That’s a lot of jargon, I know. But the good news is, pretty much every company that makes SSDs has an SSD that’ll work with and is advertised for the PS5. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-games/"><strong>The best PS5 games</strong></a></p><p>I used a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P2T0CW/dp/B09JHKSNNG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C35c5e9a9-34c0-4827-9f6b-00a31f898678%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung 980 Pro with Heatsink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that meets all of Sony’s requirements and comes in various storage capacities. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy an SSD that has a heatsink already attached, you can buy a third-party option.
