With Xbox Series X, you can guarantee you can reach native 4K gaming with just a few steps. But how do you enable native 4K Xbox gaming? Let’s find out.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Check-if-You-Can-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#How-to-Check-if-You-Can-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Check if You Can Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X"></a>How to Check if You Can Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X</h2><p> To be able to game with native 4K visuals on Xbox Series X, your setup needs to meet a few specifications. In other words, you need 4K compatible devices to enable the feature on your Xbox. Specifically, your Xbox setup needs to include the following:</p><ul><li>An Xbox Series X console.</li><li>A TV that supports HDMI 2.1.</li><li>An HDMI 2.1 cable that connects your console to your TV.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/feature-1.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of someone holding an Xbox Wireless Controller in front of a monitor"                ></p><p> Luckily, the standard HDMI cable that comes with your Series X is HDMI 2.1, but if you have had to replace your cable, you will need to ensure you replace it with another HDMI 2.1 cable to guarantee 4K gaming. If you want to check whether your setup is correct, you can use your Xbox Series X to do so by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the<strong>Xbox button</strong> to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X.</li><li>Highlight<strong>Profile &amp; system</strong> , and select<strong>Settings</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-guide-menu.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Guide menu on Xbox Series X with the options for Profile and System highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Under<strong>General</strong> , select<strong>TV &amp; display options</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tv-and-display-options.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the General settings on Xbox Series X with TV and Display Options highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Select<strong>4K TV details</strong> .</li></ul><p> From<strong>4K TV details</strong> , your Xbox will list every requisite your setup meets when it comes to 4K compatibility.

Game Pass is a digital subscription service that gives you access to an ever-expanding catalog of over 250 games, plus exclusive discounts and deals.</p><p> Xbox Game Pass is available for console and PC and features numerous subscription tiers. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can even give you access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, so you can stream games to your smartphone or PC from the cloud.</p><p> But all the information associated with Game Pass can be overwhelming. So if you’re looking for the rundown on Xbox Game Pass and all its features, we can help.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass"><a href="#What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass" class="headerlink" title="What Is Xbox Game Pass?"></a>What Is Xbox Game Pass?</h2><p> Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service from Microsoft that launched in 2017 for Xbox consoles and 2019 for PC. Game Pass gives you access to a library of over 250 games to play for a monthly fee. You can play as many of these games as long as you like until your subscription expires, or the game leaves the library.</p><p> However, there are multiple kinds of Xbox Game Pass membership, and each comes with its own benefits and features. But overall, the available Xbox Game Pass tiers are as follows:</p><ul><li>Xbox Game Pass Core.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass for Console.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass for PC.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</li></ul><p> The standard tiers of Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass for Console or PC, come with similar benefits that summarize the features of Xbox Game Pass. To be specific Xbox Game Pass for Console and Xbox Game Pass for PC come with the following:</p><ul><li>Full access to the Xbox Game Pass library of games, as listed by<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass/games" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>New Xbox Games Studio titles are available on day one of release.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass deals and discounts for the Xbox Store.</li></ul><p> But even then, Xbox Game Pass for Console or PC is platform specific, if you play PC games you will need to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass for PC. Game Pass for PC also comes with access to EA Play, while Console does not.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass-Core"><a href="#What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass-Core" class="headerlink" title="What Is Xbox Game Pass Core?"></a>What Is Xbox Game Pass Core?</h2><p> Aside from the standard tiers of Xbox Game Pass, the lowest and cheapest tier available to you, is Xbox Game Pass Core. Xbox Game Pass Core represents Xbox’s replacement for the legacy service: Xbox Live Gold, and attempts to merge online services with Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gamepasscore-grey-logo-29ec9c6e6367df1bf5b3.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for Xbox Game Pass Core displaying the logo"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/17/xbox-game-pass-core/" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Specifically, Xbox Game Pass Core comes with the following benefits and features:</p><ul><li>Access to over 25 games from the Xbox Game Pass catalog, as listed via<a class="link"   href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/17/xbox-game-pass-core/" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Access to online multiplayer for your Xbox Console.</li><li>Game Pass Core also provides the same deals and discounts for the Xbox Store as other tiers.</li></ul><p> The key factor of Xbox Game Pass Core, then, is that the service attaches Game Pass access to being able to game online on your Xbox, though at a much-reduced level when compared to other tiers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate"><a href="#What-Is-Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate" class="headerlink" title="What Is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?"></a>What Is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?</h2><p> In direct contrast to Xbox Game Pass Core, the highest and most expensive tier of Xbox Game Pass is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Along with all the benefits of other tiers, Game Pass Ultimate includes:</p><ul><li>The ability to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/game-pass-perks-explained/" >claim Xbox Game Pass perks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Access to both Xbox Game Pass for Console and Xbox Game Pass for PC.</li><li>Xbox Cloud Gaming access, so you can stream Game Pass titles to your smartphone or PC.</li><li>Like Xbox Game Pass for PC, Ultimate also includes EA Play access.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/xbox-game-pass-stock-image.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for the advertisement of Xbox Game Pass and Xbox All Access"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While some of the benefits of Ultimate may seem trivial, having access to PC and Console Game Pass and Cloud Gaming, can be an essential benefit.</p><p> However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-game-pass-vs-game-pass-ultimate-upgrading/" >whether you should upgrade to Xbox Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or initially choose it, will entirely depend on where and how you want to game. If you are solely a console gamer, it’s unlikely the inclusion of PC Game Pass will sway you.</p><h2 id="What-Games-Do-I-Get-With-Xbox-Game-Pass"><a href="#What-Games-Do-I-Get-With-Xbox-Game-Pass" class="headerlink" title="What Games Do I Get With Xbox Game Pass?"></a>What Games Do I Get With Xbox Game Pass?</h2><p> Now you know the features of each Game Pass tier and its benefits, let’s look at the specifics of the service as a whole.</p><p> In terms of games, titles are constantly being added and removed from Xbox Game Pass every month, but if you want to see a current library of all the available games, a quick check of<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass/games" >the official Xbox site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can reveal all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/game-pass-in-games-and-apps.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the My Games and Apps section of an Xbox Series X with the dedicated Xbox Game Pass section highlighted"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> But even with the revolving roster, there are always hundreds of games included in Xbox Game Pass. These include Xbox 360 games (that can be played on Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One), Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One titles, and PC games. However, some games are only compatible with either Xbox or PC.</p><p> Although, if you are an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you won’t have to worry about platform restrictions, as you can access games like Sea of Thieves on both PC and Xbox consoles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-Does-Xbox-Game-Pass-Cost"><a href="#How-Much-Does-Xbox-Game-Pass-Cost" class="headerlink" title="How Much Does Xbox Game Pass Cost?"></a>How Much Does Xbox Game Pass Cost?</h2><p> Aside from variations in the available Xbox Game Pass games, the prices for each Game Pass tier also vary substantially. However, all Xbox Game Pass tiers bill monthly, and you can cancel whenever. The pricing for each tier of Xbox Game Pass, then, is as follows:</p><ul><li>Xbox Game Pass Core costs $9.99 per month.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass for Console costs $10.99 per month.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass for PC costs $9.99 per month.</li><li>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate costs $16.99 per month.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/xbox-wire_sku-chart_english_1920x1080_01-3d252e8eca2501f34d43.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image of all of the available Xbox Game Pass tiers and subscriptions"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/17/xbox-game-pass-core/" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While these prices are set,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-xbox-game-pass-will-get-more-expensive/" >Xbox Game Pass prices will likely increase over time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

For instance, regions like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan support all aspects of Xbox Game Pass.</p><p> And while countless other regions support all the features and tiers of Xbox Game Pass, there are some, like Russia or China, that don’t or come with unique restrictions.

But whereas most handheld gaming systems today play retro games, this is something else entirely.</p><p> Picture Valve’s Steam Deck, then imagine how it might be running Windows and twice the processing power. That’s what you get with the GPD Win 4, a system that doesn’t only play the latest AAA titles on Steam, Epic, and Xbox Game Pass, it also lets you run classic titles. If your chosen emulation platform runs on Windows, you can play those old games on the GPD Win 4.</p><p> In fact, apart from a few console titles, you can play most games ever released on this device.</p><h2 id="It’s-Like-a-Steam-Deck-With-a-Physical-Keyboard"><a href="#It’s-Like-a-Steam-Deck-With-a-Physical-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="It’s Like a Steam Deck With a Physical Keyboard"></a>It’s Like a Steam Deck With a Physical Keyboard</h2><p>One of the most stunning features of this device is the keyboard.</p><p> Hidden behind the display, the keyboard is there for a reason—but I’m not 100% certain what that reason is. The keys are too small for proper typing, after all, and in this day and age of multi-form factor devices and onscreen keyboards, it seems superfluous. Gamers tend towards headsets and voice chat for multiplayer, so the physical keyboard just doesn’t seem necessary for messaging.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-kb.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 with keyboard open"                ></p><p> When keys are required, connecting a keyboard seems smarter; an onscreen keyboard should be adequate in most cases.</p><p> That said, the action on the display’s sliding motion is nice. It feels like using a classic Windows Mobile phone, but this is arguably a direct lineage of “Pocket PC,” regardless of how many iterations and companies it took to get there.</p><h2 id="What-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-Ship-With"><a href="#What-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-Ship-With" class="headerlink" title="What Does the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld Ship With?"></a>What Does the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld Ship With?</h2><p> Cracking open the GPD Win 4 box reveals a modest collection of kit. Aside from the Sony PlayStation Portable-esque main device, there is a wrist strap, screen protector, and USB Type-C mains power adapter.</p><p> The cable detaches from the charger (it’s USB Type-C at both ends) which makes it pretty flexible for most scenarios. Sadly, there’s no case or even a small tote bag with this handheld. Accessories are available for the device, however, including a case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100533/7443" target="_top" id="2100533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-System-Specification"><a href="#GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld-System-Specification" class="headerlink" title="GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld System Specification"></a>GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld System Specification</h2><p> The specification for this handheld PC will surprise you. For context, it measures 220 x 92 x 28mm (8.66 x 3.62 x 1.1 inches), and weighs 598g (21.1oz). Inside its PSP-inspired chassis, you’ll find an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U with AMD Radeon 680M graphics, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD with Windows 11 pre-installed. The OS ensures all expected video, audio, and picture formats are playable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-left-power.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 power button"                ></p><p> It supports 802.11ax Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6&#x2F;6E) with 2.4 and 5GHz bands, and a dual channel maximum transmission rate of 2402Mbps. For audio and controllers, Bluetooth 5.2 is supported.</p><p> A single USB 4 Type-C port supporting a data rate of 40Gbps is featured, along with a 3.5mm audio port. That port is on the top of the console for connectivity; the power port is on the lower side of the device. A USB 3 Type-A port is also provided, along with a TF slot for removable microSD card storage. Power and volume buttons are also provided.</p><p> The Li-polymer battery requires the 65-watt USB Type-C charger, although substitutes (e.g. laptop, Steam Deck) will work.</p><p> While the listed hardware states the presence of an HDMI port, the model we reviewed does not have this. Instead, video out is via the USB Type C port on the top of the console.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-usbc.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 USB Type-C port"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1976998">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1976998">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1976998%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1976998/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The Corning Gorilla Glass 5 display is a 6-inch H-IPS with 1080p resolution, 368PPI, and refresh rate options of 40Hz and 60Hz.

You can watch videos, listen to music, and read eBooks.</p><p> Find a suitable hub, and you can leave it plugged into your HDMI display and set up as a home console.

This is suitable for everything from external storage to additional peripherals.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Comfort-of-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld"><a href="#Design-and-Comfort-of-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld" class="headerlink" title="Design and Comfort of the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld"></a>Design and Comfort of the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld</h2><p> Available in various colors, I received the white version of the GPD Win 4 for review. It features a matte finish, which aids grip, although the two rear buttons are difficult to reach. The console isn’t as wide as a Steam Deck, and not as comfortable to use.</p><p> The GPD Win 4 has two thumbsticks, XYBA, D-Pad, dual shoulder buttons, and dual triggers, both left and right. In addition, the device features a Start button, Select button, and clickable mouse trackpad. A swift press acts as the left-click; a longer press corresponds to a right-click. This last feature is a necessity for PC gaming, but this implementation is often unwieldy. It’s also mostly useless for arcade&#x2F;FPS gaming, although it does work with strategy titles where fast reactions are less important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-right-control.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 controller right"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> For any game that requires “controller mode” a useful switch is situated on the left side of the console. This enables the thumbsticks and buttons to work as they would if you had plugged an Xbox controller into a PC.</p><p> The GPD Win 4 also has supports rear-mounted expansions. At the time of writing, only a 4G LTE radio is available, which clips onto the back of the console. The mounting points can be seen in the molding of the chassis, which sports echoes of the Sony PSP handheld.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-left-trigger.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 left trigger"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> RGB LEDs cycle through a color change beneath the two clear shoulder buttons, changing how you might perceive the console. But when the color turns green, this white handheld feels like a portable Xbox 360.</p><h2 id="Testing-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld"><a href="#Testing-the-GPD-Win-4-Gaming-Handheld" class="headerlink" title="Testing the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld"></a>Testing the GPD Win 4 Gaming Handheld</h2><p> I selected four games (all on Steam) to measure this device. How did they work out?</p><ul><li>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order (2019): the popular third-person action RPG plays perfectly on this system, with little difference in graphics from the Xbox One version.</li><li>DOOM Eternal: (2020) this stonkingly good first-person shooter (FPS) plays fantastically well, and the handheld device doesn’t hurt the performance.</li><li>Beyond the Long Night (2023): a screen-by-screen retro-style adventure, this quirky pixel graphic adventure game plays perfectly well on the GPD Win 4, and boasts striking original audio.</li><li>Old World (2022): a Civilization-style isometric strategy game. In handheld mode this is almost unplayable. The screen is too small and while Steam offers a zoom feature, this is unwieldy on the GPD Win 4 (and isn’t much better on the Steam Deck either, despite the larger display, so no surprises here).</li></ul><p> I like the controls on the device, which all seem to be where you would need them (apart from the ones on the back). The menu buttons are a different matter (see below).</p><p> In terms of audio, the onboard speakers are a bit on the tinny size, but it sounds fine over a wired or Bluetooth headset.</p><h2 id="How-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Compare-to-a-Steam-Deck"><a href="#How-Does-the-GPD-Win-4-Compare-to-a-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="How Does the GPD Win 4 Compare to a Steam Deck?"></a>How Does the GPD Win 4 Compare to a Steam Deck?</h2><p> I’ve been using the Steam Deck since 2022, during which time it has become my main console. The reason for this is its pure flexibility, enabling me to game in any room in the house, or beyond if the mood takes me.</p><p> On paper, the GPD Win 4 offers the same flexibility, with roughly the same battery life. While in practice, this is mostly true, it has three key differences.</p><p> First, the GPD Win 4 is undeniably more powerful than the Steam Deck. Second, it runs Windows 11, an OS that while widely used, I dislike intensely. While running Steam in Big Picture mode can fool you into thinking you’re using a Steam Deck, it’s a short-lived illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-review-gpd-win-4-compare.jpg"                      alt="GPD Win 4 vs Steam Deck"                ></p><p> Third, and perhaps most important, is that the GPD Win 4 doesn’t feel as comfortable as the Steam Deck. In fact, I’d go as far as to say it’s akin to playing games on a house brick.</p><p> Those rear buttons are a pain to reach, the Select and Start buttons are too small, and the mouse-to-controller toggle is easy to catch. That can cause some problems mid-game, let me tell you.</p><h2 id="The-GPD-Win-4-Lets-You-Play-Anywhere-for-a-Price"><a href="#The-GPD-Win-4-Lets-You-Play-Anywhere-for-a-Price" class="headerlink" title="The GPD Win 4 Lets You Play Anywhere, for a Price"></a>The GPD Win 4 Lets You Play Anywhere, for a Price</h2><p> At the most basic level, this handheld PC lets you play recent AAA titles on the go. That in itself is amazing, and with the controller layout, you get to enjoy seamless console-style gaming.</p><p> With the Windows 11 operating system, you benefit from compatibility with almost every PC games platform, plus PC Game Pass. The GPD Win 4’s fast Wi-Fi, meanwhile, delivers reliable performance on any number of game streaming services.</p><p> Heavy, bulky, and rough, it will play almost any game you throw at it, but the GPD Win 4 just isn’t that comfortable to use. After an hour of play, my hands were cramping, and I yearned for my Steam Deck.</p><p> While I could easily hook up an Xbox One-style controller, that illustrates the point: those controllers are ergonomic, and easy to hold. They make you happy to keep playing. Similarly, the larger Steam Deck is easy on the hands compared with this device.</p><p> Hardware-wise, the GPD Win 4 is a Steam Deck killer, and battery life aside, delivers portable PC and console-level gaming. Comfort-wise, however, it only delivers hand cramps.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-microscopic-views-in-teams/"><u>[New] Mastering the Microscopic Views in Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-exquisite-background-melodies-for-edits/"><u>[Updated] Exquisite Background Melodies for Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-pros-and-cons-ranking-the-best-7-aqua-cameras-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pros & Cons Ranking the Best 7 Aqua Cameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-visual-editors-journey-cropping-content-for-instagram-standout/"><u>2024 Approved The Visual Editor's Journey Cropping Content for Instagram Standout</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/7-advantages-of-ignoring-ray-tracing-in-gaming/"><u>7 Advantages of Ignoring Ray Tracing in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/7-ways-to-save-money-with-your-xbox-series-xs/"><u>7 Ways to Save Money With Your Xbox Series X|S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/achieve-discord-mastery-mac-installation-tips/"><u>Achieve Discord Mastery: Mac Installation Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/adapting-to-progress-deciphering-steams-latest-ai-regulations-for-gamers/"><u>Adapting to Progress: Deciphering Steam's Latest AI Regulations for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/addressing-leaning-graphics-panel-issue-gpu-sag/"><u>Addressing Leaning Graphics Panel Issue (GPU Sag)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/avoiding-scams-on-the-quest-for-starfield-access/"><u>Avoiding Scams on the Quest for Starfield Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-simulate-gps-movement-with-location-spoofer-on-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Simulate GPS Movement With Location Spoofer On Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-the-secrets-to-making-spectacular-haul-videos/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling the Secrets to Making Spectacular Haul Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719168271225-revolutionize-your-computer-experience-upgrade-to-the-latest-nvidia-driver/"><u>Revolutionize Your Computer Experience – Upgrade to the Latest Nvidia Driver</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/securing-memories-a-comprehensive-guide-for-scanning-and-storing-vintage-photos-for-2024/"><u>Securing Memories A Comprehensive Guide for Scanning and Storing Vintage Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-magic-behind-shooting-images-with-iphones-hdr-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling the Magic Behind Shooting Images with iPhone’s HDR for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Even if you look up lists of free games on Steam online, there’s a chance they won’t be up-to-date and miss some of the newer releases. Fortunately, you can take matters into your own hands with these handy ways I use to find great free games.</p><h2 id="1-Finding-the-Best-Free-Steam-Games-With-Steam-Search"><a href="#1-Finding-the-Best-Free-Steam-Games-With-Steam-Search" class="headerlink" title="1 Finding the Best Free Steam Games With Steam Search"></a>1 Finding the Best Free Steam Games With Steam Search</h2><p> There are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/all-gamers-should-use-steam-reasons-why/" >reasons to use Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but one thing I really like about it is how easy it is to find well-rated free games. To do this, go to the Steam store front page (it doesn’t matter if it’s in the client or on the website). Then, click the<strong>magnifying glass</strong> icon to the right of the search box to bring up the search tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-magnifying.png"                      alt="Clicking the magnifying glass on Steam"                ></p><p> Look at the filters on the right side of the results. At the very top, you should see<strong>Narrow by price</strong> . Drag the slider all the way to the left so that the filter reads<strong>Free</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-slider.png"                      alt="Adjusting the price slider on Steam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now you have every free product on Steam at your fingertips. This will include products you likely won’t have any use for, such as free DLC for games you don’t own. To fix that, go down to the<strong>Show selected types</strong> filter and check<strong>Games</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-types.png"                      alt="Selecting the Games filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100533/7443" target="_top" id="2100533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you want, you can also take the time to go through the filters and refine what games you see. For example, you can select relevant tags, how many players the game supports, or whether or not it has been verified for the Steam Deck. If you’re taking the latter route, remember that you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-pc-mouse-and-keyboard-with-steam-deck-using-barrier/" >share your mouse and keyboard with your Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you think it’ll help with a particular genre.</p><p> Finally, we want to see what the best games are. To do this, click on the drop-down box next to<strong>Sort by</strong> and click<strong>User reviews</strong> . Now, Steam will sort all of the games based on the ratio of positive to negative ratio the games have—the more positive reviews, the better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-sort.png"                      alt="Sorting Steam games by review"                ></p><h2 id="2-Checking-Trending-Games-on-Steam"><a href="#2-Checking-Trending-Games-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="2 Checking Trending Games on Steam"></a>2 Checking Trending Games on Steam</h2><p> The above search trick is great for finding the best free games—but after a while, the search gets a little stale. The same few games stay at the top of the rankings, and if you play them all, you’re pretty much stuck until another blockbuster game comes out.</p><p> Fortunately, there is a way to find good, free games that have just been released. Head back to the Steam storefront, then hover over the<strong>New and Noteworthy</strong> category at the top and select<strong>New Releases</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-new.jpg"                      alt="Selecting the new Steam games"                ></p><p> Scroll down until you see the list of games, then click on<strong>Popular New Releases</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-popular.png"                      alt="Filtering the new games by popular titles"                ></p><p> Like above, set the slider to<strong>Free</strong> and check the<strong>Games</strong> filter. By going through the popular new releases, Steam will now serve up games that are both seeing a lot of user activity and are rated well. You can see this in the review column: all of the games will have at least a “mostly positive” rating.</p><p> If you applied the same filters to the regular new releases list, you’d see free games that are either unrated or rated poorly, so this method is best to find games that are worth playing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Using-Third-Party-Websites-to-Find-Free-Games"><a href="#3-Using-Third-Party-Websites-to-Find-Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="3 Using Third-Party Websites to Find Free Games"></a>3 Using Third-Party Websites to Find Free Games</h2><p> Things get a little trickier if you want to find games with free special offers or giveaways. If you want to go this route, you’ll need to take advantage of some third-party websites.</p><p> Reddit has a few subreddits dedicated to finding free games, including titles that are having a free promotion period. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/" >FreeGameFinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGamesOnSteam/" >FreeGamesOnSteam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subreddits are good places to check out; the latter is particularly good at weeding out games that are only free for a weekend, or during a beta test.</p><p> You can also check out<a class="link"   href="https://steamdb.info/upcoming/free/" >SteamDB’s free promotions filter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more titles.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Rediscover-the-Golden-Age-Top-30-PS3-Games-on-PC-with-Superior-Emulators"><a href="#Rediscover-the-Golden-Age-Top-30-PS3-Games-on-PC-with-Superior-Emulators" class="headerlink" title="Rediscover the Golden Age: Top 30 PS3 Games on PC with Superior Emulators"></a>Rediscover the Golden Age: Top 30 PS3 Games on PC with Superior Emulators</h2><p> PC emulation can be the most customizable and nostalgic form of gaming. But with so much of modern emulation being inaccessible or locked behind nefarious sites, it can be a bit of a mind field. This is especially true of PlayStation 3 emulation.</p><p> However, with the correct emulators, you can turn your PC into a great PlayStation 3 emulator. Just remember that you will need to use ROMs of games you own: downloading ROMs of unowned games online is illegal. But with that said, let’s look at some of the best and safest PlayStation 3 emulators for your PC.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-RPCS3"><a href="#1-RPCS3" class="headerlink" title="1. RPCS3"></a>1. RPCS3</h2><p> Probably the most reliable PlayStation 3 emulator, RPCS3 allows you to play .ISO PlayStation 3 ROMs as seamlessly as any other mainstream emulators, and with all the features you may expect of emulation.</p><p> To name just a few features, RPCS3 comes with supported controller mapping and allows you to use any controller your PC supports to play PlayStation 3 games, altered shaders, and graphics options for your games. RPCS3 even allows you to play some supported PlayStation 3 titles at 4K and 60FPS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3032.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the dashboard of the RPCS3 emulator running on a PC"                ></p><p> However, RPCS3 does struggle to play some PlayStation 3 games and comes with a compatibility list, as provided via<a class="link"   href="https://rpcs3.net/compatibility" >the official RPCS3 site <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you choose to use RPCS3 as your emulator, you may want to check the status of the ROM you want to play on this list to ensure it’s compatible with your PC.</p><p> Similarly, RPCS3 also has some light system requirements you must check before installing the emulator. Luckily, via the<a class="link"   href="https://rpcs3.net/quickstart" >RPCS3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website, there is a clear requirements list you can check against your own PC’s stats before installing the emulator.</p><p> And despite some shortcomings, RPCS3 represents one of the most reliable and streamlined PlayStation 3 emulators. So, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-ps3-still-offers-great-gaming-experience/" >find out why PlayStation 3 games still offer a great gaming experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> via emulation, RPCS3 should satisfy your needs.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> RPCS3 via<a class="link"   href="https://rpcs3.net/download" >the official RPCS3 download page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-RetroArch"><a href="#2-RetroArch" class="headerlink" title="2. RetroArch"></a>2. RetroArch</h2><p> A different kind of emulation experience that offers a similarly reliable experience as RPCS3 is the front-end collection of emulators called RetroArch.</p><p> While RetroArch isn’t designed for PlayStation 3 emulation, the software contains valid ways of emulating PlayStation 3 games. RetroArch even features an emulation core, or emulation software, for RSPC3.</p><p> The caveat with RetroArch is that the software is constantly changing, and you must use the<strong>Online Updater</strong> tool to ensure you have access to all the available emulators. PlayStation 3 emulation is one such emulator that relies on the<strong>Online Updater</strong> tool to function.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3042.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of RetroArch running on a PC with the Online Updater option highlighted"                ></p><p> If you want to utilize RetroArch as a PlayStation 3 emulator, you need to ensure you have selected<strong>Update Core Info Files</strong> under<strong>Online Updater</strong> . Once the cores are updated, you can access emulators like RPCS3 for your software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3045.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the options for the Online Updater available within RetroArch on PC"                ></p><p> But with emulator cores up and running on RetroArch, you can access reliable PlayStation 3 emulation and the unique features provided by RetroArch. You can even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/add-achievements-retro-games-with-retroarch/" >add achievements to your emulated games using RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , for instance.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> RetroArch for PC from<a class="link"   href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms" >the official RetroArch download page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094429/7443" target="_top" id="2094429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094429/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Nucleus"><a href="#3-Nucleus" class="headerlink" title="3. Nucleus"></a>3. Nucleus</h2><p> In contrast to emulators and software like RPCS3 and RetroArch, a more bare-bones way of emulating PlayStation 3 games on PC is by utilizing Nucleus.</p><p> Nucleus is a PlayStation 3 emulator aimed at low-level emulation. While this may sound disappointing, because of how Nucleus runs PlayStation 3 ROMs, it provides a consistent and reliable emulation experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nikita-kostrykin-i1q9pphrwuw-unsplash.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of a PlayStation 3 controller and console"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111995/7443" target="_top" id="2111995">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111995" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111995/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> By forcing you to run PlayStation 3 games directly through the Nucleus executable, Nucleus guarantees that the ROMs of your purchased games will run within the emulator. But the main issues with Nucleus stem from how the ROMs run and what you need to do to ensure they can be played.</p><p> Nucleus requires you to copy and add the official PlayStation 3 decryption files (in the form of keys.xml) to the emulator itself, which isn’t exactly user-friendly. But on the flip side, doing so via your officially purchased console and games guarantees you are legally emulating Playstation 3 games.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-3048.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the main menu and notification screen of the Nucleus emulator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Unfortunately, unlike RetroArch and RPCS3, development of Nucleus has been halted for some time and while the emulator works and is safe, it isn’t as effective as some of the other great PlayStation 3 emulators available.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Nucleus via<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/AlexAltea/nucleus/releases" >GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-PlayStation-Plus"><a href="#4-PlayStation-Plus" class="headerlink" title="4. PlayStation Plus"></a>4. PlayStation Plus</h2><p> Surprisingly, another way you can emulate PlayStation 3 games on your PC reliably is through PlayStation’s official subscription service: PlayStation Plus. And while the method of playing PlayStation 3 games on your PC via PlayStation Plus is unconventional, it is a safe and reliable way of doing so.</p><p> With PlayStation Plus providing Sony’s answer to Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation allows you to stream PlayStation titles to any device that supports PlayStation Plus. This includes selected PlayStation 3 titles. You can see the full catalog of PlayStation Plus titles via the official listings provided by<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/games/" >PlayStation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/playstation-plus.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the available PlayStation Plus tiers taken from the official PlayStation site"                ></p><p> Because you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-and-use-ps-now-on-your-pc/" >access PlayStation Plus on your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can stream PlayStation titles to your PC as well. Therefore, by utilizing PlayStation Plus you can stream and emulate PlayStation 3 games directly to your PC.</p><p> However, a glance at the supported PlayStation 3 titles, like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, will show you that all the PlayStation 3 titles are listed as part of the Classics Catalog and are exclusive to Platinum tier subscribers.</p><p> Unfortunately, if you want to use PlayStation Plus as an official way to emulate and stream PlayStation 3 games to your PC, you will have to pay the highest monthly fee of $17.99. But at least with PlayStation officially supporting the feature, you don’t have to worry about any legality issues associated with other emulators.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> PlayStation Plus for PC using the official download link via<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/ps-plus-pc/#app" >PlayStation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Enjoy-and-Elevate-PlayStation-3-Games-With-PC-Emulation"><a href="#Enjoy-and-Elevate-PlayStation-3-Games-With-PC-Emulation" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy and Elevate PlayStation 3 Games With PC Emulation"></a>Enjoy and Elevate PlayStation 3 Games With PC Emulation</h2><p> While there are a lot of ineffective and potentially dangerous PlayStation 3 emulators out there, by sticking with the most reliable and safe emulators, like RetroArch and RPCS3, you guarantee your enjoyment of PS3 titles on PC.</p><p> And even with PlayStation Plus providing an albeit expensive official alternative, you can guarantee safe and effective emulation.

The worst offender is when games encourage you to spend more money, even after you’ve paid retail prices. This form of monetization is labeled as being pay-to-win if the game pushes you to buy unfair advantages over other players.</p><p> However, while lots of live service games are pay-to-win, some manage to avoid predatory monetization and end up being great all-around experiences. So, if you want to experience one of the most common gaming trends, here are the best examples that won’t force you to pay extra.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Fortnite"><a href="#1-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="1.

And surprisingly, if you want to avoid pay-to-win practices in live service games, Fortnite is also an apt example.</p><p> Many aspects define<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/live-service-games-what-how-work/" >how live service games work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and often games that switch to live service will also become free-to-play, just like Halo Infinite Multiplayer. However, with this switch to free-to-play gaming, you will often find a trade-off in which the game will feature more monetization.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d83a12dd-db8b-4005-b944-e799c4792980.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of a Fortnite Victory Royale on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But Fortnite provides a free-to-play live service experience that never forces you to purchase microtransactions. All the microtransactions in Fortnite are entirely cosmetic, and even if you buy level skips, all unlockables remain cosmetic.</p><p> The result is an experience where you can spend money on some of Fortnite’s endless themed events, like Transformers-themed skins, but are never forced to do so. Bundle this with how Fortnite constantly evolves to provide a fresh experience, and live service gaming’s most popular title turns out to be one of its best.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Fortnite on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/fortnite/" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/fortnite/bt5p2x999vh2" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fortnite-switch/" >Nintendo Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or<a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fortnite" >Epic Games Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Sea-of-Thieves"><a href="#2-Sea-of-Thieves" class="headerlink" title="2. Sea of Thieves"></a>2. Sea of Thieves</h2><p> Aside from battle royale live service games like Fortnite, the Xbox-exclusive title Sea of Thieves provides a unique game focused on swash-buckling piracy, exploration, and ship-to-ship combat. More importantly, the in-game activities for Sea of Thieves allow for enough rewards to keep you from spending extra money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sea-of-thieves-loading.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Sea of Thieves on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> The gameplay loop in Sea of Thieves and its reward system is much like many other live service titles or MMOs. Throughout the game, you can complete specific bounties for Guilds, progressing toward your next Guild level and earning Gold. The higher your Guild level, the more rewards you can unlock or purchase.</p><p> Generally, because of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-pay-to-win-in-video-games/" >how pay-to-win games work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , aspects of your game are restricted to encourage you to spend money to compensate. For instance, the Guild system can become highly tedious if progression moves at a snail’s pace or rewards are locked behind a paywall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sea-of-thieves-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of gameplay from Sea of Thieves on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But in Sea of Thieves, you may never feel the need to spend money as the quest rewards in terms of XP and currency, whether through finding a Treasure Chest or fighting a Skeleton Ship, are enough to purchase the unlocks you receive throughout the game.</p><p> And yes, while you can spend money on cosmetic store items to deck out your ship in whatever ridiculous theme may be available at the time, the unlocks from Guilds and free events all feel worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sea-of-thieves-2023-edition/9P2N57MC619K/0010" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea%5Fof%5FThieves%5F2023%5FEdition/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-League-of-Legends"><a href="#3-League-of-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. League of Legends"></a>3. League of Legends</h2><p> Many online battle arena games focus on providing a free-to-play live service experience for you to sink countless hours into. But when it comes to PC gaming, League of Legends represents one of the best anti-pay-to-win titles you can play.</p><p> Like other games of its genre, League of Legends focuses on a roster of fantastical Champions and pits you against numerous online opponents in arena-based combat. This involves fine-tuning your Champion’s build, items, and abilities throughout every match.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/league-of-legends-promotional-image.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for League of Legends"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" >League of Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> And in a game that relies so heavily on optimizing builds, any pay-to-win aspects would potentially break the entire gameplay loop of League of Legends. And luckily, the developers are on the same page, with Riot promising to only ever feature cosmetic microtransactions.</p><p> However, unlocking Champions, while available through free-to-earn currency, can be slow, and you are given the option to purchase a Champion through paid currency. But even in this case, League of Legends provides you with 15 free Champions to play on rotation every week.</p><p> So while you may feel the urge to buy a Champion with paid money, you can always experience other free League of Legends Champions, and earn currency towards a Champion you are tempted to buy along the way.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : League of Legends via the official<a class="link"   href="https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/index" >League of Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> site.</p><h2 id="4-Rocket-League"><a href="#4-Rocket-League" class="headerlink" title="4. Rocket League"></a>4. Rocket League</h2><p> Sometimes, pay-to-win mechanics can appear in more mysterious ways, presenting you with unfair advantages and disadvantages where you least expect them. These mechanics can extend to the damage you deal, your ability cooldowns, or even in-game hitboxes.</p><p> For Rocket League, the free-to-play live service soccer game with cars, having a more advantageous hitbox to connect with the ball would be a massive bias. Luckily, not only is the game free-to-play, but it also features no way you can pay for advantages over other players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rocket-league-octane-body.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of Rocket League on Xbox Series X showcasing the car customization options"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043855/7443" target="_top" id="2043855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And while there are different hitboxes for different cars, the default cars available at the start of the game represent some of the best hitboxes anyway. If you use the Octane body, you already have the best hitbox, and it’s completely free.</p><p> Combined with the unique merging of soccer and Hot Wheels-like racing, Rocket League becomes an addictive game that you and your friends can dive into without the fear of intrusive pay-to-win practices.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Rocket League on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rocket-league/C125W9BG2K0V/0001" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2002-CUSA01163%5F00-ROCKETLEAGUENA01" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/rocket-league-switch/" >Nintendo Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or the<a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rocket-league" >Epic Games Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Smite"><a href="#5-Smite" class="headerlink" title="5. Smite"></a>5. Smite</h2><p> Another key factor of live service games, especially if you go to play a free-to-play live service game, is Battle Passes. And games that feature a Battle Pass come with an extra layer to how pay-to-win practices can be implemented.</p><p> For instance, if you play a live service title with a premium paid Battle Pass that keeps exclusive features like weapons or stat boosts locked behind a pay wall, the game is likely pay-to-win.</p><p> But while there are many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-battle-pass-can-alter-gaming-experience/" >ways Battle Passes can alter your gaming experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , if you want to experience a free-to-play live service title that represents a well-implemented Battle Pass with no pay-to-win features, Smite is the game for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/smite-loading.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Smite on Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948954/19272" target="_top" id="1948954">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948954" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948954/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Smite is a free-to-play online battle arena game like League of Legends that takes a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective instead of top-down.</p><p> Uniquely, Smite enables you to play and fight against Gods from almost every pantheon without fear of being forced to spend money. So if you want to dive into a battleground of Gods, free from the worries of having to spend extra money to catch up with Zeus or Anubis, you’ll be more than happy to sink your time into Smite.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Smite on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/smite/c2mhs238pdns" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0334-CUSA02328%5F00-SMITEXXXXXXXXXXX" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/smite-switch/" >Nintendo Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/SMITE/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or the<a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/smite" >Epic Games Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="6-Path-of-Exile"><a href="#6-Path-of-Exile" class="headerlink" title="6. Path of Exile"></a>6. Path of Exile</h2><p> Aside from massive arena multiplayer games, or online PvP titles, if you’re looking for a free-to-play live service single-player experience, the Diablo-like action-RPG game Path of Exile can scratch your gaming itch.</p><p> On the surface, Path of Exile appears as one of the many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-action-rpg-games-to-play-instead-of-diablo/" >action-RPG games you can play instead of Diablo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But once you dive deeper into the game, you’ll realize that the level of gameplay, gear, and character optimization provided far outstretches Diablo IV.</p><p> With an immensely vast paragon tree and a unique feature in which the combination of gems placed in your armor influences your skills and allows for skill customization, Path of Exile stands on its own as a rival, not an alternative, to Diablo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/path-of-exile-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of gameplay for Path of Exile on Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And even with the main story completed, you can still expect to sink countless hours into the post-game activities, just as you would Diablo. Better yet, while the game features a paid Battle Pass, none of the unlockables affect gameplay and are all cosmetic.</p><p> This makes Path of Exile a must-play for any action-RPG fans, and a breath of fresh air if you’re looking for a live service title jam-packed full of content and free from any pay-to-win intrusions.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Path of Exile on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4781-CUSA11924%5F00-GGGPS4GAMEFULL01" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path%5Fof%5FExile/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Live-Service-Games-Can-Be-Free-From-Predatory-Microtransactions"><a href="#Live-Service-Games-Can-Be-Free-From-Predatory-Microtransactions" class="headerlink" title="Live Service Games Can Be Free From Predatory Microtransactions"></a>Live Service Games Can Be Free From Predatory Microtransactions</h2><p> While tons of live service games feature intrusive microtransactions and, yes, pay-to-win practices, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to find fair and fun live service titles among the rabble.</p><p> And if you’re willing to push through the barrage of live service announcements and games, you can find free-to-play titles like Fortnite and Path of Exile that represent hundreds of hours of gameplay.

For example, ROG consistently integrates the latest, cutting-edge CPU and GPU options as soon as they are released. ROG laptops were some of the first to utilize Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs, giving ROG an edge in performance and future-proofing over TUF, which often uses prior generation or more mainstream components to hit lower price points.</p><p> The story is similar for displays. ROG gaming laptops push the boundaries with features like 300Hz+ refresh rates, 1440p or 4K resolutions, and mini-LED backlighting for enhanced contrast. TUF screens still offer solid gaming performance with refresh rates around 144Hz and 1080p resolution but stop short of the bleeding-edge technology ROG debuts.</p><p> For some, TUF represents a sweet spot that balances capability and cost. But for buyers wanting an uncompromising top-tier experience, ROG’s cutting-edge parts and screens deliver system performance a notch above the rest.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ProArt-Creativity-Unleashed"><a href="#ProArt-Creativity-Unleashed" class="headerlink" title="ProArt: Creativity Unleashed"></a>ProArt: Creativity Unleashed</h2><p> The ProArt series is for content creators and professionals who demand precision and unparalleled performance.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Subscriber’s-Guide-PS-or-XbG"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Subscriber’s-Guide-PS-or-XbG" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Subscriber’s Guide: PS+ or XbG+?"></a>The Ultimate Subscriber’s Guide: PS+ or XbG+?</h2><p> All-you-can-stream services like Netflix and Spotify have largely replaced owning media in the movie and music spheres, and video games are slowly moving towards this new standard as well. Both Sony and Microsoft offer their own game subscription services in the form of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass, respectively.</p><p> Let’s compare PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass to see which offers the better value for money. Given how prevalent these services are, they could be the determining factor in which console you decide to buy.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Basics-of-PlayStation-Plus"><a href="#The-Basics-of-PlayStation-Plus" class="headerlink" title="The Basics of PlayStation Plus"></a>The Basics of PlayStation Plus</h2><p> Sony’s game subscription offering has gone through some changes. PlayStation Now, which launched in early 2015, was the first form. This was a standalone subscription that allowed you to stream hundreds of titles on modern consoles from across PlayStation’s history, with many newer games available to download as well.</p><p> In June 2022, PlayStation Plus expanded to offer three tiers: Essential, Extra, and Premium. Essential is the same as the original PS Plus plan.</p><p> PS Plus Extra adds access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games through the Game Catalog. Ubisoft+ Classics is also included, letting you play some of Ubisoft’s top titles at no extra cost. These are all downloadable.</p><p> PS Plus Premium includes everything from the lower tiers, plus the game streaming that was part of PlayStation Now (that service is now retired). Sony calls this the Classics Catalog, which features titles from the PS3 and earlier. Most of these are available to download, though you’ll need to stream the PS3 games since the newer PlayStation consoles aren’t compatible with the PS3’s architecture. Premium also allows you to stream some other Catalog games if you’d rather not download them.</p><p> See our<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-plus-essential-vs-extra-vs-premium/" >guide to PlayStation Plus’s tiers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more info.</p><p> In some regions where game streaming is not available, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, and South Africa, the highest tier is instead called PlayStation Plus Deluxe. This has all the same benefits as Premium, aside from streaming.</p><p> All tiers of PlayStation Plus are available for those on PS4 or PS5. If you opt for PS Plus Premium, you can also stream compatible games to your PC.</p><p> To stream, you’ll need an internet connection that can handle this—Sony recommends at least 5Mbps. Streaming will often give worse performance compared to downloading games; be prepared for a lower resolution and&#x2F;or frame rate, input lag, and fewer audio options.</p><h3 id="Downloading-With-PlayStation-Plus"><a href="#Downloading-With-PlayStation-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Downloading With PlayStation Plus"></a>Downloading With PlayStation Plus</h3><p> As mentioned above, most games included with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium are available to download. This lets you enjoy games just like if you’d bought them normally. You can earn trophies, and online multiplayer is available.</p><p> When you download a game, it will output at full resolution. You can purchase DLC for the game, use any included PS VR modes, and access similar extra features.</p><p> You can download as many games as you have space for, but your system will check in with PSN every seven days to make sure your subscription is still valid. If you go too long without connecting, you can’t use your downloaded games until you’re back online.</p><h3 id="PlayStation-Plus-Premium-on-PC"><a href="#PlayStation-Plus-Premium-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Plus Premium on PC"></a>PlayStation Plus Premium on PC</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-and-use-ps-now-on-your-pc/" >PlayStation Plus Premium also works on Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , regardless of whether you have a PlayStation console. If you play on both PC and console, you can access your saved data on both thanks to cloud storage.</p><p> You’ll need a PSN account and the free PS Plus PC app to get started; you can download this on<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/ps-plus-pc/" >Sony’s PlayStation Plus PC page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Have a look at the bottom of this page for details on system requirements. If you play other games on your PC, you should have no problem meeting these.</p><p> While Sony advises that PC play requires a DualShock 4 controller, people have reported that<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-pc-controllers/" >other PC-compatible gamepads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like the Xbox controller will work too. However, you won’t be able to use DS4-specific functions, such as the touchpad or motion controls.</p><p> Keep in mind that you can’t download PS Plus games on your PC. PS Plus Premium also does not currently support streaming PS5 titles, though Sony has done beta tests of this function.</p><h2 id="Xbox-Game-Pass-Fundamentals"><a href="#Xbox-Game-Pass-Fundamentals" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Game Pass Fundamentals"></a>Xbox Game Pass Fundamentals</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/" >Xbox Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is available for Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S. On Windows 10 and 11 PCs, it’s called PC Game Pass.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-xbox-game-pass-everything-need-know/" >Game Pass for Xbox is pretty straightforward <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , especially compared to the somewhat confusing tiers of PlayStation Plus. It offers titles from every generation of Xbox. You can download as many titles as you want, as long as your system has enough room; consider<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-x-s-storage/" >adding storage to your Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you need more space.</p><p> In addition to downloading games, you can stream many Xbox Game Pass titles to enjoy them without installing files and taking up space on your console.</p><p> Your console must check in with Xbox Live every 30 days to make sure that your Game Pass subscription is still valid. Games regularly join and leave Game Pass, but as a subscriber, you get a discount if you choose to buy a game in the catalog (or its DLC) to keep.</p><p> Notably, in September 2023, Microsoft retired the long-running Xbox Live Gold name and replaced it with Game Pass Core. This baseline tier of the service lets you play paid multiplayer games online, and grants you access to a small library of games that’s much smaller than the main Game Pass list.</p><p> See our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/xbox-live-versus-playstation-plus-get/" >comparison of PS Plus Essential and Game Pass Core <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a full breakdown of the base plans; we’ll focus on the higher tiers below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934258/19272" target="_top" id="1934258">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934258" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934258/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Xbox-Game-Pass-for-PC"><a href="#Xbox-Game-Pass-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Game Pass for PC"></a>Xbox Game Pass for PC</h3><p> When you sign up for Game Pass, you’ll need to choose whether you want to subscribe to the console or PC service—or both. Unlike PS Plus, you don’t necessarily get full access to the service on both platforms with one subscription. The more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is required to access the library on both console and PC. (Ultimate also grants you access to online multiplayer on console.)</p><p> The catalog of games differs depending on the platform. Some games are available on both Xbox and PC, while others only support one platform or the other. Otherwise, PC Game Pass works just like Xbox Game Pass—unlimited access to download as much as you can fit on your computer, with streaming supported as well.</p><p> You’ll need to download the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/apps/xbox-app-for-pc" >Xbox app for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take advantage of Game Pass on PC. Unlike PS Plus, you don’t need a controller to play these games. The PC versions are built for PC, not streamed, so they control with a mouse and keyboard. This may not be the optimal method for all games, such as platformers, so many games also offer full controller support.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Xbox-Cloud-Gaming"><a href="#Xbox-Cloud-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Xbox Cloud Gaming"></a>Xbox Cloud Gaming</h3><p> If you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you also have the option to stream much of the Game Pass catalog. This works on iPhone and iPad, Android, PC, and Xbox consoles, allowing you to choose how you want to play.</p><p> See our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-xbox-cloud-gaming-how-does-it-work/" >Xbox Cloud Gaming intro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for details on what devices are compatible and how it works. In most cases, you’ll need a controller for best results, though some games support touch controls. You’ll also need a strong network connection—Microsoft recommends a 5Ghz Wi-Fi or mobile data connection that’s at least 10Mbps down.</p><h2 id="PlayStation-Plus-vs-Xbox-Game-Pass-Pricing"><a href="#PlayStation-Plus-vs-Xbox-Game-Pass-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Plus vs. Xbox Game Pass: Pricing"></a>PlayStation Plus vs. Xbox Game Pass: Pricing</h2><p> PlayStation Plus’s three tiers each come at a different cost, with the option to pay for one, three, or 12 months at a time. Note that Sony greatly increased the price of each tier in mid-2023:</p><ul><li><strong>PlayStation Plus Essential:</strong> $9.99&#x2F;month, $24.99&#x2F;quarter, or $79.99 per year</li><li><strong>PlayStation Plus Extra:</strong> $14.99&#x2F;month, $39.99&#x2F;quarter, or $134.99 per year</li><li><strong>PlayStation Plus Premium:</strong> $17.99&#x2F;month, $49.99&#x2F;quarter, or $159.99 per year</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ps-plus-pricing-2023.jpg"                      alt="PS Plus Pricing 2023"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880976/19272" target="_top" id="1880976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880976/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For Xbox Game Pass, the pricing breaks down like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Game Pass Core:</strong> $9.99&#x2F;month or $59.99&#x2F;year</li><li><strong>Game Pass for Console:</strong> $10.99&#x2F;month</li><li><strong>PC Game Pass:</strong> $9.99&#x2F;month</li><li><strong>Game Pass Ultimate:</strong> $16.99</li></ul><p> As mentioned, Ultimate gives you full access to Game Pass on both PC and Xbox. It also includes console online multiplayer for paid games, which would otherwise require Game Pass Core.</p><p> You’ll also need Ultimate to stream games on any compatible platform.

Thankfully, both platforms offer a wide selection of games, with new ones coming all the time. However, games are removed from both on occasion.</p><p> Keep in mind that if a game disappears from the catalog on either service, you won’t be able to play it unless you buy it on disc or digitally. Your saved data and any DLC you bought for the game will stick around, but you can’t use them until you own the title.</p><h3 id="The-PS-Plus-Game-Catalog"><a href="#The-PS-Plus-Game-Catalog" class="headerlink" title="The PS Plus Game Catalog"></a>The PS Plus Game Catalog</h3><p> At the time of writing, the Game Catalog boasts over 500 games for Extra subscribers. The majority of these are PS4 titles, though an increasing number of PS5 games are included too.</p><p> Some games will stick around for the foreseeable future, while others are swapped out regularly. Keep an eye on the PlayStation Blog and PlayStation’s social media for the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/PS-Plus-Latest-Additions.jpg"                      alt="PS Plus Latest Additions"                ></p><p>A few of the top titles on offer at the time of writing include:</p><ul><li>Celeste</li><li>Dead by Daylight</li><li>Demon’s Souls (PS5)</li><li>Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition (PS5)</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (PS5)</li><li>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut</li><li>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</li><li>Rayman Legends</li><li>Returnal (PS5)</li><li>Spiritfarer</li><li>Tetris Effect</li><li>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection (PS5)</li></ul><p> If you opt for PS Plus Premium, you’ll also have access to the Classics Catalog. This contains an additional ~400 games from the PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP systems. The PS3 is the most heavily represented here.</p><p> See the<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/games/" >full list of PS Plus games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to browse everything on offer.</p><p> Though PS Plus offers more games than Xbox Game Pass, it’s missing a lot of killer titles. Notably, brand-new PS5 exclusives do not come to PS Plus on day one, so major releases like The Last of Us Part I remake still require a separate purchase, even for subscribers.</p><p> There’s definitely a lot to play here, but you have to dig through a lot of filler too. You’ll likely be disappointed if you’re looking for quick access to all of PlayStation’s greatest hits.</p><h3 id="The-Xbox-Game-Pass-Catalog"><a href="#The-Xbox-Game-Pass-Catalog" class="headerlink" title="The Xbox Game Pass Catalog"></a>The Xbox Game Pass Catalog</h3><p> As of this writing, Xbox Game Pass has over 470 titles available on console and more than 440 for PC (many are on both).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Xbox-Game-Pass-Games.png"                      alt="game pass game selection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528696/16446" target="_top" id="1528696">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528696" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528696/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Some highlight titles include:</p><ul><li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</li><li>Hitman: World of Assassination</li><li>Doom Eternal</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Minecraft</li><li>Sea of Thieves</li></ul><p> See the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" >full list of Xbox Game Pass titles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more.</p><p> You’ll notice that Xbox Game Pass has more recent high-profile games than PS Plus; this is because all Xbox Game Studios titles come to Game Pass on the day of their release. This is the case with, for instance, Grounded and Halo Infinite.</p><p> Microsoft’s string of acquisitions also benefits Game Pass greatly. Since Microsoft owns Bethesda, for example, series like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls are well-represented in Game Pass.</p><h2 id="PS-Plus-and-Xbox-Game-Pass-Play-On"><a href="#PS-Plus-and-Xbox-Game-Pass-Play-On" class="headerlink" title="PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass: Play On"></a>PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass: Play On</h2><p> We’ve looked at both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass. In the end, which service is better for you depends on the games you want to play. If you’re a PC gamer who wants to access PlayStation exclusives without buying a PS4 or PS5, then PS Plus makes the most sense. For someone who plays on both Xbox and PC, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is definitely the best option.</p><p> Overall, we’d say Xbox Game Pass has the edge thanks to its focus on quality over quantity. Getting high-profile releases on day one is a huge draw, and the service has more games that most people actually want to play. If you’re not sure, take a deep look through both libraries and see which one appeals to you more.</p><p> Game Pass Ultimate is more expensive than PS Plus Premium, even after the latter had a price increase. But if you’re sold on all-you-can-play services, Microsoft’s approach seems to be the future of gaming.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-azure-speech-to-text-your-ultimate-development-toolkit/"><u>[Updated] Azure Speech-to-Text Your Ultimate Development Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-microsofts-innovation-on-display-the-hololens-revolution/"><u>[Updated] Microsoft's Innovation on Display – The HoloLens Revolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/approved-unlocking-youtubes-subscriber-potential-in-30-days/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking YouTube's Subscriber Potential in 30 Days</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/beyond-basics-why-hdr-dominates-in-video-editing-workflows-for-2024/"><u>Beyond Basics Why HDR Dominates in Video Editing Workflows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-for-viewing-and-modifying-pages-files-using-pc-software/"><u>Complete Tutorial for Viewing & Modifying Pages Files Using PC Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/crafting-a-responsible-gaming-ambiance-with-ps5/"><u>Crafting a Responsible Gaming Ambiance with PS5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-easiest-guide-how-to-clone-poco-x5-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Easiest Guide How to Clone Poco X5 Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-vivo-y27s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & Vivo Y27s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mini-pc-vs-desktop-pc-what-should-you-buy/"><u>Mini PC Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Customer-Centric-Work-Culture-in-Today’s-Organizations-Insights-From-ZDNet"><a href="#Customer-Centric-Work-Culture-in-Today’s-Organizations-Insights-From-ZDNet" class="headerlink" title="Customer-Centric Work Culture in Today’s Organizations - Insights From ZDNet"></a>Customer-Centric Work Culture in Today’s Organizations - Insights From ZDNet</h2><p>In essence, business and government organisations exist to serve customers, and customers’ expectations are accelerating. They are seeking services that are tailored to their needs, less intrusive, and make a positive difference to their lives.</p><p>Great relationships and business build from great customer experience (CX). Customers give an organisation more than just a contribution to the bottom line; they provide valuable insights that can be used to improve products and services to strengthen their brand.</p><p>Such insights can be critical in a world where new competitors appear regularly. While customer experience analytics solutions are advancing at a staggering rate, sometimes nothing beats talking to a customer to really understand their needs.</p><p>So why is it that so much of the responsibility for engaging with customers often rests with the contact centre team alone?</p><p>Working with customers does require a specialised skill set and everyone probably does have a lot on their plate already. But that shouldn’t mean that other employees should never interact with a customer. Nor should it ever mean that customers are not provided timely service because the contact centre can’t meet demand.</p><p>There is a pathway to transform customer engagement, however. Over the past 18 months Optus has partnered with many organisations who sought to leverage cloud enabled CX solutions, as a response to the radically changing workplace conditions enabling many of us to work from anywhere on a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>If the organisation’s role is to benefit the customer – and the tools now exist to make online collaboration easier from any location – then what does that mean for the traditional contact centre?</p><h3 id="Welcome-to-Hybrid-Customer-Engagement-–-service-has-no-boundaries"><a href="#Welcome-to-Hybrid-Customer-Engagement-–-service-has-no-boundaries" class="headerlink" title="Welcome to Hybrid Customer Engagement – service has no boundaries"></a><strong>Welcome to Hybrid Customer Engagement – service has no boundaries</strong></h3><p>It’s time to say goodbye to the old idea of the contact centre as a physical place with a fixed organisational structure and welcome an approach where everyone can engage with customers from any location and in seamless collaboration with other parts of the organisation.</p><p>The emergence of cloud CX solutions was a gamechanger through the COVID pandemic when employees worked from home for their own safety and the safety of others. Cloud-based solutions meant employees could connect with the organisation’s CX platforms from home as easily as from their old workplace – all they needed was a laptop, phone - and a reliable internet connection.</p><p>The pandemic proved that the model works, but now organisations are seeing the advantages of having a more flexible service workforce that no longer needs traditional structures such as location and corporate workspaces. It also means that more employees can engage with customers to meet both volume demand and customers’ service expectations.</p><p>Of course, there is more to creating Hybrid Customer Engagement than just training people to use location independent technology. Optus recognise that successful customer engagement organisations design for high performing and diverse teams that really care about service and relationships. Such high-performance service organisations are supported by intelligent real-time data that enables rapid adaptability and customisation to drive desired CX outcomes.</p><p>This means that lines of communication and workflow need to be re-designed to allow unprecedented levels of internal collaboration to deliver exceptional customer experience. This is possible if company leaders and have a clear set of CX guiding principles underpinned by an innovative cloud based CX solution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111982/7443" target="_top" id="2111982">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111982" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111982/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-new-ways-of-working-Enterprise-Customer-Engagement"><a href="#The-new-ways-of-working-Enterprise-Customer-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="The new ways of working - Enterprise Customer Engagement"></a><strong>The new ways of working - Enterprise Customer Engagement</strong></h3><p>This concept is brought to life by the latest release of Webex® Contact Center, a Cisco® solution built for the future of customer experience.

They Don’t Perform Much Better Than the 13th-Gen Intel Chips</h2><p> Of course, no matter what a processor maker says, the best way to gauge a chip’s performance is to see its real-world results. So, this is how the 14th-Generation Intel processors performed over 13th-Gen Intel chips and from competing AMD offerings.</p><p> First, let’s look at Gamer Nexus’s test of the Intel Core i9-14900K, linked above. Gamer Nexus used a computer with the following specifications for the test: RTX 4090 Strix GPU and DDR5-6000 Corsair RAM.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Intel Core i9-14900K</strong></th><th><strong>Intel Core i9-13900K</strong></th><th><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Productivity Testing</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blender 3.64 Rendering (seconds &#x2F; lower is better)</td><td>7.3</td><td>7.3</td><td>6.7</td></tr><tr><td>7-Zip Compression Test (millions of instructions per second &#x2F; higher is better)</td><td>190,613.3</td><td>189,432.5</td><td>194,953.5</td></tr><tr><td>Adobe Premiere (Puget Suite aggregate score &#x2F; higher is better)</td><td>842</td><td>828</td><td>832</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game Testing (Average FPS&#x2F;Higher Is Better)</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Six Siege @ 1080p</td><td>655.9</td><td>645.2</td><td>694.1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Six Siege @ 1440p</td><td>511.2</td><td>511.0</td><td>520.0</td></tr><tr><td>F1 2023 @ 1080p</td><td>422.1</td><td>417.5</td><td>506.5</td></tr><tr><td>F1 2023 @ 1440p</td><td>392.8</td><td>389.5</td><td>400.1</td></tr><tr><td>Baldur’s Gate 3 @ 1080p</td><td>110.2</td><td>107.8</td><td>124.9</td></tr><tr><td>Baldur’s Gate 3 @ 1440p</td><td>107.6</td><td>106.0</td><td>121.7</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fantasy XIV @ 1080p</td><td>270.0</td><td>262.0</td><td>214.2</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fantasy XIV @ 1440p</td><td>269.0</td><td>261.8</td><td>212.6</td></tr><tr><td>Starfield @ 1080p</td><td>132.4</td><td>128.8</td><td>114.0</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see in the test results, the Intel i9-14900K performs a bit better than its previous-generation counterparts. However, in many tests, AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950X3D chip posted better results than Intel’s 13th-Gen and 14th-Gen offerings.

However, since the latter was already a year old when the former launched, you can find them much cheaper than their launch prices.</p><p> For example, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i9-13900K-Desktop-Processor-P-cores/dp/B0BCF54SR1?crid=TPJ7LWWLEGQP&keywords=Intel+Core+i9-13900K&qid=1698833400&sprefix=intel+core+i9-1900k,aps,466&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.2b70bf2b-6730-4ccf-ab97-eb60747b8daf&linkCode=ll1&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=ebe8f0f9e5ff8f761e8cb280840044e4&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2030903&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-avoid-intel-14th-gen-cpu/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >get the 13900K on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $547, and<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.newegg.com/intel-core-i7-13700k-core-i7-13th-gen/p/N82E16819118414" >the 13700K is on Newegg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $394.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=13600K&crid=3CIM1ATKS2XDM&sprefix=samsung+85-inch+4k+qled+mini+led+t,aps,341&linkCode=ll2&tag=makeusw-20&linkId=3da7c8a35577727dad3e0f97551d2f64&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2030903&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-avoid-intel-14th-gen-cpu/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >The 13600K is also available on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for less than $308.</p><p> While the discount seems small compared to the 13th-Gen’s launch prices, you still save $20 to $50 over the 14th-Gen chips with an almost imperceptible difference in performance.

If you currently have a 12th or 13th-gen Intel processor or an equivalent AMD build, the 14th-Gen isn’t a worthwhile upgrade.</p><p> If you’re upgrading from an older PC, consider getting the 13th-Gen instead, as you get better value for money with them. I’ll only recommend Intel’s 14th-Gen processors if you need its Wi-Fi 7, Thunderbolt 5, and AI-powered overclocking features—or if you get a good deal on them.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-becoming-a-broadcast-pro-zooming-into-youtube-live-success/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Becoming a Broadcast Pro Zooming Into YouTube Live Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-getting-the-most-out-of-pc-hdr-videos/"><u>[Updated] Getting the Most Out of PC HDR Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-instagram-effects-into-pre-existing-content/"><u>2024 Approved Integrating Instagram Effects Into Pre-Existing Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/insights-on-the-motorola-one-5g-ace-unmatched-speeds-and-enduring-power/"><u>Insights on the Motorola One ˈ5G Ace - Unmatched Speeds and Enduring Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/is-the-trend-shifting-towards-higher-gpu-prices/"><u>Is the Trend Shifting Towards Higher GPU Prices?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/navigating-obstacles-cleaning-up-error-262-in-roblox/"><u>Navigating Obstacles: Cleaning Up Error 262 in Roblox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/nostalgic-journey-revisited-emulate-xbox-classics-on-pc/"><u>Nostalgic Journey Revisited: Emulate Xbox Classics on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/reviving-lost-icon-designs-on-iphone-proven-methods-to-fix-icon-issues/"><u>Reviving Lost Icon Designs on iPhone: Proven Methods to Fix Icon Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-making.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-mastering-the-art-of-changing-image-backdrops/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Mastering the Art of Changing Image Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/the-complete-breakdown-of-amazfits-helio-ring-release-timing-cost-analysis-and-core-features-revealed/"><u>The Complete Breakdown of Amazfit's Helio Ring: Release Timing, Cost Analysis, and Core Features Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/30364550-tiny-snippets-deciphered-important-facts/"><u>Tiny Snippets Deciphered Important Facts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-8-compact-android-versions-computers-and-macs/"><u>Top 8 Compact Android Versions, Computers & Macs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/why-portable-games-may-not-always-win/"><u>Why Portable Games May Not Always Win</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You do, of course, have to identify songs. But there is also a wide variety of more interesting questions, such as guessing which instrument a certain musician plays or what band a musician might be in.</p><p> Trivial Music Quiz does have a pop-up that appears the first time you open the app, asking for your support in keeping the game free for users by allowing it to track your data across other apps. This could turn users off, but you are not forced to agree. You still get full access to all aspects of the game if you deny the request.</p><p> There are also a number of ads in Trivial Music Quiz, but the game itself is interesting enough to ignore them.

On the first go, you only get to hear a one-second clip of the song. You can then guess the song or skip to get another second. Eventually, you do get to listen to a decent chunk of the song, but guessing right after a mere second clip would be both satisfying and impressive.</p><p> Unlike some of the other games on this list that give you four or five options to choose from, there are far more song choices in Heard-It. The options aren’t infinite, but there are dozens you can guess from, so the game doesn’t narrow it down for you much at all.</p><p> It also offers a link to the song on Spotify if you happen to love the featured song, which is yet another brilliant detail in Heard-It that makes it an excellent option for any music buff.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Hear-It Music Trivia Game for<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU43416/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KingCatGames.HeardIt&hl=en&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="4-Top-90s-Music-Trivia-Quiz-Game"><a href="#4-Top-90s-Music-Trivia-Quiz-Game" class="headerlink" title="4 Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game"></a>4 Top 90s Music Trivia Quiz Game</h2><p>Close</p><p> Maybe what you really love the most is music from the 90s.

View at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Right out of the box, this is just a good-looking TV. It has a very slim design and a super-thin bezel that truly makes the picture stand out. As I was unboxing it, the stand also caught my eye. Instead of two legs like almost all other TVs, the QN90C is supported by a single leg in the middle, similar to a computer monitor. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-samsung-tv/" >The best Samsung TVs of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Though I must admit, setting up that stand was a little cumbersome, so much so that after I read the manual and started putting it together, I had to refer back to the instructions because I couldn’t figure it out. I’d consider that a small inconvenience, though, as it’s a “one-and-done” type of thing. I feel like the sleek, premium look was eventually worth it. The stand did have a slight wobble, especially when my kids ran through the living room, but I was never worried about the set toppling over. </p><p>If inputs are a concern, the QN90C has four HDMI ports (one eARC), all of which support HDMI 2.1.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the ports on the back.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The set uses Samsung’s own Tizen software as an operating system. This was my first experience with Tizen, and while it wasn’t as user-friendly as Roku or Google TV, I could navigate where I wanted to go without much trouble. </p><p>On the display side, this is a Quantum Mini-LED, which Samsung first introduced in 2021. As the name implies, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/neo-qled-vs-oled-which-technology-is-right-for-you/" >the LEDs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are much smaller here than usual, leading to better backlight control. However, Samsung claims to take that a step further with microlayers inside the LEDs that eliminate noise.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s support for HDR10 and HDR10+, and online reports put the brightness at nearly 2,000 nits – meaning it’s bright enough for most home and office environments.</p><p>My living room has a fair amount of natural light shining where my TV sits, and this set’s display thrives in that environment, largely due to its anti-reflection film. There are times with my everyday television that I have to close my blinds because of glare, but the QN90C was bright enough to make that unnecessary. I fired up a personal favorite, Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things,</em> to test the display, and it was the most I’ve enjoyed that show visually. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/lg-vs-samsung-tv-which-brand-should-you-buy-in-2024/" >LG vs Samsung TV: Which brand should you buy in 2024? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The QN90C also utilizes local dimming control, which takes unused electrical power from dark areas of the screen and diverts it to brighter areas. I was impressed with how that worked here. Dark scenes were dark as intended, but black levels still had a contrast where things were clearly visible. Bright colors popped beautifully, and scenes with fast action showed no signs of blur. </p><p>Samsung has its Neural Quantum Processor on board for upscaling content. This uses AI to add depth and sharpness to content regardless of the original resolution—essentially making everything 4K. I tested this out with <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> and loved how things looked. I’ve had televisions where the upscaling produced far too unnatural-looking results, but the QN90C does this very well.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>When it comes to sound, this set is plenty sufficient as-is. It supports Dolby Atmos, but even without a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sound-system/" >sound bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I could hear dialogue clearly over the bustle of my two kids and dog. I keep closed captions on my everyday TV for this very reason, even when using a sound bar, and it was nice to be able to turn that off for a while.</p><p>Like other <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-samsung-tv/" >Samsung televisions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it supports object tracking, which sends sounds to the relevant part of the screen. For example, if you’re watching a movie with a racing scene, you’ll audibly notice the engine sound roar left to right along with the car.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/samsung-has-its-own-line-of-video-game-controllers-now-heres-the-first-model/" >Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here’s the first model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When I started digging into the gaming features, though, I found where this television <em>really</em> shined. It has a very low input lag (under 10ms), a 120Hz display, support for variable refresh rate, and Samsung’s above-average Game Bar feature. </p><p>Holding the pause&#x2F;play button while a video game console is on brings up the menu overlay. From there, you can dig into settings like Game Picture Mode (there are six to choose from, plus two custom options), Game Motion Plus (which reduces motion blur and improves picture quality), and an on-screen crosshair (with three color options).</p><p>From that bar, there’s a deeper game mode settings option, which lets you tune the black equalizer, choose “basic” or “advanced” for HDR, and even choose the level of judder reduction and blur reduction. </p><p>Most casual gamers wouldn’t dive this deep into these settings, but this is a fantastic thing to have for serious gamers. It’s the deepest level of customization I’ve seen from a gaming menu. I’d call this easily one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-tv/" >best gaming TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I’ve come across. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925473/19272" target="_top" id="1925473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925473/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN55QN90C/dp/B0BTTVBDVD?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca809cba9-2efa-4131-bfb0-67fc93c07357%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung QN90C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> TV has a few minor annoyances – I’m hesitant to call the wobbliness and installation process shortcomings – but its picture quality in every instance and gaming features more than made up for those.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Six-Simple-Steps-To-Engage-Your-PS5-Console"><a href="#Six-Simple-Steps-To-Engage-Your-PS5-Console" class="headerlink" title="Six Simple Steps To Engage Your PS5 Console"></a>Six Simple Steps To Engage Your PS5 Console</h2><p> The PlayStation 5 is full of surprises and secrets. Even if you’ve had yours for years, there are probably still plenty of things it can do that you don’t know about. Even things you take for granted, like turning it on, for example.</p><p> Did you know that there are approximately six different ways to turn your PS5 on? Most of them don’t even involve you touching it or being anywhere near it at all. If you want to trick your friends into thinking your PS5 is haunted by turning it on when they’re alone in the house, there are a couple of ways you can do so.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-Power-Button"><a href="#1-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-Power-Button" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the Power Button"></a>1. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the Power Button</h2><p> Pressing the power button is the most common way that gamers turn their trusty PS5s on. Almost immediately after taking your brand new PS5 out of the box and plugging it in, your trigger finger is just itching to press that power button and see what all the PS5 hype is about. And that is probably how you still turn it on to this day.</p><p> But it is also, by far, the most boring way to turn on your PS5. Not to mention the most labor-intensive since you have to lift yourself out of the couch and walk yourself all the way over to it. Thankfully, there is a much easier way. In fact, there are a number of easier ways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997643/19272" target="_top" id="1997643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997643/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Turn-Your-PS5-On-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-Your-PS5-On-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn Your PS5 On in Safe Mode"></a>2. Turn Your PS5 On in Safe Mode</h2><p> But before we get to the easiest and most convenient ways to turn your PS5 on, there is one other way to turn your console on using the power button, and it’s quite possibly the most important one of them all. That’s turning your PS5 on in Safe Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/safe-mode-menu-on-ps5-console.jpg"                      alt="Safe Mode Menu On PS5 Console"                ></p><p> You can turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode by holding the button down for six to eight seconds until you hear a second longer beep. Safe Mode allows you to access the backend of your system, where you can address many technical issues you may be having with your console.</p><p> Hopefully, you will never have to turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode, but it can be a lifesaver if you’ve been experiencing issues so it’s important for every PS5 owner to know about<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-safe-mode/" >what Safe Mode is on the PS5 and how to use it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-Remote-Play"><a href="#3-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-Remote-Play" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Your PS5 on Using Remote Play"></a>3. Turn Your PS5 on Using Remote Play</h2><p> If you’ve got yourself all rugged up on the couch and leaving the warm embrace of your safe space doesn’t quite appeal to you, you can also turn your PS5 on with your mobile device. This is an excellent way to turn your PS5 on without moving an inch, but it does require a little bit of pre-planning.</p><p> To turn your PS5 on via Remote Play, you must have downloaded the Remote Play app and connected it to your PS5 console previously.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-how-to-set-up-and-use-remote-play/" >Setting up Remote Play and using it to operate your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is quick and easy and allows you to do much more than just turn it on. With Remote Play, you can fully control your console through your phone, so you can play an entire campaign on your mobile if you want to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-PS-Button-on-Your-DualSense-Controller"><a href="#4-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-PS-Button-on-Your-DualSense-Controller" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the PS Button on Your DualSense Controller"></a>4. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the PS Button on Your DualSense Controller</h2><p> If you didn’t know that you can turn your PS5 on by pressing the PS button on your DualSense controller, your mind is about to be blown. This is by far the easiest way to turn your PS5 on, because even if your console may not always be within arm’s reach, there is a good chance your DualSense is calmly waiting for you on your coffee table.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/person-playing-on-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-rgb-lights.jpg"                      alt="Person Playing On PS5 DualSense Controller with RGB Lights"                ></p><p> And what’s easier than picking up your phone and pressing several buttons to find the PS or Remote Play app to turn your PS5 on? Picking up your DualSense controller and pushing one single button instead.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-the-PS-App"><a href="#5-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-the-PS-App" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can also turn your PS5 on through the PS App.</p><p> This is a different app than Remote Play, and it doesn’t allow you to play games via your phone, but it does have a lot of its own functionality. You can see screenshots you’ve taken on your console through the PS App, review trophies you’ve collected, as well as add and chat with friends.</p><p> And, of course, you can turn your PS5 on. To do that, make sure your console is in Rest Mode, open the app, press the<strong>controller icon</strong> at the bottom of the screen, and scroll to the game you want to play. As long as the game is currently installed on your PS5, you will be able to press<strong>Play on Console</strong> , and your PS5 will turn on for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037318/7443" target="_top" id="2037318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Turn-On-Your-PS5-With-Your-TV"><a href="#6-Turn-On-Your-PS5-With-Your-TV" class="headerlink" title="6.

If not, it can be more bothersome than helpful to have your PS5 turning on every time you want to watch Netflix or the news. That just wastes power and requires more effort from you to turn it off again.</p><p> Thankfully, it is just as easy to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-ps5-turning-on-off-with-tv/" >stop your PS5 from turning on with your TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it is to activate the setting in the first place.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Spice-Things-Up-a-Bit-Next-Time-You-Turn-On-Your-PS5"><a href="#Spice-Things-Up-a-Bit-Next-Time-You-Turn-On-Your-PS5" class="headerlink" title="Spice Things Up a Bit Next Time You Turn On Your PS5"></a>Spice Things Up a Bit Next Time You Turn On Your PS5</h2><p> Now that you are equipped with an entire arsenal of ways to turn your PS5 on, you can switch it up each time you are ready to boot up another adventure.

Arcade Sticks"></a>Gamers’ Crossroads: Console Joysticks Vs. Arcade Sticks</h2><p> The fighting game community is one of the oldest competitive video game scenes. It began with meetups in local arcades and has since become much more accessible to players.</p><p> While the platform has changed, the drive for competition remains the same, and players are always looking for an edge. So, which of the two most common inputs in the Fighting Game Community (FGC) is better: controller or arcade stick?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Factors-to-Consider"><a href="#Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Factors-to-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Factors to Consider"></a>Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Factors to Consider</h2><p> Most fighting games were first ported to consoles before becoming available on PCs. The controllers that come with these consoles have changed significantly over the years, but the original design concept remains the same.</p><p> Controllers try to capture the magic of the arcade in a smaller form factor. Some of the best controllers currently on the market, like the Xbox Series X|S controller and the PS5’s DualSense controller, go above and beyond.</p><p> While these serve their intended purpose, portable arcade sticks are now readily available to fighting game enthusiasts. Both options have their merits, and here are a few factors to consider when deciding which is best for fighting games.</p><h3 id="1-Input-Precision"><a href="#1-Input-Precision" class="headerlink" title="1. Input Precision"></a>1. Input Precision</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/darts-g42b26ee2a_1920.jpg"                      alt="Darts on a dartboard"                ></p><p> It’s time to take a closer look at what is required to be competitive in a fighting game. There’s a reason the FGC is thriving after over 30 years of competition.</p><p> Every input matters when facing the best, creating a large skill ceiling for new players to explore. The sky is the limit, provided that your precision and speed of execution are on point. With this in mind, your controller of choice needs to support input precision.</p><p> First, let’s consider the controller. Controllers have varying buttons that can be assigned to different actions in-game. However, movement is usually restricted to two options. You could either use a joystick or a D-Pad. As freeing as both options can be, they do have their problems.</p><p> The joystick is pretty small and can be imprecise when used by a novice.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-joystick-drift/" >Joysticks are also prone to stick drift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after prolonged use, which could cause your character to move unprompted. On the other hand, the D-Pad is a bit more precise but harder to use with a limited range of motion.</p><p> An arcade stick trumps a controller in terms of input precision. The stick is fairly large and combines the freedom of movement a joystick offers with the precision of a D-Pad. Most arcade sticks come with eight input buttons, which is typically sufficient for most games. However, players are forced to use button combinations for other in-game actions.</p><p> So, while an arcade stick is precise, it requires more skill than a controller.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135471">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135471%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135471/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Durability"><a href="#2-Durability" class="headerlink" title="2.

As such, it is important to consider the durability of your input of choice before purchasing one. So, let’s look at the build quality of most controllers.</p><p> There are two sides to this argument. Some users praise newer controllers for their ingenuity and solid build, while others feel they aren’t as good as they used to be.</p><p> The fact is, controllers degrade a lot quicker than before. However, this can also be attributed to the rise in competitive gaming. While we aren’t privy to the manufacturing processes of most mainstream controllers, we can see the process behind creating an arcade stick.</p><p> A few YouTube channels cover arcade stick customization, which displays how solid the build quality is. Ultimately, arcade sticks are specifically designed to take a lot of abuse and last a long time.</p><p> A high-quality arcade stick can last five to six years without maintenance and even longer when maintained periodically. Controllers, however, need to be changed more frequently and are costly to fix when damaged.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Functional-Buttons"><a href="#3-Functional-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="3.

As such, it is important to research what your game of choice requires to get the best user experience.</p><p> Controllers typically have a lot more functional buttons than arcade sticks. They come with face and shoulder buttons which most modern fighting games incorporate into their control schemes.</p><p> However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/why-gamers-swear-arcade-sticks/" >a reason some gamers swear by arcade sticks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is their customizability. You can take your arcade stick apart, change the layout and add whatever buttons you feel are necessary to compete in your game of choice.</p><p> One downside of this approach is the technical knowledge required to customize an arcade stick. Ultimately, a controller might be the better choice depending on how many functional buttons a fighting game requires.</p><h3 id="4-Feedback"><a href="#4-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="4.

Feedback</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/untitled-design-3.jpg"                      alt="A vibrating PS5 controller"                ></p><p> Feedback in console games has been a big thing since the release of early dual-shock controllers. Most modern fighting game titles allow for varying degrees of feedback. It can be as small as a little vibration when your player gets hit.</p><p> However, not every professional player likes the distraction some of these vibrations could cause, so it isn’t often a factor to consider when choosing between arcade sticks and controllers. Regardless, it still boils down to choice.</p><p> A controller is the best option if you are the type of player that likes feedback when playing your fighting games. Arcade sticks do not come with vibrational feedback in any form.</p><p> However, some enthusiasts are playing around with the idea of introducing haptic feedback to arcade sticks. It is also worth noting that the DualSense controller, in particular, supports haptic feedback, which can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/force-haptic-feedback-games/" >make your fighting games a bit more immersive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h3 id="5-Ergonomics"><a href="#5-Ergonomics" class="headerlink" title="5.

Assessing the best ways to optimize your environment for prolonged sitting is important, especially when you spend long hours playing your fighting game of choice.</p><p> Your controller of choice can contribute to the ergonomics of your setup, as surprising as that may sound. Here’s what I mean.</p><p> A controller allows for a more relaxed posture, as gamers can move their controllers as they please. Modern controllers are also designed to fit in many grip styles for prolonged periods. Also, a controller allows you to be further away from the screen and sit on as comfortable of a chair as you own.</p><p> An arcade stick, on the other hand, is large and clunky. One could rest the box on their lap or place it on a table. The first option promotes hunching over during gaming sessions and can be bad for your back.</p><p> You can limit the damage by placing your arcade stick on an adjustable table. An adjustable table allows you to experiment with different heights until you find the one that allows you to sit straight while using your arcade stick.</p><p> However, this is a lot of trouble just to game comfortably. Consequently, there’s no denying that a controller is better ergonomically than an arcade stick.</p><h3 id="6-Compatibility"><a href="#6-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="6. Compatibility"></a>6. Compatibility</h3><p> This is the ultimate factor when choosing between a controller and an arcade stick. Now, most fighting games are available both on console and PC. However, does your device support a controller or a fighting stick? Or does it support both? Also, how easily can you hook up your controller or fight stick to your device?</p><p> Well, both consoles and PCs support controllers to varying degrees. Controllers work well with their matching console and also on PC. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S controllers are plug-and-play compatible with Windows.</p><p> Most fighting games operate on Steam, which has facilities that support traditional controllers and arcade sticks. So, you shouldn’t have a problem with either option if you run your game on Steam.</p><p> On the other hand, consoles are very picky about the arcade sticks permitted to run on the platform. As such, you’ll need to research and discover what arcade sticks your console supports.</p><p> Long story short, compatibility is a limiting factor affecting console players more than their PC Counterparts. Both inputs work seamlessly on PC, while only a small selection of both work on consoles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Which-Is-the-Better-Option"><a href="#Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Which-Is-the-Better-Option" class="headerlink" title="Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Which Is the Better Option?"></a>Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Which Is the Better Option?</h2><p> After going over a few criteria integral to deciding what input you should choose, let’s come to a vrerdict.

Many were initially skeptical about the concept, and with good reason, but over time, we’ve learned to embrace it—especially as it has improved over time. DLSS has been a game-changer on NVIDIA’s GPUs, and AMD’s own FSR solution is seen as inferior by many.</p><p> However, that doesn’t mean AMD has given up on FSR. Far from it, in fact. At Gamescom 2023, alongside the launch of its new GPUs, AMD also announced FSR 3, which promises great improvements over its predecessor in performance and image fidelity. It’s a major upgrade, but can it compete with NVIDIA DLSS 3.5?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997717/19272" target="_top" id="1997717">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997717" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997717/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-AMD’s-FSR-3"><a href="#What-Is-AMD’s-FSR-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is AMD’s FSR 3?"></a>What Is AMD’s FSR 3?</h2><p> You might already know what FSR, or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/amd-fsr-explained/" >FidelityFX Super Resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , is, but we’ll give you a quick refresh if not. FSR is software that takes games rendered at a lower resolution and upscales them to higher ones. It’s AMD’s competition to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-deep-learning-super-sampling-can-give-budget-pcs-top-end-graphics/" >NVIDIA’s DLSS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , boosting in-game visuals and frame rates, and FSR 3 is the latest version of this technology. AMD announced the new tech right as it announced its newest GPUs, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/everything-you-need-to-know-amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt-and-rx-7700-xt/" >Radeon RX 7800 XT and the Radeon RX 7700 XT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> FSR 3 isn’t fundamentally changing the way FSR works. It’s still an open technology that doesn’t require proprietary hardware and can run on any modern GPU, AMD or not. What’s changing here is how good its results look and how fast games will run with FSR 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fsr-3-1.jpeg"                      alt="AMD FSR 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image Credits: AMD</p><p> AMD is employing a series of new party tricks to further improve its experience, including one called “Fluid Motion Frames.” Essentially, it’s a competitor to DLSS’s Frame Generation, which generates and fits new frames between actual rendered frames, dramatically improving your frame rates. Fluid Motion Frames will be supported on games that support FSR 3 and in all DirectX 11 and 12 games, as long as you have a Radeon 7000-Series GPU.</p><p> FSR 3 will be available on all Radeon RDNA cards (5000-Series, 6000-Series, and 7000-Series), Intel Arc GPUs, and NVIDIA RTX GPUs.</p><h2 id="How-Does-FSR-3-Compare-to-DLSS-3-5"><a href="#How-Does-FSR-3-Compare-to-DLSS-3-5" class="headerlink" title="How Does FSR 3 Compare to DLSS 3.5?"></a>How Does FSR 3 Compare to DLSS 3.5?</h2><p> Of course, the big elephant in the room is how AMD’s FSR 3 fares compared to its direct competitor,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-3-5/" >NVIDIA’s recently updated DLSS 3.5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . NVIDIA announced its latest technology just days before FSR 3, as basically a drop-in upgrade for DLSS 3-compatible cards. DLSS 3.5’s biggest upgrade is how it leverages the power of AI to help with its upscaling, employing a model called Ray Reconstruction to create high-quality ray-traced images.</p><p> FSR 3 doesn’t really employ any AI tricks. It’s still algorithm-based, which seems to work for AMD now. The thing about FSR is that it seems to be catching up to DLSS 3 rather than DLSS 3.5. Its flagship feature, Fluid Motion Frames, is just an answer to Frame Generation, which was introduced with DLSS 3.</p><p> As for how well it works compared to its direct competitor, we’ll have to see FSR 3 in use in-game to compare properly. We’d expect things to remain pretty similar to how they are, with FSR producing similar framerate gains but with less detail than DLSS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043662/7443" target="_top" id="2043662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043662/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Use-FSR-3"><a href="#Should-You-Use-FSR-3" class="headerlink" title="Should You Use FSR 3?"></a>Should You Use FSR 3?</h2><p> If you have an AMD GPU or another GPU that doesn’t support DLSS, using FSR is a no-brainer. It can greatly help your framerates, especially if you have a higher-resolution monitor. FSR 3 is a great improvement to an already great technology, and you should give it a spin as soon as it’s available. AMD says that new titles Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum will get support in September, with other games following suit.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FSR-3-is-a-Big-Improvement"><a href="#FSR-3-is-a-Big-Improvement" class="headerlink" title="FSR 3 is a Big Improvement"></a>FSR 3 is a Big Improvement</h2><p> When NVIDIA added Frame Generation to DLSS 3, it was a big breakthrough. By generating extra frames from scratch, your frame rates could be effectively doubled. With this addition to FSR 3, you should see the same kind of gains, and we’re excited to see how it fares in real life.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2023-facebook-short-videos-and-everything-about-them-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 2023 | Facebook Short Videos and Everything About Them for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-transform-your-mac-with-the-latest-macos-11-big-sur-overview/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transform Your Mac with the Latest MacOS 11 Big Sur Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/auroras-dynamic-range-feature-a-detailed-perspective/"><u>Aurora's Dynamic Range Feature A Detailed Perspective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-blue-light-filtering-monitor-covers/"><u>Best Blue Light Filtering Monitor Covers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/best-zte-nubia-flip-5g-pattern-lock-removal-tools-remove-android-pattern-lock-without-losing-data-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best ZTE Nubia Flip 5G Pattern Lock Removal Tools Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/cheap-gaming-conquered-top-11-websites-for-low-cost-games/"><u>Cheap Gaming Conquered: Top 11 Websites for Low-Cost Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/chronicles-of-triumph-ranking-the-ultimate-game-odysseys/"><u>Chronicles of Triumph Ranking the Ultimate Game Odysseys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/effective-management-of-multiple-xbox-subscriptions-in-a-single-console/"><u>Effective Management of Multiple Xbox Subscriptions in a Single Console</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-future-ready-steam-decks/"><u>Exploring Future-Ready Steam Decks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-pokemon-go-route-not-working-on-apple-iphone-xr-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Fix Pokemon Go Route Not Working On Apple iPhone XR? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/safeguarding-your-playstation-5-games-with-a-passcode/"><u>Safeguarding Your PlayStation 5 Games with a Passcode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-most-immersive-mobile-mmo-experiences/"><u>The Most Immersive Mobile MMO Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/1725290265908-windows-11-windows-11/"><u>Windows 11 電影製作器免費下載方法 - 如何在 Windows 11 中使用</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The Royale mode in Playstudio’s official Tetris app used to be the answer. But as of August 2023, the mode wasn’t available for new players for some strange reason, leaving those that’d rather T-Flip other players on a mobile device feeling shortchanged.</p><p> But not to worry! You’ve still got two solid options to play Tetris competitively. Let’s take a look.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Play-Tetris-Against-Other-People-in-Your-Phone’s-Browser-With-Jstris"><a href="#Play-Tetris-Against-Other-People-in-Your-Phone’s-Browser-With-Jstris" class="headerlink" title="Play Tetris Against Other People in Your Phone’s Browser With Jstris"></a>Play Tetris Against Other People in Your Phone’s Browser With Jstris</h2><p> The easiest way to start playing Tetris competitively on Android or iPhone is to visit the<a class="link"   href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/" >Jstris <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> homepage in your preferred mobile browser. It’s completely free.</p><p> Jstris automatically defaults to the Live gameplay mode. Here, you’re placed in a room to compete in round-to-round games of knockout, with the goal to clear as many lines as possible to pile garbage gray tetriminos—the famous Tetris shapes—onto the other player. As in classic Tetris, once the tetriminos go off-screen, it’s game over.</p><p> The danger of garbage tetriminos in addition to the already dropping pieces, along with the consequence of dropping rank while playing in Ranked mode, really adds to the already hectic frenzy of Tetris.</p><p> If ranking sounds fun and you’re ready to dive in, register for a free account. You’ll want to do it anyway, as you get to eye your stats, and Jstris seems to value registered players over guest players. Once you’re logged in, refresh the homepage to play Live mode.

The controls are extremely responsive, and it’s clear that some time has been taken into how the blocks are controlled in a mobile browser. Controlling them quickly becomes second nature, and the focus on pure gameplay over trying to trick you into spending money is refreshing.</p><p> This is competitive Tetris at its purest, and the addition of niche modes like Cheese makes this a solid option for playing competitive Tetris on Android and iPhone.</p><p> On board?<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-turn-any-website-android-app-seconds/" >Turn the website into an app for your Android phone’s home screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to compete against players around the world, wherever.</p><h2 id="Play-Competitive-Tetris-on-Your-Phone-via-the-Steam-Link-App"><a href="#Play-Competitive-Tetris-on-Your-Phone-via-the-Steam-Link-App" class="headerlink" title="Play Competitive Tetris on Your Phone via the Steam Link App"></a>Play Competitive Tetris on Your Phone via the Steam Link App</h2><p> If you prefer your flavor of competitive Tetris to look like it was released in this century, consider Tetris Effect: Connected instead.

But thankfully, Apple updated its<a class="link"   href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0kjli9o1" >App Review Guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in April 2024 to allow retro game console emulators on the App Store.</p><p> As a result, you can now easily install Delta just like any other app. But before you can actually use the app to play Nintendo games, you need the ROM file for the game you want to play. But how do you get the ROM file, you ask?</p><p> If you own the game cartridge, you can use a cartridge dumper like<a class="link"   href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator" >Epilogue’s GB Operator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with your PC to extract the ROM file from your cartridge legally. Then, you can transfer the ROM file from your PC to your iPhone and follow the steps below in Delta to start playing:</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688" >Delta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><ol><li>Tap<strong>Get</strong> on Delta’s App Store page to install it on your iPhone.</li><li>Launch the app and tap the<strong>plus (+)</strong> icon in the top-right corner.</li><li>Choose<strong>Files</strong> from the context menu and browse to the directory where you saved the ROM file.</li><li>Select the ROM file, and it’ll show up in the app. Now, just tap the game to run it. All the console controls will appear on the bottom half of your screen.</li></ol><p>Close</p><p> The catch with GB Operator is that you can only use it to extract ROMs from Game Boy cartridges. However, you can find similar tools if you own other retro Nintendo consoles like NES, SNES, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 64, etc.</p><p> Keep in mind that your ROM files should be in one of the following formats, depending on the console Nintendo made the game for:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Console</th><th>Supported File Formats</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NES</td><td>.nes</td></tr><tr><td>SNES</td><td>.smc, .sfc, .fig</td></tr><tr><td>Game Boy</td><td>.gb</td></tr><tr><td>Game Boy Color</td><td>.gbc</td></tr><tr><td>Game Boy Advance</td><td>.gba</td></tr><tr><td>Nintendo DS</td><td>.ds, .nds</td></tr><tr><td>Nintendo 64</td><td>.n64, .z64</td></tr></tbody></table><p> While Delta supports Nintendo DS, you can’t play Nintendo DS games out of the box even if you have the ROM files. That’s because Delta requires you to manually add the DS BIOS files by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Launch Delta and tap the<strong>gear</strong> icon in the top-left corner to go to its settings menu.</li><li>Scroll down and tap<strong>Nintendo DS</strong> under<strong>Core Settings</strong> .</li><li>You’ll see three filenames under the DS BIOS Files section at the bottom. You need to import these files just like you imported your ROM files before.</li></ol><p>Close</p><p> Like ROM files, downloading or importing BIOS files for consoles you don’t own is strictly illegal. So, unless you own a Nintendo DS, don’t try to import its BIOS files into Delta.</p><p> As you can see, setting up the Delta emulator to play Nintendo games is pretty straightforward as long as you have the required files.
