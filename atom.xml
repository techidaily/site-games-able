    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Craftsmads-and-Fun-Try-Larger-Arcade-Cabinet-Framing"><a href="#Craftsmads-and-Fun-Try-Larger-Arcade-Cabinet-Framing" class="headerlink" title="Craftsmads and Fun: Try Larger Arcade Cabinet Framing"></a>Craftsmads and Fun: Try Larger Arcade Cabinet Framing</h2><p> If you’re a gamer of a certain age, you likely have fond memories of your local arcade. Clutching your coins, challenging locals, and the rush of a crowd watching you succeed: the arcade delivered an experience unlike any other.</p><p> The good news is modern technology makes it possible to not only replicate those golden years, but make the experience of playing via an arcade even better than you remember. The secret to that sauce is a frontend designed with arcade play in mind, and it’s hard to beat Big Box, courtesy of LaunchBox—here’s why.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets"><a href="#What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets" class="headerlink" title="What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?"></a>What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?</h2><p> Think about the components needed to operate an arcade cabinet. You at least need a joystick with a set of buttons, speakers, a monitor, a cabinet, and a device to run the whole thing, like a desktop. But how do you navigate the system once it’s set up? That’s where frontend software comes in.</p><p> Frontend software finds the games installed on your device, displays them in an easy-to-navigate library, and lets you select each game via your arcade cabinet’s controls alone. It’s the same principle behind the software that allows you to explore your library on a PS5 or via the Steam client on your desktop using a gaming controller.</p><p> A frontend also adds order to the chaos that is your ROM collection. You want to know what you’re going to be playing before you select it. So you need to add key metadata for each game, like the title, platform, thumbnail art, etc., to make everything look nice and tidy.</p><p> This can take days of work alone. But not with Big Box. Let’s dig a bit deeper and learn why a premium subscription to LaunchBox is worth the cost of admission alone for Big Box if you’re setting up your own arcade cabinet.</p><h2 id="1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata"><a href="#1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata" class="headerlink" title="1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata"></a>1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata</h2><p> Whether you’ve tackled big projects, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >building a portable retro gaming console using a Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or added a few classic arcade games to your work desktop, you know how painful it is to organize your collection. You are forced to add in every bit of metadata manually in most cases, including hunting down individual bits of media for each game, like a bezel, screenshot, video, and so on.</p><p> It’s painful work, and for those with massive collections, you’ll be more prone to not organize anything. Don’t do that! Organize now to make it easier to find precisely what you want to play, and you’ll use it more frequently than not, guaranteed.</p><p> Leveraging the power of Big Box via EmuMovies automatically finds all of the metadata for each game automatically, allows you to essentially set it and forget it! But you’ll need to be a premium member of both, then link your EmuMovies account to LaunchBox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/configure-emumovies-1.jpg"                      alt="Linking EmuMovies and Launchbox"                ></p><p> Once linked, everything from bezels and marquees to videos, screenshots, and even descriptions about each game will populate each game’s entry. So when you’re searching through your library in Big Box, you get a vibrant, informative listing about each game so you know what you’re about to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/import-flyers-bezels-etc.jpg"                      alt="Importing metadata into Launchbox"                ></p><p> This saves days’ worth of work alone, and means <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/launchbox-premium-worth-buying/" >LaunchBox Premium is worth the cost of admission <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> highly recommend getting a lifetime subscription to both LaunchBox and EmuMovies. You’re looking at $135 for both licenses as of July 2023.</p><p> But in terms of ease-of-use and the time saved alone, it’s going to be money well spent. Especially if you want your arcade cabinet to grow with you as you keep adding games via Steam or another source.</p><h2 id="2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library"><a href="#2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library" class="headerlink" title="2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library"></a>2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library</h2><p> Want to know the importance of context? Look at this listing below as an example. If I had not used EmuMovies as I discussed a moment ago, this cabinet would be nothing but a list of games.</p><p> But because I imported the metadata a moment ago, now this listing has a description, trailer, a banner image, and even music from the game. It’s as informative as a listing of an episode or film on your favorite streaming service, making it easy to choose the game you want to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/emu-movies-front-page.jpg"                      alt="Game page in EmuMovies"                ></p><p> If you’re already familiar with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-launchbox-how-it-works/" >LaunchBox and how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you already know that you can add custom filters for your games, like the number of players per game or by genre. The filters you create in LaunchBox also appear in Big Box, making it easy to find the right game for the occasion.</p><h2 id="3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls"><a href="#3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls" class="headerlink" title="3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls"></a>3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls</h2><p> If you’re building your arcade cabinet for the first time, you’re probably wondering how the heck you’re going to be able to exit a game or adjust the volume. You may think you need dedicated buttons, and while that’s one route, Big Box solves this problem by allowing you to hotkey certain tasks.</p><p> For example, when I want to exit a game, I tap my<strong>Player 1 Start button</strong> and<strong>A button</strong> simultaneously twice to activate the<strong>Close the Active Window</strong> value, which exits my game. I can also do a different button combination for the volume control, among other functions.</p><h2 id="4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees"><a href="#4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees" class="headerlink" title="4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees"></a>4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees</h2><p> When you populate your library with metadata via EmuMovies, you probably notice that a marquee file is always downloaded. These files are used with a second screen, displayed as a marquee like a traditional arcade cabinet.</p><p> Once you have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-dual-monitors/" >set up dual monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your arcade system, go into Big Box then select<strong>Options &gt; General &gt; Marquee Screen &gt; Screen 2</strong> . Now, whenever you highlight a game in Big Box, your second screen will display the marquee for that particular game, usually reflective of the cabinet it was in during its heyday. It’s a nice touch that goes a long way toward making your cabinet feel authentic yet new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/second-screen-marquee-big-box.jpg"                      alt="Example of a second screen marquee in BigBox"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Unbroken Software LLC&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1gBLJ2IZJI" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell"><a href="#5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell"></a>5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell</h2><p> You don’t want to have to use a mouse to open Big Box every time your start the device running your cabinet. It’s preferable if you can dive right into your arcade cabinet’s frontend with as few steps as possible. Fortunately, Big Box makes it happen if your arcade cabinet is powered by Windows.</p><p> First, be sure that the device powering your arcade cabinet automatically logs into your account. For example, there are a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/automatically-sign-user-in-windows-10/" >ways to automatically sign into your account in Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Whatever operating system you are using, be sure it automatically logs in every time the device starts.</p><p> Next, start Big Box from LaunchBox. Then, go to <strong>System &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Enable Using Big Box as the Windows Shell &gt; Yes.</strong> The next time you reboot your device, Big Box will replace the Windows shell. If you need to get into Windows, you can still close Big Box via the Task Manager to gain access to Windows again.</p><h2 id="Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends"><a href="#Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends" class="headerlink" title="Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends"></a>Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends</h2><p> The amount of time and frustration saved alone is worth the cost of admission for LaunchBox and EmuMovies. It’s layered tidily in Big Box, making navigating your library of games via arcade controls so easy, you’ll wonder why other frontends are so complicated. Give it a shot, and you’ll become one of the converted.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/your-exclusive-guide-to-top-8-gaming-websites/"><u>Your Exclusive Guide to Top 8 Gaming Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/excellent-ssd-options-for-ps5-gaming/"><u>Excellent SSD Options for PS5 Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/redefining-player-value-4-pivotal-enhancements-for-xbox-rewards/"><u>Redefining Player Value: 4 Pivotal Enhancements for Xbox Rewards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/spring-into-action-with-augmented-gaming/"><u>Spring Into Action with Augmented Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/decoding-ea-play-value-for-your-dollar/"><u>Decoding EA Play: Value for Your Dollar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/simplified-pathways-to-restart-steam/"><u>Simplified Pathways to Restart Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/valve-cuts-off-abuse-avenues-in-gaming-refunds/"><u>Valve Cuts Off Abuse Avenues in Gaming Refunds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/achieving-perfection-a-complete-ps4-factory-reset/"><u>Achieving Perfection: A Complete PS4 Factory Reset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/pitch-perfect-your-guide-to-the-best-mobile-sports-apps-iosandroid/"><u>Pitch Perfect: Your Guide to the Best Mobile Sports Apps (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/accelerating-video-conversion-youtube-to-mpeg-edition-for-2024/"><u>Accelerating Video Conversion  YouTube to MPEG Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-15-apps-to-hack-wifi-password-on-poco-x6-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 15 Apps To Hack WiFi Password On Poco X6 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-simulate-gps-movement-in-ar-games-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-premier-list-visionary-audiovideo-makers-web/"><u>[Updated] The Premier List  Visionary Audio/Video Makers Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-turning-twitter-video-into-engaging-customizable-gifs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Turning Twitter Video Into Engaging Customizable GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-epic-creators-colloquium/"><u>The Epic Creator's Colloquium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-freenocam-software-features/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, A Deep Dive Into FreenoCam Software Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/expert-strategies-to-capture-snapchats-on-devices-for-2024/"><u>Expert Strategies to Capture Snapchats on Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-samsung-galaxy-a05s-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Sim Unlock Samsung Galaxy A05s Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/showcasing-self-with-instagram-a-collection-of-100-captions-for-2024/"><u>Showcasing Self with Instagram  A Collection of 100 Captions for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Micro stuttering is when your visuals look jumpy or jittery despite your FPS counter claiming everything is running smoothly. These skips are most noticeable when playing games or browsing online, especially if VSync is enabled.</p><p> The issue currently relates specifically to Nvidia GPUs, and Nvidia is aware of it. So, if you’ve noticed micro stuttering after a recent Nvidia GPU driver update, the Nvidia version 551.46 driver should fix things again. If it doesn’t, you may instead need to perform a more in-depth fix. Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-game-stutter-fix/" >how to fix game stuttering on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h2 id="How-to-Download-and-Install-an-Nvidia-Driver-Update"><a href="#How-to-Download-and-Install-an-Nvidia-Driver-Update" class="headerlink" title="How to Download and Install an Nvidia Driver Update "></a>How to Download and Install an Nvidia Driver Update <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-and-rtx-4080-gpus-together.jpg"                      alt="nvidia rtx 4070 super and rtx 4080 gpus together"                ></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/geforce-rtx-40-super-series" >Nvidia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> As said, Nvidia is aware of the micro stuttering issue affecting its GPUs. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia driver version 551.46 (the driver fix for this issue) isn’t available via the typical methods to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/" >update your Nvidia graphics card drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Right now, the patch is in a beta state, so you need to download and install it manually.</p><p> To grab the newest Nvidia driver, head to the <a class="link"   href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/5519?=&linkId=100000240085402" >Nvidia version 551.46 driver download page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and grab it from there. However, because it’s a beta driver, there’s an extra caveat:</p><blockquote><p>To be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is. They are run through a much abbreviated QA process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly. The safest option is to wait for the next WHQL certified driver.</p></blockquote><p> As such, before you install this driver, it’s best to learn about <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/" >how to roll back your graphics drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in case the beta driver ends up causing more issues than it fixes.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="11-Cross-Platform-Mobile-Multiplayer-Games-to-Play-With-Friends"><a href="#11-Cross-Platform-Mobile-Multiplayer-Games-to-Play-With-Friends" class="headerlink" title="11 Cross-Platform Mobile Multiplayer Games to Play With Friends"></a>11 Cross-Platform Mobile Multiplayer Games to Play With Friends</h2><p> If you and your friends can’t agree on whether Android or iOS is better for mobile gaming, don’t worry. There’s actually no need to choose between them because everyone can play cross-platform games on both operating systems.</p><p> So, the next time you’re looking for multiplayer games to play with friends, try the cross-platform mobile titles below.</p><h2 id="1-Spaceteam"><a href="#1-Spaceteam" class="headerlink" title="1. Spaceteam"></a>1. Spaceteam</h2><p> Spaceteam is the one game on this list that requires all your friends to be in the same physical space.</p><p> In Spaceteam, you and your friends are the crew of a spaceship, and everything’s going wrong. To stay on course, you’ll need to work together by shouting different made-up space commands to each other. The speed and the chaos ramp up and up until you all inevitably crash and die, only to be awarded medals posthumously. But it’s fun while it lasts.</p><p> If you have a smaller friend group, you can also try out the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-two-player-mobile-games/" >best two-player mobile games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Spaceteam for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/spaceteam/id570510529" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sleepingbeastgames.spaceteam" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="2-Words-With-Friends-2"><a href="#2-Words-With-Friends-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Words With Friends 2"></a>2. Words With Friends 2</h2><p>The sequel to the acclaimed Words With Friends is more like an update.</p><p> Of course, there’s the regular Words With Friends experience that you’re used to, where you and a friend or online stranger take turns trying to rack up points on a board by spelling out words Scrabble-style.</p><p> However, while Words With Friends 2 keeps everything you loved about the first version, it adds a few new modes for a different challenge.</p><p> Lightning Round pits two teams of five against each other to see who can come up with a certain score in the fastest time. Solo Challenge lets you play against challenging bots to win a virtual prize. Finally, Words With Friends Live drops in with HQ Trivia-style questions during your game.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Words With Friends 2 for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/words-with-friends-2-word-game/id1196764367" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.words3" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="3-Pokemon-UNITE"><a href="#3-Pokemon-UNITE" class="headerlink" title="3. Pokémon UNITE"></a>3. Pokémon UNITE</h2><p> A MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) similar to League of Legends, Pokémon UNITE offers more fast-paced, streamlined gameplay for quick on-demand teamwork battles.</p><p> Choose from one of over 40 Pokémon and go head-to-head against another team in Unite Battles in order to score more points before the time runs out. Travel across the map to battle wild Pokémon, gather energy and experience, and work together as a team while inviting your friends along.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Pokémon UNITE for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-unite/id1512321575" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="4-Teamfight-Tactics"><a href="#4-Teamfight-Tactics" class="headerlink" title="4. Teamfight Tactics"></a>4. Teamfight Tactics</h2><p> Riot Games’ auto chess title provides a competitive experience with familiar League of Legends’ champions. Draft and play champions while aiming to create the best team.</p><p> With full cross-platform support, play normal or ranked matches with your friends as you learn the best synergies and items that work together. It’s also one of the best multiplayer PvP games for both mobile and PC!</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Teamfight Tactics for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/tft-teamfight-tactics/id1480616748" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riotgames.league.teamfighttactics" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="5-Minecraft"><a href="#5-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="5. Minecraft"></a>5. Minecraft</h2><p> Originally referred to as the Pocket Edition, the mobile version of Minecraft is almost identical to the PC version. The only significant difference is that you can’t connect third-party mods or use third-party servers. Also, typically, any update that comes out for Minecraft won’t come out for the mobile versions until a later date.</p><p> That said, the mobile version is a wonderful way to experience Minecraft on the go.</p><p> Playing Minecraft alone, however, is no fun. No matter the platform, Minecraft was made for socializing, and its cross-compatibility lets you play with your friends. If Minecraft doesn’t sate your adventuring itch or allow for enough relaxing world-building, you can try out these <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/serene-gaming-apps-reduce-anxiety-stress/" >serene gaming apps to help reduce feelings of anxiety and stress <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Minecraft for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/minecraft/id479516143" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($6.99 [iOS], $6.99 [Android], in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="6-Hearthstone"><a href="#6-Hearthstone" class="headerlink" title="6. Hearthstone"></a>6. Hearthstone</h2><p> Real-life trading card games are fun, but online trading card games let you do things like summon demons and blow up your booster packs.</p><p> Hearthstone, developed by Blizzard and set in the world of Warcraft, is a strategy game that lets you collect cards, build decks, and duel your friends. It’s free to play, but you can buy new card packs to give yourself that extra edge.</p><p> With periodic expansions, tournaments, and challenges, there’s always a reason to get back into Hearthstone. Play your friends in the Arena or battle strangers to increase your Rank.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Hearthstone for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/hearthstone/id625257520" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="7-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#7-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="7. Pokémon Go"></a>7. Pokémon Go</h2><p> When it debuted, Pokémon Go smashed the glass ceiling for AR (Augmented Reality) gaming, bringing pocket monsters into the real world. You and your friends can take your phones, whether Android or iOS, and go out into the real world and explore.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Pokémon Go for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="8-PUBG-Mobile"><a href="#8-PUBG-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="8. PUBG Mobile"></a>8. PUBG Mobile</h2><p> The world’s classic battle royale game is available on pretty much any platform you can think of, including iOS and Android.</p><p> While the mobile version of Fortnite also scratches this itch, accessing Fortnite on Android and iOS requires additional steps for a mixed-platform team-up. Comparatively, PUBG Mobile offers a straightforward download for both Android and iOS devices. But if you’re looking for an equally robust, event-ready competitor, PUBG Mobile definitely offers this.</p><p> Plus, with its typically sub-30-minute match time, it’s one of the easier phone games to play with your friends online.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> PUBG Mobile for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pubg-mobile-arcane/id1330123889" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="9-Mario-Kart-Tour"><a href="#9-Mario-Kart-Tour" class="headerlink" title="9. Mario Kart Tour"></a>9. Mario Kart Tour</h2><p> While many cross-platform mobile multiplayer games focus on a more typical battle game archetype, the racing sub-genre shouldn’t be forgotten. While Mario Kart remains a strong option on the Nintendo Switch, your friends on mobile don’t need to be left out.</p><p> While single player mode is fun on its own, Mario Kart offers both a race or battle multiplayer mode. It’s a simple matter to create a room for your friends and set-up either a race or battle. Plus, you can set up a room code if you want to keep your multiplayer experience private.</p><p> Plus, if Mario Kart Tour triggers your nostalgia itch, you’re not limited to Mario games with friends. There’s even a convenient way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/play-classic-mario-games-android/" >play classic Super Mario games on Android devices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Mario Kart Tour for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mario-kart-tour/id1293634699" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaka" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="10-Old-School-RuneScape"><a href="#10-Old-School-RuneScape" class="headerlink" title="10.

League of Legends: Wild Rift</h2><p> If you’ve been a fan of Riot Games’ League of Legends franchise, taking to the Rift with friends on mobile was previously impossible. While League of Legends: Wild Rift doesn’t support crossplay with PC players, Android and iOS users can queue up in duos, trios, or a complete five-person party as you target the enemy’s nexus. With Riot’s MOBA mobile launch, you can now play a full phone game with your friends.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> League of Legends: Wild Rift for <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34763/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riotgames.league.wildrift" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="More-Mobile-Games-to-Play-With-Friends"><a href="#More-Mobile-Games-to-Play-With-Friends" class="headerlink" title="More Mobile Games to Play With Friends"></a>More Mobile Games to Play With Friends</h2><p> So there we have it, a selection of the best cross-platform multiplayer games to play on mobile.

Games like Call of Duty, Halo, and Counter-Strike are among the best tactical shooters you can play. However, if you don’t want to spend money on these games, you might want to try browser-based FPS games instead.</p><p> Unfortunately, a lot of the best FPS browser games have been discontinued. This leaves us with indie FPS games that are playable but tend to come with standard indie game problems. In this article, we list the best FPS browser games you can play directly on the web right now.</p><h2 id="1-Rush-Team"><a href="#1-Rush-Team" class="headerlink" title="1. Rush Team "></a>1. Rush Team <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/browser-shooter-rush-team.png"                      alt="The player standing in front of a crate on Rush Team"                ></h2><p> Rush Team is the game you play if you want a traditional, bare-bones shooter experience. Don’t come into this one expecting flashy effects, innovative gameplay, or anything else that’s anywhere near industry-changing. An FPS packed with competitiveness and combat, it’s one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-highly-tactical-shooters-that-are-worth-your-time/" >best tactical shooters you need to play <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> even if it’s “only” a browser game.</p><p> You’ll find the usual gameplay elements: melee weapons, pistols, rifles, grenades, etc. A<strong>Free For All</strong> mode is available, but Rush Team becomes even better when played in one of its team-based, objective-focused modes. Some cosmetic and gameplay features are only available to VIPs, but you’ll be fine without them.</p><h2 id="2-Warmerise-Red-vs-Blue"><a href="#2-Warmerise-Red-vs-Blue" class="headerlink" title="2. Warmerise: Red vs. Blue "></a>2. Warmerise: Red vs. Blue <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/browser-shooter-warmerise.png"                      alt="The player standing in front of caravans on the browser FPS Warmerise"                ></h2><p> Warmerise: Red vs. Blue looks closer in aesthetics to 90s-era shooters like Quake and the original Counter-Strike, but it’s balanced out by its gameplay and player activity. Mainly featuring elimination-based game modes, it has vehicular combat that makes it unique.</p><p> In terms of the player base, Warmerise: Red vs. Blue is one of the healthiest FPS browser-based games. Matches are easy to find even during off-peak hours in the U.S. All in all, if you can get over the outdated graphics, this is a solid choice for a browser shooter.</p><h2 id="3-Wolfenstein-3D"><a href="#3-Wolfenstein-3D" class="headerlink" title="3. Wolfenstein 3D "></a>3. Wolfenstein 3D <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/browser-shooter-wolfenstein-3d.png"                      alt="The player standing in front of a locked door on the browser FPS Wolfenstein 3D"                ></h2><p> Often called the grandfather of modern 3D shooters, Wolfenstein 3D is a monumental classic that all FPS fans need to play at some point. You play as an Allied spy who fights his way through Castle Wolfenstein, slaughtering Nazis and tracking down the Fuhrer himself for a final showdown. Despite the simplistic gameplay, it’s surprisingly fun and features charming old-school graphics.</p><p> The developers originally released the game for MS-DOS. However, Wolfenstein 3D is now available online for free and is considered one of the best retro browser shooter games. It is also worth noting that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-play-old-windows-dos-games-mac/" >you can play old DOS games on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so you may find the original version out there.</p><h2 id="4-Superhot"><a href="#4-Superhot" class="headerlink" title="4. Superhot "></a>4. Superhot <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/superhot-browser-fps.jpg"                      alt="The player shooting at an enemy in the browser FPS Superhot"                ></h2><p> You can play Superhot on your PC, Xbox One, or PS4, but it’s much easier to play the prototype from your browser. The prototype is the perfect way to try out the game in case you want to buy it, eventually. This FPS is unlike any other on this list—instead of the events around you happening in real-time, time only passes when you move, adding a tactical shooter game element to it.</p><p> You can use this to your advantage to dodge bullets and to buy some time to pick up a weapon. Your enemies come in the form of red people who shatter into pieces when you hit or shoot them. The browser-based version of Superhot doesn’t come with as many levels as the full game, but it’s still just as enjoyable.</p><h2 id="5-Krunker"><a href="#5-Krunker" class="headerlink" title="5. Krunker "></a>5. Krunker <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/krunker-browser-fps.jpg"                      alt="The player standing on a rooftop in the browser FPS Krunker"                ></h2><p> No matter how powerful of a computer you have, you can run Krunker. Which is what makes it such a great browser shooter. It uses Minecraft-like graphics that allow it to run on any type of computer (even ancient ones). You assume the role of a soldier who’s tasked with killing their enemies.</p><p> Krunker has 10 game modes you can choose from. One of the most popular modes includes<strong>Free For All</strong> , where the game pits you against other players, and the player with the most kills wins. You can also choose from several character classes, including a bullet-crazed<strong>Triggerman</strong> , a marksman<strong>Hunter</strong> , and a revolver-wielding<strong>Detective</strong> .</p><h2 id="6-War-Brokers"><a href="#6-War-Brokers" class="headerlink" title="6. War Brokers "></a>6. War Brokers <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/war-brokers-browser-fps.jpg"                      alt="The player standing in front of a Stop sign on the browser FPS War Brokers"                ></h2><p> War Brokers also uses blocky graphics, similar to Krunker. You can customize your character by editing your appearance and choosing your weapons. War Brokers offers plenty of variety when it comes to weapons—decide between a rifle, sniper, homing missile, mini-gun, and more. All of these options (including the chance to drive vehicles) make War Brokers one of the best browser FPS games you can play right now.</p><p> The game currently has two game modes:<strong>Classic</strong> and<strong>Battle</strong> <strong>Royale</strong> . Its<strong>Classic</strong> version comes with several game modes, including<strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> and<strong>Vehicle Escort</strong> , among others. If you’re a competitive PvP gamer you’ll feel right at home with this browser-based FPS.</p><h2 id="7-Venge"><a href="#7-Venge" class="headerlink" title="7. Venge "></a>7. Venge <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/venge-gunfight-browser-shooter.jpg"                      alt="A player vs player gunfight in the browser based FPS Venge"                ></h2><p> Venge is a much more comprehensive browser-based FPS game, incorporating abilities and class-based systems while prioritizing two versus two matchmaking which guarantees you won’t have to wait around too long for a game.</p><p> Venge has a leveling system that you can use to upgrade one of your characters’ abilities, adding further offensive powers to your game. To say that it doesn’t even require a download, Venge certainly offers a lot of content with mechanics that feel smooth and easy to play every session.</p><h2 id="8-Global-Strike"><a href="#8-Global-Strike" class="headerlink" title="8. Global Strike "></a>8. Global Strike <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/global-strike-browser-fps.jpg"                      alt="The player standing in front of mutated enemies on the browser FPS Global Strike"                ></h2><p> We know this FPS browser game for its fast-paced, highly-competitive multiplayer action. This is not the game to play if you want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/motion-sickness-playing-video-games/" >stop getting motion sickness when playing video games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as you have to have eyes in the back of your head on the game to be successful. Global Strike features several modes that keep the game from getting boring, for example,<strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> and<strong>Mutation</strong> .</p><p> Some players view Global Strike as a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-pay-to-win-in-video-games/" >pay-to-win game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It features a shop where you can buy permanent weapons, characters, and other accessories with real cash. As a result, certain players will buy the best weapons in the game with their own money.</p><p> This gives them a tremendous advantage over other players, and can definitely put a damper on the gameplay. It is also worth mentioning that there is a huge skill gap, in part because of the dedication of Global Strike’s community, so don’t be discouraged if you’re struggling in the early game.</p><h2 id="9-Kirka"><a href="#9-Kirka" class="headerlink" title="9. Kirka "></a>9. Kirka <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kirka-home-screen.jpg"                      alt="The Kirka home screen"                ></h2><p> Kirka is a fast-paced browser FPS game with a Minecraft art style. There are plenty of weapons for you to choose from as you battle it out with other players around the world. The high jumping mechanic as well as the dash mechanic ensures really fast gunfights and a learning curve.</p><p> Don’t be discouraged if you find that you struggle in your first few games. When you’re more familiar with the mechanics, you’ll find that you begin placing higher on the leaderboards. The game even offers different Quests to complete for in-game rewards, offering a continued experience you can play from any browser rather than a once-and-done type of game</p><h2 id="10-1v1-LOL"><a href="#10-1v1-LOL" class="headerlink" title="10. 1v1.LOL "></a>10. 1v1.LOL <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1v1lol-home-screen.jpg"                      alt="The homescreen of browser FPS game 1v1LOL"                ></h2><p> 1v1.LOL is a building sim, battle royale, and one of the best FPS browser games online, ideal if you’re a fan of Fortnite but can’t run it on your current device. You’ll find fast, responsive gameplay across a sizable map as you fight dozens of players from across the world.</p><p> 1v1.LOL even has a shop system where you can purchase cosmetic items for your character and weapons. You can invite friends to be on your team by creating a party and add friends that you meet on the game to play with later. It’s a fun, easy-to-run browser FPS game that you can play for hours at a time.</p><h2 id="Relive-Your-Youth-With-FPS-Browser-Games"><a href="#Relive-Your-Youth-With-FPS-Browser-Games" class="headerlink" title="Relive Your Youth With FPS Browser Games"></a>Relive Your Youth With FPS Browser Games</h2><p> You might remember playing FPS browser games when you got bored at school. The games you played as a kid might not exist anymore, but there are still plenty of browser shooter games worth checking out. Give one of the above games a try and relive your youth. Or go a step further by playing PC-based multiplayer games.</p><p> Browser shooters aren’t the only types of browser games that still exist. Instead, you could pass the time with cool browser-based puzzle games.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/your-ultimate-guide-to-todays-mmos-on-smartphones/"><u>Your Ultimate Guide to Today's MMOs on Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-future-in-your-hands-ifa-2023-displays/"><u>The Future in Your Hands - IFA 2023 Displays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/murder-minds-solved-engage-in-4-ai-driven-mysteries/"><u>Murder Minds Solved: Engage in 4 AI-Driven Mysteries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/maximizing-typing-speed-without-sacrificing-accuracy/"><u>Maximizing Typing Speed Without Sacrificing Accuracy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/wireless-playstation-controls-for-your-smartphone/"><u>Wireless PlayStation Controls for Your Smartphone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/maximize-game-performance-android-fps-testing-guide-2-techniques/"><u>Maximize Game Performance: Android FPS Testing Guide (2 Techniques)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/controlling-xbox-game-bars-activity-stream-on-windows-11/"><u>Controlling Xbox Game Bar's Activity Stream on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-hurdles-of-steams-wide-screen-display/"><u>Overcoming the Hurdles of Steam's Wide Screen Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-vivo-y100-5g-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Vivo Y100 5G Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-motorola-moto-g34-5gwithwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Motorola Moto G34 5Gwith/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/shake-the-sound-mobile-beats-best-ripplers-for-2024/"><u>Shake the Sound  Mobile Beats' Best Ripplers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-watch-hulu-outside-us-on-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Watch Hulu Outside US On Sony Xperia 1 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-motorola-moto-g13-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Motorola Moto G13 Lock Screen Clock in Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/speed-up-sound-on-smartphones-with-these/"><u>Speed Up Sound on Smartphones with These</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-from-jittery-to-smooth-video-stabilization-in-premiere-pro-made-easy-for-2024/"><u>Updated From Jittery to Smooth Video Stabilization in Premiere Pro Made Easy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Pattern Locks Are Unsafe Secure Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Phone Now with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-perfect-video-conferencing-the-essential-list-of-10-free-recorders/"><u>[New] Perfect Video Conferencing  The Essential List of 10 Free Recorders</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Interactive-Storytelling-at-Your-Fingertips"><a href="#Interactive-Storytelling-at-Your-Fingertips" class="headerlink" title="Interactive Storytelling at Your Fingertips"></a>Interactive Storytelling at Your Fingertips</h2><p> Text-based adventure games (also known as interactive fiction, or IF) are a classic game genre where all the interaction takes place through on-screen words. Despite their primitive origins born from hardware limitations, this type of adventure is still alive today and enjoyable on modern devices.</p><p> You don’t have to pay or install anything to play many text-based games. Instead, you can play them right now in your web browser. Here are some great text-adventure games available to play online.</p><h2 id="1-The-Dreamhold"><a href="#1-The-Dreamhold" class="headerlink" title="1. The Dreamhold "></a>1. The Dreamhold <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/The-Dreamhold-2022.png"                      alt="The Dreamhold Interactive Fiction Game"                ></h2><p> As it was specifically created for first-time interactive fiction players, The Dreamhold is an excellent way to get acquainted with this genre. Aside from its relatively short length and low difficulty, the game also features a “tutorial voice” that gives you hints throughout the experience.</p><p> If you’re not a novice, you can still enjoy The Dreamhold, though. Just type<strong>tutorial off</strong> to disable that part of the game. And if you’d like even more of a challenge, type<strong>expert</strong> to enter Expert mode, which makes some puzzles harder.</p><p> As for the game itself, the plot here revolves around you waking up inside a cell. You don’t remember how you got there and need to explore to figure it out.</p><h2 id="2-Zork"><a href="#2-Zork" class="headerlink" title="2. Zork "></a>2. Zork <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zork-Game-2022.png"                      alt="Zork Interactive Fiction Game"                ></h2><p> Zork is an early and well-known text adventure. Originally released in the late 1970s, it has survived the test of time due to its high quality of storytelling and advanced text recognition. For such an old game, the text parser is not particularly picky about what you enter.</p><p> As it turns out, Zork is actually split into three parts. This first one starts you in front of a white house with no further instructions. After working your way into the house, you’ll begin the adventure properly and need to collect as much treasure as you can.</p><p> Zork supports saving and restoring, and you can even change how much information the game gives you about new locations using the<strong>brief</strong> and<strong>verbose</strong> commands. This classic is a great starting point for getting into text adventure games. Give it a try to enjoy the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-adventure-games/" >origins of the adventure genre <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and see how long you can survive before you’re eaten by a grue.</p><h2 id="3-Spider-and-Web"><a href="#3-Spider-and-Web" class="headerlink" title="3. Spider and Web "></a>3. Spider and Web <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Spider-and-Web-2022.png"                      alt="Spider and Web Interactive Fiction Game"                ></h2><p> Spider and Web is a text-adventure game from 1998, created by the same person behind The Dreamhold. In this adventure, you’re a spy who was captured when masquerading as a tourist. You gradually figure out what’s going on at the same time your character does.</p><p> Notably, the dialogue options in this game are simple compared to others. When asked a question, you can only answer<strong>Yes</strong> ,<strong>No</strong> , or stay silent. This makes it easier to decide what you want to do, but that doesn’t mean the game is easy.</p><p> It’s often tough to keep track of what’s going on and keep your story straight, so expect a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-video-game-difficulty/" >high level of game difficulty <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can save and restore to avoid having to replay large chunks; the game also includes an<strong>Undo</strong> command for when you fail.</p><h2 id="4-Night-House"><a href="#4-Night-House" class="headerlink" title="4. Night House "></a>4. Night House <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Night-House-2022.png"                      alt="Night House Interactive Fiction Game"                ></h2><p> Are you in the mood for a spooky horror game? Night House has you play as a young boy who wakes up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. He soon discovers that his family isn’t home, and is thrust into a much scarier experience than he imagined.</p><p> Night House is unique in that it has a few extras aside from text input. The right side of the screen contains basic directional inputs that you can enter to move around. It also keeps track of your inventory and what’s around you. A simple map at the top of the screen helps you keep your bearings.</p><p> With extras like the sound effects of the ongoing thunderstorm, Night House adds a little extra to the text-adventure experience. Give it a try if the other games on the list were too rudimentary for you.</p><h2 id="5-Torn"><a href="#5-Torn" class="headerlink" title="5. Torn"></a>5. Torn</h2><p> Text-based games aren’t limited to interactive fiction. Torn is an online RPG with thousands of active players. In it, you start a life in a new city and decide the path you want to take. You could become strong, turn into a criminal, and beat up everyone else. Alternatively, study to become highly educated, follow the law, and run a successful company.</p><p> When you start, the game reminds you that it’s a long-term experience. This makes it a <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/addictive-short-web-games/" >great game for a quick session when you’re bored <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as you don’t need to sink tons of time into it at once.

You can extract the ISO file of a game you own using a PSP with custom firmware like <a class="link"   href="https://www.pspunk.com/" >pspunk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Go to PPSSPP’s App Store page and tap<strong>Get</strong> to download and install it on your iPhone.</li><li>Open the app and tap<strong>Load</strong> to select your ISO file.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ppsspp-ios-home-page.PNG"                      alt="PPSSPP iOS Home Page"                ></li><li>Navigate to the directory where you stored your ISO file and tap on it to launch the game. You can play the game using the on-screen controls, but I strongly recommend <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-connect-ps5-controller-to-phone/" >connecting a controller to your iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a better experience.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ppsspp-loading-an-iso-file-via-the-files-app.PNG"                      alt="PPSSPP loading an ISO file via the Files app"                ></li></ol><p> If you have an older iPhone, like an iPhone Xs, and you’re trying to play more demanding games, you may experience stuttering and low frame rate. To improve performance, you can lower the resolution by tapping<strong>Settings &gt; Graphics</strong> and setting<strong>Rendering Resolution</strong> to<strong>1 x PSP</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ppsspp-ios-settings-menu.PNG"                      alt="PPSSPP iOS Settings Menu"                ></p><p> Console emulation has completely changed gaming on iPhones, and quite frankly, I prefer it over traditional mobile games. It’s a fantastic way to play amazing games without any ads or microtransactions.</p><p> I’ve been playing Assassin’s Creed: Bloodlines using PPSSPP recently, but I also strongly recommend other titles like God of War: Ghost of Sparta or Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, which are excellent games from major AAA studios.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/addressing-steam-operational-hurdles-in-windows-11/"><u>Addressing Steam Operational Hurdles in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ignite-your-gaming-experience-with-a-comprehensive-4k-configuration-on-xbox-sx/"><u>Ignite Your Gaming Experience with a Comprehensive 4K Configuration on Xbox SX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/classic-consoles-reimagined-with-a-futuristic-twist/"><u>Classic Consoles Reimagined with a Futuristic Twist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/navigating-the-advanced-features-of-amds-rx-7800xt-7700xt/"><u>Navigating the Advanced Features of AMD's RX 7800XT, 7700XT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/silent-strategy-avoiding-mics-on-ps5-controller/"><u>Silent Strategy: Avoiding Mics on PS5 Controller</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/crucial-5-motivations-why-purchase-vintage-gaming-units/"><u>Crucial 5 Motivations: Why Purchase Vintage Gaming Units</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/streamline-your-cinema-experience-on-ps5/"><u>Streamline Your Cinema Experience on PS5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-birthplace-of-foddian-game-titles/"><u>The Birthplace of Foddian Game Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-transforming-webp-images-into-jpegs-effortlessly/"><u>[New] Transforming WebP Images Into JPEGs Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/unleash-the-power-of-engaging-headline-crafting-for-2024/"><u>Unleash the Power of Engaging Headline Crafting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-apple-iphone-13-devices-entirely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/"><u>Guide on How To Erase Apple iPhone 13 Devices Entirely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-nokia-g42-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Nokia G42 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-tecno-phantom-v-flip-location-without-installing-software-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Tecno Phantom V Flip Location without Installing Software? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-eye-catching-tiktok-personalities-30-pfp-strategies/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Eye-Catching TikTok Personalities  30 PFP Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-your-instagrams-video-popularity-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Your Instagram's Video Popularity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-music-from-oppo-f25-pro-5g-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Music from Oppo F25 Pro 5G to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/online-screenshots-and-screen-recorders-guide-for-2024/"><u>Online Screenshots & Screen Recorders Guide for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="13-Fun-Games-to-Improve-Your-Creative-Design-Skills"><a href="#13-Fun-Games-to-Improve-Your-Creative-Design-Skills" class="headerlink" title="13 Fun Games to Improve Your Creative Design Skills"></a>13 Fun Games to Improve Your Creative Design Skills</h2><p> You might believe that playing games will make you lazy, or that it’s a bad idea to play games instead of being productive. But you can play games while being productive.</p><p> We’ve provided a list of 13 fun games you can play that will help improve your creative design skills. Some will make you a better graphic designer or illustrator, and some allow you to identify design elements with more accuracy. You can have fun playing and improving your creative design skills.</p><h2 id="1-Color"><a href="#1-Color" class="headerlink" title="1. Color "></a>1. Color <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/color-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Color design game."                ></h2><p> The Color game is a great way for you to learn color harmony while having fun. The most stressful part of this game is learning linguistic terms for different color pairings while simultaneously under the clock.</p><p>The game presents a gradient color wheel. There are six rounds:</p><ul><li>Hue</li><li>Saturation</li><li>Complementary</li><li>Analogous</li><li>Triadic</li><li>Tetradic</li></ul><p> If you already know all six terms, you’ve got a great head start.</p><p> Depending on the round, you’ll complete a circle of color with a new color based on the round name. You’re against the clock, but there’s plenty of time. There’s a calm, meditative feeling when you get the color matched correctly.</p><h2 id="2-Pixactly"><a href="#2-Pixactly" class="headerlink" title="2. Pixactly "></a>2. Pixactly <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pixactly-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Pixactly design game."                ></h2><p> Pixactly is a great game for pixel perfectionists. If you think you can estimate pixel sizes, now’s your time to test yourself.</p><p> This pixel-based game presents a dimension, and you have to draw a box to that size blindly. There’s no grid or rulers to help. You’ll draw based on experience in the pixel-centric digital world.</p><p> It’s a crushing reality to draw a box and find you were off by over 50px. Back to the drawing board for more practice.</p><h2 id="3-I-Love-Hue"><a href="#3-I-Love-Hue" class="headerlink" title="3. I Love Hue "></a>3. I Love Hue <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/i-love-hue-001.jpg"                      alt="I Love Hue app start page."                ></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/i-love-hue-002.jpg"                      alt="I Love Hue app game screen."                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/i-love-hue-003.jpg"                      alt="I Love Hue app game screen."                ></p><p>Close</p><p> This gentle color-matching game offers colored tiles you have to place in the correct location to complete the gradient. A simple game for your eye’s perception of color. You can play on both iOS or Android as a relaxing way to spend time.</p><p> The game developers even released a sequel for I Love Hue called I Love Hue Too. Both games are fun and simple ways to test your color perception.</p><h2 id="4-Can’t-Unsee"><a href="#4-Can’t-Unsee" class="headerlink" title="4. Can’t Unsee "></a>4. Can’t Unsee <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cant-unsee-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Can&#39;t Unsee design game."                ></h2><p> This is the design game for perfectionists. Can’t Unsee presents two UX&#x2F;UI designs, and you must select which one is wrong.</p><p> When it comes to UX&#x2F;UI design, there are standards to be followed, such as using colors to represent global standards—like red being negative or green being positive—and layouts like hierarchal text.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/grayscale-ui-ux-design-benefits/" >Designing in grayscale is a great process for UX&#x2F;UI designers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but when it’s time for color and other elements, this game will help too.</p><p> This game is helpful for those new to UX&#x2F;UI design. Once you’ve mastered the do’s and don’ts of interface design, you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ui-ux-designer-skills-you-should-master/" >master some other technical skills of UX&#x2F;UI designers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Kolor"><a href="#5-Kolor" class="headerlink" title="5. Kolor "></a>5. Kolor <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kolor-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Kolor design game."                ></h2><p> Kolor is another great color-matching game. It’s a simple premise: match the color to one of the options.</p><p> This game is scored and timed, and with every few rounds, it increases in difficulty. If you’ve got a good eye for color, you’ll enjoy this game and score highly.</p><h2 id="6-It’s-Centred-That"><a href="#6-It’s-Centred-That" class="headerlink" title="6. It’s Centred That "></a>6. It’s Centred That <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/its-centered-that-001.jpg"                      alt="It&#39;s Centred That design game screen."                ></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/its-centered-that-002.jpg"                      alt="It&#39;s Centred That design game screen."                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/its-centered-that-003.jpg"                      alt="It&#39;s Centred That design game screen."                ></p><p>Close</p><p> While there are plenty of design shortcuts to help you center elements in place, having a good eye for balance will help. It’s Centred That is an app that tests your designer’s eye.</p><p> In ten levels, you’ll be asked if a black dot is central to the shape on which it’s placed. Select the happy emoji if you think it is or the poop emoji if you think it isn’t. Keep going through the rounds and find your results. It’s a great practice for eye measurements in design.</p><h2 id="7-Hex-Invaders"><a href="#7-Hex-Invaders" class="headerlink" title="7. Hex Invaders "></a>7. Hex Invaders <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hex-invaders-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Hex Invaders design game."                ></h2><p> Another great color game, Hex Invaders helps you identify color combinations by their HEX codes. The HEX code is a 6-digit code that uses letters and numbers to represent the levels of Red, Green, and Blue—RGB—that make up any screen color.</p><p> Hex Invaders is reminiscent of arcade games from the past. It’s easy to play and helps you recognize HEX codes quickly and with more understanding than just copying and pasting them in Adobe Illustrator.</p><h2 id="8-Font-Memory-Game"><a href="#8-Font-Memory-Game" class="headerlink" title="8. Font Memory Game "></a>8. Font Memory Game <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/font-memory-game-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Font Memory Game screen."                ></h2><p> It’s everybody’s favorite card game—Snap—for typography enthusiasts. This game tests not only your creative knowledge of font recognition, but also your memory.</p><p> Flip each card presenting a typographic example and match it with its partner. This game is low-stakes and a reminder to use some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-adult-memory-game-apps/" >games or apps to improve your memory <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your spare time, too.</p><h2 id="9-The-Bezier-Game"><a href="#9-The-Bezier-Game" class="headerlink" title="9. The Bézier Game "></a>9. The Bézier Game <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bezier-design-game.jpg"                      alt="The Bezier Game design game screen."                ></h2><p> If you draw with the Bézier tool in Illustrator or other software, you’ll know that the best drawings use the least amount of nodes and steps. The Bézier Game is a fun game to test your Bézier skills.</p><p> The game provides a shape outline and a number of nodes. You must use the Bézier tool to draw the outline in as many nodes as have been provided. You can’t use more. This game will test your skills and sanity as you improve your Bézier drawing technique. Once you’ve mastered the Bézier tool, take your skills to Adobe Illustrator and learn <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/illustrator-how-to-scale-strokes-proportionally/" >how to scale your stroke widths <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too.</p><h2 id="10-Figma-Ninja"><a href="#10-Figma-Ninja" class="headerlink" title="10. Figma Ninja "></a>10. Figma Ninja <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/figma-ninja-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Figma Ninja design game in Figma."                ></h2><p> This game is most interesting because it isn’t programmed like a game. There’s no animation or automation. Figma Ninja is an open Figma file where each page is a game screen; it has instructions on the pages, and you move through each page yourself.</p><p> The aim of Figma Ninja is to improve your Figma skills and shortcut knowledge. There’s no scoring system or incorrect buzzer when you make a mistake. It’s a self-improvement game.</p><p> Figma Ninja has turned design into a game while retaining the background of a design program. Read our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-figma-beginners-guide/" >beginner’s guide to Figma <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want a level playing field before playing.</p><h2 id="11-Kerntype"><a href="#11-Kerntype" class="headerlink" title="11. Kerntype "></a>11. Kerntype <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kerntype-design-game.jpg"                      alt="Kerntype design game."                ></h2><p> Kerning is an important aspect of graphic design. Think you know about correct letter spacing? Kerntype is a fun and helpful game to train your eye for better letter spacing.</p><p> The two outer letters are locked in place, and the aim of the game is to move any middle letters left or right until they are correctly set. A blue outline will show the correct placement, and you’ll be given a percentage of how close you were.</p><h2 id="12-What-the-Hex"><a href="#12-What-the-Hex" class="headerlink" title="12. What the Hex?"></a>12. What the Hex?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/what-the-hex-design-game.jpg"                      alt="What The Hex? Design game screen."                ></p><p> You can pair the knowledge gained from playing Hex Invaders with this color-matching game. What the Hex? Presents a HEX code and five color swatches. Your job is to find which color is represented in the HEX.</p><p> It’s a low-stakes game with no points system or timer. You can get as many wrong as there are available, but it’s better for your creative design skills to think about the HEX code and what each part means for colors.</p><h2 id="13-Dudel-Draw"><a href="#13-Dudel-Draw" class="headerlink" title="13.

By purchasing a paid game, you can avoid the need for microtransactions and save money in the long run.</li><li>Paid mobile games generally have higher overall quality compared to free ones, with stunning graphics, good dialogue, creative storytelling, and overall polish.</li><li>Buying mobile games supports and benefits both small indie developers and larger game developer teams, allowing them to continue developing new games.</li><li>5. Paid games tend to have better long-term developer support, with consistent updates, bug fixes, and improvements, while support for free-to-play games is mostly limited to big, popular titles.</li></ul><p> There are millions of games on the App Store and Play Store, many of which are free. It’s those free-to-play games that most of us opt for—after all, why buy a game when there are lots of free options to choose from?</p><p> Consider the saying, “The best things in life are free.” This may be true in some instances, but not necessarily when it comes to mobile games.</p><p> Paid mobile games have several advantages over free ones, making for a better mobile gaming experience. Here are five reasons to buy mobile games instead of playing them for free.</p><h2 id="1-Enjoy-an-Ad-Free-Experience"><a href="#1-Enjoy-an-Ad-Free-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. Enjoy an Ad-Free Experience "></a>1. Enjoy an Ad-Free Experience <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/turned-on-iphone-displaying-pokemon-go-charizard-application.jpg"                      alt="turned on iphone displaying pokemon go charizard application"                ></h2><p> Ads are annoying and intrusive, detracting from your mobile gaming experience. And if you’re playing a free-to-play mobile game, you’ll definitely encounter ads.</p><p> Of course, you can try one or two things to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-trick-disable-ads-mobile-games/" >disable mobile game ads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For instance, you can put your phone in airplane mode, but this isn’t without its issues. What if the game you’re playing requires an internet connection? Or what if enabling airplane mode doesn’t work?</p><p> That’s why, for the best ad-free experience, you should download a paid game instead of a free-to-play one. By the way, in case you’re wondering why we’re using free-to-play instead of free in this article, it’s because there’s a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-games-vs-free-to-play-games/" >difference between free and free-to-play games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Avoid-Making-In-App-Purchases"><a href="#2-Avoid-Making-In-App-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoid Making In-App Purchases "></a>2. Avoid Making In-App Purchases <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-man-holding-a-phone-and-a-credit-card.jpg"                      alt="A man holding a phone and a credit card"                ></h2><p> In-app purchases, or IAPs, are a thorn in the side of every mobile gamer who plays free-to-play games. Often, you’ll find that you can’t progress quickly or access special in-game items without paying.</p><p> Without IAPs, you’ll spend twice as long to complete tasks and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/grinding-video-games/" >grinding through the game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to achieve goals. If you’re playing a competitive game, you’ll be at a disadvantage compared to players who do spend on in-app purchases.</p><p> Even when you’re not competing against other players, there can be restrictions like limited time to use an item, waiting for tickets to recharge, being unable to unlock certain chapters, and so much more.</p><p> To avoid all the above, you might end up either giving up on the game or making microtransactions. The problem with microtransactions is that they can add up until you end up spending much more than if you’d purchased the game.</p><p> We know free <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mobile-games-microtransactions-reasons-why/" >mobile games have microtransactions for a reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but they can be excessive and ruin the mobile gaming experience.</p><p> In the end, if you’re going to spend money on IAPs, why not make a one-time purchase instead and save your money in the long run?</p><h2 id="3-Paid-Mobile-Games-Are-Higher-Quality"><a href="#3-Paid-Mobile-Games-Are-Higher-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Paid Mobile Games Are Higher Quality"></a>3. Paid Mobile Games Are Higher Quality</h2><p> We don’t mean that free-to-play games are poor in quality. On the contrary, there are many <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mobile-games-you-can-enjoy-without-paying/" >great free-to-play mobile games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can enjoy. However, when it comes to overall quality, paid games are better.</p><p> Compare free-to-play and paid games on any app store. Free-to-play games are numerous, and you’re bound to find twice as many low-quality ones, while paid games are fewer and mostly high-quality; this is because, with paid games, developers put in a lot of effort so they can recoup what they spent during development.</p><p> If a developer were to make a low-quality game, no one would want to pay for it, which would mean a substantial financial loss.</p><p> So, if you’re looking for games with stunning graphics, good dialogue, creative storytelling, and all-around polish, check the paid games section of the App Store or Play Store.</p><h2 id="4-Support-Mobile-Game-Developers"><a href="#4-Support-Mobile-Game-Developers" class="headerlink" title="4. Support Mobile Game Developers "></a>4. Support Mobile Game Developers <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/people-sitting-at-a-table-with-computers-on-it.jpg"                      alt="People sitting at a table with computers on it"                ></h2><p> One of the best ways to give back to any industry is by supporting it financially, which also applies to the mobile gaming industry. Buying mobile games is one way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/support-game-developers-without-microtransactions/" >support mobile game developers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , particularly smaller indie ones.</p><p> Small developer teams and solo developers don’t have as much exposure or resources as larger ones, so they tend to struggle with making a profit. When you buy their games, you’re enabling them to continue to develop new ones. As an extra step, you can buy directly from their website, so all the revenue goes to them.</p><p> Even large game developer teams benefit from people purchasing their games. After all, if no one’s doing so, that’s a large chunk of revenue down the drain. If you can afford it, purchase paid mobile games to support mobile game developers, big and small.</p><h2 id="5-Paid-Games-Have-Better-Long-Term-Developer-Support"><a href="#5-Paid-Games-Have-Better-Long-Term-Developer-Support" class="headerlink" title="5.

While free-to-play games enjoy developer support, they are mostly limited to big, popular titles.</p><p> With paid games, developers will likely offer phone, email, or chat support. Paid games also receive more support from developers through consistent updates, bug fixes, and other improvements.</p><h2 id="Purchase-Mobile-Games-Instead-of-Playing-for-Free"><a href="#Purchase-Mobile-Games-Instead-of-Playing-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Purchase Mobile Games Instead of Playing for Free"></a>Purchase Mobile Games Instead of Playing for Free</h2><p> There are several reasons to purchase games instead of playing for free. You don’t have to deal with pesky ads, nor do you need to make microtransactions to progress or enjoy access to certain features.</p><p> Paid games are typically of higher quality and receive more support from developers. And when you buy games, you ensure that game developers can keep making new games.</p><p> If you want a perfect mobile gaming experience, buying a game is the way to go.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-art-of-curating-ps5-gaming-membership-benefits/"><u>The Art of Curating PS5 Gaming Membership Benefits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/adapting-to-change-how-steams-ai-rules-transform-gaming/"><u>Adapting to Change: How Steam's AI Rules Transform Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-fixing-roblox-error-code-403-on-windows-systems/"><u>Mastering the Art of Fixing Roblox Error Code 403 on Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-combining-sony-and-switch-gameplay/"><u>Master the Art of Combining Sony & Switch Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/boosting-boldness-masterful-frame-rate-strategies/"><u>Boosting Boldness: Masterful Frame Rate Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/cut-out-console-noise-with-ease-on-xbox/"><u>Cut Out Console Noise with Ease on Xbox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steam-vs-gog-consumer-benefits-explored-in-depth/"><u>Steam vs GOG: Consumer Benefits Explored in Depth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-10-ultra-hd-capable-gaming-devices/"><u>Top 10 Ultra HD Capable Gaming Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-the-compre-written-documentation-and-examples-for-recording-sims-4-games-in-a-way-that-is-clear-concise-and-easy-to-understand-with-each-new-title-conve/"><u>[New] The Compre Written Documentation and Examples for Recording Sims 4 Games in a Way that Is Clear, Concise, and Easy to Understand, with Each New Title Conveying Similar Meanings While Adhering to the Maximum Character Limit of 156 Characters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/cut-to-the-chase-managing-twitch-streams-for-2024/"><u>Cut to the Chase  Managing Twitch Streams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/visual-verdict-clash-sj6-prodigy-versus-yis-4k-masterpiece/"><u>Visual Verdict Clash  SJ6 Prodigy Versus Yi’s 4K Masterpiece</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/super-easy-ways-to-deal-with-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-unresponsive-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Super Easy Ways To Deal with Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ Unresponsive Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-complete-guide-to-360-video-submission-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Complete Guide to 360 Video Submission on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-vivo-y36i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Vivo Y36i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-10-best-portable-dvd-player/"><u>[New] 10 Best Portable DVD Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tonal-transition-triumphs-for-creative-virtuosos/"><u>2024 Approved  Tonal Transition Triumphs for Creative Virtuosos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplified-methods-to-close-unused-social-media-linkedin-account/"><u>In 2024, Simplified Methods to Close Unused Social Media (LinkedIn) Account</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Or maybe you are a person who does a little bit of everything and is looking for a more general-purpose monitor.</p><p> Spending some time thinking of what you’ll primarily use the monitor for will guide you toward the right features and specifications your monitor should have.</p><h2 id="2-Getting-the-Wrong-Sized-Monitor-for-Your-Room"><a href="#2-Getting-the-Wrong-Sized-Monitor-for-Your-Room" class="headerlink" title="2 Getting the Wrong-Sized Monitor for Your Room "></a>2 Getting the Wrong-Sized Monitor for Your Room <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/valorant-game-running-on-an-oled-monitor-mounted-on-a-desk-with-keyboard-and-mouse-below.jpg"                      alt="Valorant game running on an OLED monitor mounted on a desk with keyboard and mouse below"                ></h2><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Size matters when it comes to monitors, but bigger isn’t always better. Before settling on a screen size, consider the dimensions of your room or workspace. Different screen sizes will require different spacing between you and the monitor.</p><p> The bigger the monitor, the farther you’ll need to sit to view the entire screen comfortably. In contrast, the smaller the screen size, the nearer you’ll have to be so as not to strain your eyes. It’s easier to get a properly sized monitor for your room than to find a room that fits your monitor.</p><p> Take measurements and ensure the monitor fits comfortably in your environment.</p><h2 id="3-Forgetting-About-Ports"><a href="#3-Forgetting-About-Ports" class="headerlink" title="3 Forgetting About Ports "></a>3 Forgetting About Ports <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/muo-gaming-wii-tv-connection-av-hdmi-2023-3.jpg"                      alt="TV HDMI ports"                ></h2><p> Ports are often overlooked but are essential for connectivity. Consider what devices you’ll connect to your monitor and ensure it has the necessary ports. Having the wrong ports on your monitor can cause performance issues—or worse, it won’t even work for your system.</p><p> For example, using <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/hdmi-vs-display-port-best-for-gaming/" >HDMI over DisplayPort for gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on an Nvidia gaming system because your monitor doesn’t have DisplayPort can lower gaming performance due to the lack of G-Sync support.</p><p> You may also want to think about future-proofing your setup by choosing a monitor with versatile ports that can accommodate system upgrades you plan to have in the future.</p><h2 id="4-Choosing-the-Wrong-Screen-Resolution"><a href="#4-Choosing-the-Wrong-Screen-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="4 Choosing the Wrong Screen Resolution"></a>4 Choosing the Wrong Screen Resolution</h2><p> While a larger screen can provide a more immersive experience, the resolution determines the clarity of the display. Don’t assume that a bigger screen automatically means a higher resolution. Consider the resolution that best suits your usage and ensures sharp image quality.</p><p> Of course, you don’t always have to have high resolutions for larger monitors. For example, programmers likely won’t have a problem using a 1080p ultrawide monitor so long as they can program and read the documentation.</p><h2 id="5-Focusing-Solely-on-Price"><a href="#5-Focusing-Solely-on-Price" class="headerlink" title="5 Focusing Solely on Price"></a>5 Focusing Solely on Price</h2><p> While budget constraints are understandable, focusing solely on price can lead to overlooking crucial features and sacrificing quality. Keep in mind that a cheaper monitor may cost you more in the long run if it lacks the features you need or has poor build quality.</p><p> Sometimes, a less expensive monitor might be a better fit for you. Sometimes, you don’t need all the extra features that more expensive monitors have. In fact, some features may be something you’ll want to avoid. For example, a cheaper QLED panel is better than a more expensive OLED in a place with lots of natural lighting.</p><p> Strike a balance between price and value to ensure you get the best bang for your buck.</p><h2 id="6-Failing-to-Understand-Common-Monitor-Specifications"><a href="#6-Failing-to-Understand-Common-Monitor-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="6 Failing to Understand Common Monitor Specifications"></a>6 Failing to Understand Common Monitor Specifications</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/commonly-confused-monitor-specs/" >Understanding common monitor specifications <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> such as refresh rate, response time, and brightness is crucial for making an informed decision. These factors can significantly impact your viewing experience, especially if you’re a gamer or professional requiring precise color accuracy. Take the time to research and understand what each specification means for your usage.</p><h2 id="7-Falling-for-Marketing-Gimmicks"><a href="#7-Falling-for-Marketing-Gimmicks" class="headerlink" title="7 Falling for Marketing Gimmicks"></a>7 Falling for Marketing Gimmicks</h2><p> Don’t be swayed by flashy marketing gimmicks that add little to no value to your overall experience. Integrated speakers, RGB lighting, or fancy labels may seem enticing, but they often come at the expense of essential features or performance. Focus on functionality over aesthetics to ensure you get a monitor that meets your needs.</p><p> It’s not bad to have fancy lighting on your monitor, especially if you really like it. As long as you’ve set your budget and prioritized your needs first, getting the extras shouldn’t be a problem afterward.</p><h2 id="8-Ignoring-Ergonomic-Features"><a href="#8-Ignoring-Ergonomic-Features" class="headerlink" title="8 Ignoring Ergonomic Features"></a>8 Ignoring Ergonomic Features</h2><p> Ergonomic features play a significant role in ensuring comfort during extended use. Look for monitors with adjustable stands, tilt, swivel, and height options to customize your viewing experience.</p><p> Additionally, even if you’re currently fine with the stock monitor stand, consider whether it supports <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-vesa-mounting-standards/#:~:text=One%20such%20standard%20is%20the,fit%20across%20different%20display%20mounts." >VESA mounting and what VESA standard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it uses. Having the option to VESA mount your monitor will ensure more flexible setups that may interest you in the future.</p><h2 id="9-Not-Checking-Reviews-and-User-Feedback"><a href="#9-Not-Checking-Reviews-and-User-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="9 Not Checking Reviews and User Feedback"></a>9 Not Checking Reviews and User Feedback</h2><p> Before purchasing, read reviews and user feedback to get a sense of real-world experiences. Pay attention to both positive and negative reviews to gauge the monitor’s strengths and weaknesses. This will help you make a more informed decision and avoid potential pitfalls.</p><h2 id="10-Not-Checking-for-Warranty-and-Support"><a href="#10-Not-Checking-for-Warranty-and-Support" class="headerlink" title="10 Not Checking for Warranty and Support"></a>10 Not Checking for Warranty and Support</h2><p> Finally, don’t overlook the importance of warranty and support when purchasing a monitor. Even the most reputable brands can encounter issues, so having reliable warranty coverage and access to timely support can save you from headaches down the line. Prioritize monitors with robust warranty options and reputable customer service.</p><p> When possible, you’ll want to have both a manufacturer’s warranty and a store warranty. If you can only have a warranty from the manufacturer, make sure that the store you buy your monitor from is an official distributor of that manufacturer.</p><p> Additionally, buying a monitor from a physical store near you may actually be better than buying a slightly discounted one online. Often, visiting a physical store to return or service your monitor is less of a hassle than shipping your monitor to an online store, which may take significantly longer to process.</p><p> By avoiding these common mistakes and taking the time to research and evaluate your options, you can ensure that you end up with a monitor that meets your needs and provides an enjoyable viewing experience for years to come.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/superior-selection-of-16-joint-play-console-games/"><u>Superior Selection of 16 Joint Play Console Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-value-picks-identifying-the-most-affordable-video-game-sites/"><u>Top Value Picks: Identifying the Most Affordable Video Game Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mending-the-inconsistencies-of-steams-data-exchange/"><u>Mending the Inconsistencies of Steam's Data Exchange</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/playstation-5-controller-for-pc-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>PlayStation 5 Controller for PC: A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/correcting-minecraft-launcher-malfunction-code-0x803f8001/"><u>Correcting Minecraft Launcher Malfunction: Code 0X803F8001</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/predicting-pc-gamings-leaders-is-it-apple/"><u>Predicting PC Gaming's Leaders – Is It Apple?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/whats-new-nvidias-integration-of-ai-into-dlss-35/"><u>What's New: Nvidia's Integration of AI Into DLSS 3.5?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-budget-planning-for-music-video-production/"><u>[Updated] Budget Planning for Music Video Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-background-music-compilations/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Background Music Compilations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-wiped-videos-on-htc-u23-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>How to restore wiped videos on HTC U23 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/best-10-mock-location-apps-worth-trying-on-samsung-galaxy-f14-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best 10 Mock Location Apps Worth Trying On Samsung Galaxy F14 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-3-best-ipad-voice-memo-and-capture-software/"><u>[New] In 2024, 3 Best iPad Voice Memo and Capture Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/high-quality-fb-videos-for-ff-browser-users/"><u>High-Quality FB Videos for FF Browser Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfect-your-images-with-dynamic-text-tools/"><u>In 2024, Perfect Your Images with Dynamic Text Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Sony Xperia 1 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-itel-a60-phone-without-any-data-loss-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Itel A60 Phone without Any Data Loss</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Very hot, in fact. Some of the more demanding titles can ask a lot in terms of performance, which can, in turn, cause rapid spikes in temperature and potential long-term damage.</p><p> While built-in vents at the back of the console offer some assistance with heat dissipation, you can rapidly accelerate the cooldown by investing in a Steam Deck cooling fan to attach to your console. There are docking stations with built-in fans, dual-cooling fans that clip onto your Steam Deck, and magnetic options, depending on your preference.</p><p>Here are the best cooling accessories and gadgets for the Steam Deck.</p><ul><li><a class="link"

Simply connect the dock to your TV with an HDMI cable, and the dock’s power adaptor to your Steam Deck’s USB port, and you’re ready to play on the big screen.</p><p> When docked, the built-in steam deck cooler fan will blast cool air across the back of your console, reducing the build-up of heat while it’s docked and&#x2F;or in use. This docking station is equipped with heat dissipating vents as well, which act to further reduce the heat from the console and can help to prolong its life.</p><p> An anti-slip bottom keeps this cooling docking station firmly rooted to the spot and stops it from tipping over.

This magnetic cooling fan offers two cooling modes: normal and extremely cold. However, we advise caution on using extremely cold mode for long periods to avoid any potential condensation build-up, as it works against the Steam Deck’s heat output.</p><p> Thanks to the semiconductor heatsink radiator noise-reduction design, the sound output from this cooling fan is lower than 24dB, so fan noise shouldn’t impair your gameplay. Steam Deck temperature can be reduced from around 54 degrees to four degrees centigrade, and there’s an LED temperature display for you to keep tabs on things.</p><p> RGB lights add a cool lighting effect, though it’s entirely down to personal preference whether you like the feature, as it cannot be switched off. Equally effective as an attachable cooling unit for a laptop or iPad, you’ll find this a versatile option worthy of consideration as a Steam Deck fan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/medirone-docking-station.jpg"                      alt="Medirone Docking Station"                ></p><p>Best Value</p><h5 id="MEDIRONE-Docking-Station-for-Steam-Deck-1"><a href="#MEDIRONE-Docking-Station-for-Steam-Deck-1" class="headerlink" title="MEDIRONE Docking Station for Steam Deck"></a>MEDIRONE Docking Station for Steam Deck</h5><p>More docking options than a spaceport</p><p> The MEDIRONE Docking Station for Steam Deck is a six-in-one docking station with dual cooling fans, to keep things chilled as you play.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Allows for Steam Deck gameplay on your TV</li><li>Dock multiple devices, such as a gaming mouse or keyboard</li><li>Fans work in addition to the Steam Deck’s air vent</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Fans are on the noisy side</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLH6BW4X?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018376&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/cooling-accessories-steam-deck/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.newegg.com/p/2RC-008W-000E9" >$73 at Newegg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The MEDIRONE Docking Station for Stream Deck is equipped with a cooling fan and offers a six-in-one docking solution. This includes an HDMI 2.0 4K output, three USB-A 3.0 ports, a 100W speed charging USB-C port, plus a Gigabit Ethernet input.</p><p> A connective cable on the docking station attaches to your Steam Deck via the Type-C input, and you’re ready to go. The station features two cooling fans (one of which is situated near the Steam Deck’s air vent while docked), that act to dissipate the heat that is produced. Non-slip silicone pads ensure your Steam Deck stays put in its cradle, and anti-skid feet help prevent any sliding on tabletops.</p><p> By MEDIRONE’s own admission, this device cannot completely reduce the heat output from your Steam Deck. However, by providing additional heat dissipation, it definitely helps matters. And if you want a decent docking station that allows for big screen gaming, then this provides the means for those gaming sessions to last a bit longer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jsaux-modcase.jpg"                      alt="JSAUX ModCase"                ></p><p>Best for Protection</p><h5 id="JSAUX-ModCase-for-Steam-Deck-1"><a href="#JSAUX-ModCase-for-Steam-Deck-1" class="headerlink" title="JSAUX ModCase for Steam Deck"></a>JSAUX ModCase for Steam Deck</h5><p> A silicone-based bodyguard for your Steam Deck</p><p> Protect your Steam Deck on the move, and keep it cool and collected for gameplay, with the JSAUX ModCase for Steam Deck.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Offers plenty of protection for your Steam Deck</li><li>Can cool your console by up to 20 percent</li><li>Precision cut casing</li><li>Modular slider allows extra compatible accessories to be attached</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-ModCase-PC0104-Accessories-Protective/dp/B0BY2G5V4Z?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018376&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/cooling-accessories-steam-deck/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$50 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Consisting of a protective back case with metal stand, a protective front cover, and cooling fan, the JSAUX ModCase for Steam Deck not only makes your console more transportable but offers a cool way to stop it overheating while in use.</p><p> The modular case is precision cut to fit the Steam Deck’s dimensions and made from eco-friendly PC-ABS and silicone. The underside of the screen cover is lined with soft EVA cotton to protect the screen from scratch damage, and TPU wrap along the edges of the case provides drop and shock protection.</p><p> The fan itself attaches to the back of the Steam Deck (the protective case will need to be removed first to do so). It acts to increase the airflow produced by the Steam Deck’s vents, to reduce the built up of heat on the unit itself. In this way, it can cool down the Steam Deck by up to 20 percent. This quality case and cooling fan don’t come cheap, but they do offer Steam Deck users an effective means to kill two birds with one stone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/black-shark-magnetic-cooler.jpg"                      alt="Black Shark Magnetic Cooler"                ></p><p>Best for Multiple Devices</p><h5 id="Black-Shark-Magnetic-Cooler-1"><a href="#Black-Shark-Magnetic-Cooler-1" class="headerlink" title="Black Shark Magnetic Cooler"></a>Black Shark Magnetic Cooler</h5><p> Highly attractive magnetic cooler for Steam Deck</p><p> Not only is the Black Shark Magnetic Cooler ideal for keeping your Steam Deck nice and cool, but it also works on your other devices, too.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Versatile; works with multiple devices</li><li>Effective for cooling</li><li>Quiet operation</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Needs to be plugged in to work</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Black-Shark-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B09CGTLDB7?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018376&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/cooling-accessories-steam-deck/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$40 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> There’s no denying the convenience of this snap-lock magnetic cooler from Black Shark. At just 73 grams, it’s super lightweight and eminently transportable. But it also packs a wallop where it needs to, by reducing your device’s temperature by 23 degrees. And while safe and effective for Steam Deck users, it can also be used for mobiles, laptops, and tablets.</p><p> It features five blades which rotate at speeds of up to 7,200 RPM. Constructed with a strong magnetic ring at its center, made from 15 NdFeB magnets, it boasts a much more solid attachment than other magnetic coolers.</p><p> It comes with a USB Type-C cable, and unfortunately, since the cooler itself has no internal battery, it will need to be connected to a power source during use. However, as rechargeable coolers tend to suffer from a build-up of heat themselves, you might feel this works in its favor. Regardless, it looks cool and is cool. It will keep your Steam Deck perfectly chilled, so long as you don’t mind plugging it in first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yigorn-fan.jpg"                      alt="Yigorn fan"                ></p><p>Best RGB Option</p><h5 id="Yigorn-Steam-Deck-Dock-Cooler-1"><a href="#Yigorn-Steam-Deck-Dock-Cooler-1" class="headerlink" title="Yigorn Steam Deck Dock Cooler"></a>Yigorn Steam Deck Dock Cooler</h5><p>An RGB showcase for your Steam Deck</p><p> The Yigorn Steam Deck Dock Cooler adds a dazzling light show as it cools your Steam Deck, with 12 RGB LEDs to accompany your gameplay.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Small and unobtrusive</li><li>Self-adjusting fan speed makes it convenient to use</li><li>Noise reduction design is a bonus</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>No option to switch off LED lights</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B7F4CKCH?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018376&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/cooling-accessories-steam-deck/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$40 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> This nine-blade cooling fan from Yigorn attaches magnetically to the back of your Steam Deck and is designed to be placed just above the Steam Deck’s own air outlet to boost its efficiency.</p><p> It is fitted with intelligent temperature control and will adjust itself automatically in response to the amount of heat generated through the Steam Deck itself. Semiconductor radiator noise reduction keeps the fan’s operation nice and quiet, and 12 RGB LEDs keep it looking pretty while it’s doing its thing.</p><p> If you’re using any kind of protective casing for your Steam Deck, you’ll need to remove that before attaching this fan, but this a strong magnet that will stay rooted to the spot once put in place. A worthy alternative for consideration to keep your Steam Deck cool. However, ensure you’re happy about the LED light show first, as it can’t be switched off while in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/benazcap-steam-deck-cooler.jpg"                      alt="Benazcap Steam Deck Cooler"                ></p><p>Best Integrated Design</p><h5 id="Benazcap-Detachable-Semi-Conductor-Steam-Deck-Cooler-1"><a href="#Benazcap-Detachable-Semi-Conductor-Steam-Deck-Cooler-1" class="headerlink" title="Benazcap Detachable Semi-Conductor Steam Deck Cooler"></a>Benazcap Detachable Semi-Conductor Steam Deck Cooler</h5><p> A Steam Deck backplate with integrated cooling fan</p><p> $14$20 Save $6</p><p> The Benazcap Detachable Semi-Conductor Steam Deck Cooler replaces your existing Steam Deck backplane and features an integrated cooling fan.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Innovative built-in fan design</li><li>Runs quietly and without vibration</li><li>Includes kickstand for tabletop gameplay</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Needs to be plugged in to work</li><li>Must remove existing back plate to install</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS3JYFPR?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2018376&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/cooling-accessories-steam-deck/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$14 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Benazcap’s Detachable Semi-Conductor Steam Deck Cooler offers something a bit different from typical accessories. Essentially, it’s a backplane for your Steam Deck with a built-in heat-dissipating fan. And as such, it requires a bit of legwork from you to install. Luckily, it comes packaged with all the tools for the job.</p><p> As it’s designed to replace your Steam Deck’s original back cover, you will need to unscrew the old, and screw in the new. The new back panel has a built-in fan designed for heat dissipation, which works without any magnets or coolants. It also features a kick stand and back buttons.</p><p> On the plus side, it runs very quietly and without any vibration. Plus, there’s the bonus of it keeping your Steam Deck cooler for longer. On the downside, it needs to be plugged in for the fan to work, and it’s not the most aesthetically pleasing design. However, if you tend to favor function over form, this is one cooling solution that’s worth considering.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/binkoplay-v1-steam-deck-fan.jpg"                      alt="binkoplay v1 steam deck fan"                ></p><p>Best Alternative Option</p><h5 id="BINBOKPLAY-V1-Steam-Deck-Fan-for-Cooling-1"><a href="#BINBOKPLAY-V1-Steam-Deck-Fan-for-Cooling-1" class="headerlink" title="BINBOKPLAY V1 Steam Deck Fan for Cooling"></a>BINBOKPLAY V1 Steam Deck Fan for Cooling</h5><p>A clamp-on cooler for your Steam Deck</p><p> The BINBOKPLAY V1 Steam Deck Fan is an adjustable cooling fan that clamps onto your Steam Deck to keep it cool as you play.

It offers a reduction in temperature of up to a5 degrees and can operate continuously for seven hours on a full charge.</p><p> You can adjust the cooling speed of the fan by rotating the switch, until you achieve the level of cooling that you want. At the base of the fan, you’ll find an LED power indicator to let you know when it’s time to recharge the fan. Plus, there’s a metal kickstand to allow for tabletop gameplay which can be adjusted from 30 to 60 degrees.</p><p> It doesn’t obstruct the Steam Deck’s built-in air vents, which is a plus point. So, the heat dissipation it provides works in addition to this. On the negative side, you do run the risk of overuse resulting in the odd few scuff marks on your Steam Deck, from it wearing the clamp.</p><h2 id="How-To-Choose-the-Right-Steam-Deck-Fan-for-You"><a href="#How-To-Choose-the-Right-Steam-Deck-Fan-for-You" class="headerlink" title="How To Choose the Right Steam Deck Fan for You"></a>How To Choose the Right Steam Deck Fan for You</h2><p> Choosing the right kind of Steam Deck fan for you will depend on a few factors. Chief among them, is how are you looking to play your Steam Deck?</p><p> If you want to enjoy your favorite titles on a big-screen TV or projector, it makes sense to choose a Steam Deck fan that’s been built into a docking station. This will serve two purposes and might mean you save a few dollars in the process, too. Docking stations such as the MEDIRONE Docking Station don’t cost the Earth and offer an effective means to kill two birds with one stone. With its HDMI port, it allows for big-screen gaming, while its dual cooling fans let you enjoy gaming on your TV for longer.</p><p> However, if big-screen action isn’t your thing, and you prefer gaming on the go, then something like the Devaso Steam Deck Fan Cooler is just the ticket. It’s lightweight and portable, and snaps easily onto the back of your handheld, keeping it nice and cool. And with an extreme cooling mode, you can enjoy portable gaming on your Steam Deck like never before.</p><p> Our top pick of the current crop of Steam Deck cooling fans and accessories is the RuntoGOL Docking Station. Providing multiple solutions in one place, it functions as a reliable and sturdy docking station for big-screen action, or tabletop gameplay. With it, you can connect a wired mouse or keyboard (or wirelessly with a USB dongle), to enhance your gameplay experience.

Many soccer fanatics and more casual players still adore that retro game because it’s both an accessible yet in-depth soccer management simulator that’s not overly complex, with many playable leagues and a big database of players.</p><p> Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 soccer management game on a Windows 11&#x2F;10 PC.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP"><a href="#1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP" class="headerlink" title="1.

Mount the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 ISO File</h2><p> Now you’ve installed WinCDEmu, you can mount the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 ISO file with that software. These are the steps for mounting the Championship Manager ISO:</p><ol><li>Open the extracted<strong>cm0102</strong> folder that includes the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 ISO file within Explorer.</li><li>Right-click the<strong>CM0102.iso</strong> file to select<strong>Open</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-open-option.jpg"                      alt="The Open option"                ></li><li>Then select a suitable letter for your virtual drive on the drop-down menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mount-a-disc-image-window.jpg"                      alt="The Mount a disc image window"                ></li><li>Select<strong>OK</strong> to mount the ISO file.</li></ol><p><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-virtual-cd-drive.jpg" alt="The virtual drive for Championship Manager 01/02"></p><p> You should now see a new virtual CD drive within File Explorer. Click<strong>This PC</strong> in Explorer’s sidebar to view drives there. There you’ll see a CM0102 CD drive with the letter you selected for it.</p><h2 id="4-Install-Championship-Manager-01-02-With-Its-Setup-Wizard"><a href="#4-Install-Championship-Manager-01-02-With-Its-Setup-Wizard" class="headerlink" title="4.

Install Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 With Its Setup Wizard</h2><p> The final stage is to install Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 with its setup wizard. That setup wizard is accessible on the virtual disc drive mounted with the ISO. You can install Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 as follows:</p><ol><li>Click<strong>CD Drive CM0102</strong> within File Explorer’s left sidebar.</li><li>Then double-click the<strong>Setup.exe</strong> installer for Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02.<br><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-setup-exe-file.jpg" alt="The Setup.exe file for Championship Manager 01/02"></li><li>Select<strong>English</strong> and click<strong>OK</strong> on the<strong>Choose Setup Language</strong> drop-down menu.</li><li>Click<strong>Yes</strong> to continue within the setup screen.</li><li>Select<strong>Browse</strong> to choose an installation directory for the game and click<strong>Next</strong> again.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-browse-option.jpg"                      alt="The Browse option in the Championship Manager setup screen"                ></li><li>The<strong>Typical</strong> setup option will be selected by default. Click<strong>Next</strong> to continue with that option selected.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-typical-option.jpg"                      alt="The Typical option in the Championship Manager setup screen"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Next</strong> again to install Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02.</li><li>Click<strong>Yes</strong> when asked about creating a Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 desktop shortcut.</li><li>Select<strong>Finish</strong> to leave the setup screen.</li></ol><p> Click the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 desktop shortcut to start the game. The game will run at a low 800 x 600 resolution, which isn’t something you can change. Selecting to play Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 in windowed mode will crash the game when your monitor is set at a resolution higher than 800 x 600 pixels.</p><p><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/championship-manager-game.jpg" alt="The Championship Manager 01/02 title screen"></p><p> Press the<strong>Start New Game</strong> button to select the countries to include in your game.

You can find several OLED monitors today for under $1,000.</li></ul><p> Are you on the fence about buying an OLED monitor? Since 2022, I’ve been using an OLED monitor as the main display for my PC, and I can confidently say I can’t go back to an LCD monitor anymore. Here’s why you should go for it.</p><h2 id="1-Unmatched-Picture-Quality"><a href="#1-Unmatched-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Unmatched Picture Quality "></a>1. Unmatched Picture Quality <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/oled-and-lcd-monitor-side-by-side-on-a-desk-showing-picture-quality.jpg"                      alt="OLED and LCD monitor side by side on a desk showing picture quality"                ></h2><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> The first thing you’ll immediately notice after upgrading to an OLED monitor, especially if you’re coming from a standard LCD monitor, is the picture quality.</p><p> OLED displays can shut off each pixel individually, and this makes a huge difference when it comes to black levels. The blacks you see on OLED displays during a dark scene are true blacks because the pixels shut off, and as a result, you get an infinite contrast ratio.</p><p> LCD displays, on the other hand, have a backlight that remains on even while showing pitch-black content. Take a look at the image above, for example. You can immediately tell the monitor on the left uses an LCD panel due to its backlighting.</p><p> And if that’s not enough, I want to point out that the monitor on the left has a 4K resolution, whereas the OLED monitor on the right is 1440p. I still prefer watching videos on the OLED monitor despite the lower resolution due to its superior picture quality, no matter what angle I look at it from.</p><p> Even if I look at the monitor from the side, the colors never appear washed out, and the picture quality remains consistent. If you prefer a display with a wide viewing angle, you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/buy-oled-tv-pros-and-cons/" >consider buying an OLED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or monitor, as these displays are unmatched in that aspect.</p><h2 id="2-True-HDR-Experience"><a href="#2-True-HDR-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2.

That’s because the pixels can shut off individually, which gives these displays a huge advantage in a 10 percent window (i.e., 10 percent of the display shows a white screen while the rest is black).</p><p> It’s worth noting that OLED monitors are indeed no match for mini-LED displays or VA monitors in terms of HDR brightness levels. The latter can exceed 1,000 nits in some cases. However, the unmatched black levels and infinite contrast ratio of OLED monitors give them the edge; they offer better visual immersion, especially in a dark room.</p><h2 id="3-Instant-Response-Time-for-Gaming"><a href="#3-Instant-Response-Time-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="3.

That’s because OLED displays have a near-instant pixel response time of 0.03ms. In comparison, the fastest TN LCD monitors advertise a 0.5ms response time. But what does this mean in real-world use?</p><p> In fast-motion scenes, OLED monitors will appear clearer, as they leave no trails behind moving objects. This means you don’t experience <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-monitor-ghosting-how-do-you-fix-it/" >“monitor ghosting” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — an issue that plagues almost all LCD monitors, even at higher refresh rates.</p><p> Simply put, the lower the monitor’s response time, the less ghosting you’ll experience. However, most gaming monitors have a response time between 1ms and 3ms, which is no match compared to OLED displays.</p><p> Many gaming monitors have a pixel overdrive feature to lower the response time and minimize ghosting. However, this causes another issue known as inverse ghosting, where the pixel changes colors quickly and overshoots what the target color is supposed to be, creating a ghost image on the screen. You won’t experience any of these issues on an OLED display.</p><h2 id="4-Most-OLED-Monitors-Include-Burn-In-Warranty"><a href="#4-Most-OLED-Monitors-Include-Burn-In-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is mostly why people hesitate to buy an OLED TV or monitor. While it’s true that screen burn-in is unavoidable in the long term, I haven’t seen image retention on my OLED monitor despite using it daily since 2022.</p><p> Sure, if you display a static screen on an OLED monitor for hours daily over a long period, you will eventually see image retention. Fortunately, most OLED monitors in the market today offer OLED panel care features like pixel shift, pixel refresh, and panel refresh. As long as you utilize them, the chances of screen burn-in are minimal.</p><p> If you’re still concerned, we’re happy to let you know that most OLED monitors are backed by a two- or three-year warranty, which includes coverage for screen burn-in. For example, Dell and MSI back their OLED monitors with a three-year warranty, whereas Asus offers a two-year burn-in warranty. But be sure to check the warranty details on the monitor’s specs page.</p><h2 id="5-OLED-Monitors-Aren’t-as-Expensive-as-You-Think"><a href="#5-OLED-Monitors-Aren’t-as-Expensive-as-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="5.

Sure, they used to be expensive in 2022 when the technology was new in monitors, but in 2024, you can find several OLED monitors for under $1,000.</p><p> MSI’s flagship 4K&#x2F;240Hz QD-OLED monitor, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-321URX-QD-OLED-Quantum/dp/B0CTSC3VS4?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032112&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/why-buy-oled-monitor/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >MSI MPG 321URX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , has an MSRP of $950.

However, Windows has not released a software architecture allowing you to run Windows naturally on an Apple silicon Mac. That means gamers who would like to play Windows games must use virtualization software.</p><p> While Parallels is great, it only uses a fraction of your Mac’s power, giving for subpar gaming performance. That’s where CrossOver comes in; CrossOver will use as much of your Mac’s hardware as possible, and you can download and play Windows Steam games with it.</p><h2 id="Download-Install-and-Set-Up-CrossOver"><a href="#Download-Install-and-Set-Up-CrossOver" class="headerlink" title="Download, Install, and Set Up CrossOver"></a>Download, Install, and Set Up CrossOver</h2><p> The first step to begin your Apple silicon Mac Windows gaming journey is downloading and installing CrossOver.</p><p> You can check if the game you wish to play is compatible with CrossOver by searching for it in the<strong>App Compatibility</strong> section of CrossOver’s website menu. It ranks how compatible a title is with a star rating system. We recommend you search for the games you would like to play there first.</p><p>Follow the steps below to get started:</p><ol><li>Visit <a class="link"   href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#mac" >CodeWeavers website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download CrossOver. The software isn’t free, but you can click the<strong>Free Trial</strong> button on the Mac category to get started with a 14-day trial.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crossover-download-link-on-its-website.jpeg"                      alt="CrossOver download link on its website"                ></li><li>Enter your name and email, and hit<strong>Return</strong> on your keyboard to begin the download.</li><li>Install the application from the crossover.zip file.

Select<strong>Try Now</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/crossover-purchase-dialogue-popup.jpeg"                      alt="CrossOver purchase dialogue popup"                ></li><li>You’ll find yourself in a window with an empty Home page.</li></ol><p> You’ll notice that the menu is divided into<strong>Home</strong> and<strong>Bottles</strong> . Essentially, the<strong>Bottles</strong> section is where all the environments you download and run Windows applications are sorted. The<strong>Home</strong> section, however, contains shortcuts to recently opened Bottles.</p><h2 id="Install-Steam-in-CrossOver"><a href="#Install-Steam-in-CrossOver" class="headerlink" title="Install Steam in CrossOver"></a>Install Steam in CrossOver</h2><p> CrossOver actually makes installing Steam’s bottle very easy. And, of course, before installing Steam,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-steam-how-to-install/" >ensure you have a functioning Steam account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Here’s how to get Steam on CrossOver:</p><ol><li>Click<strong>Install</strong> at the bottom of the CrossOver side menu. You may find Steam in the<strong>Popular Applications</strong> section, but you can also use the search window.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/install-section-of-crossover.jpeg"                      alt="Install section of CrossOver"                ></li><li>Double-click<strong>Steam</strong> and choose<strong>Install</strong> .</li><li>Optional: You can choose which version of Steam you would like to install or what installer you would like to use in the<strong>Details</strong> section of Steam’s information page. Just click<strong>Edit</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/steam-information-page-in-crossover.jpeg"                      alt="Steam information page in CrossOver"                ></li><li>Click<strong>Yes</strong> ,<strong>Next</strong> , or agree to any popups that appear on your screen while the installation continues.</li><li>Microsoft XML Parser Setup will ask you to fill in the User Name and Organization input boxes, but you can leave these sections blank and click<strong>Next</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/microsoft-xml-parser-setup-on-crossover-for-macos.jpeg"                      alt="Microsoft XML Parser Setup on CrossOver for macOS"                ></li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions for Steam’s setup and wait for the app to update. You’ll see Steam’s login screen as soon as it’s finished.</li></ol><p> Return back to CrossOver’s window, and you’ll notice that you have Steam as one of your bottles. Leave Steam alone for now and download some dependencies you would need to run the games you get from Steam.</p><h2 id="Install-DirectX-and-DXVK"><a href="#Install-DirectX-and-DXVK" class="headerlink" title="Install DirectX and DXVK"></a>Install DirectX and DXVK</h2><p> DXVK is a Direct3D translation layer for running 3D applications, while <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-directx-why-important-for-gaming/" >DirectX is a Microsoft API for improving software access to hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You’ll need them both to run your games fluidly.</p><p>Here’s how to install them to your Steam bottle:</p><ol><li><strong>Control</strong> -click or secondary-click<strong>Steam</strong> on the side menu.</li><li>Select<strong>Install software into ‘Steam’,</strong> and CrossOver will take you back to the Install page.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/steam-bottle-context-menu-on-crossover.jpeg"                      alt="Steam Bottle context menu on CrossOver"                ></li><li>Type<strong>DirectX</strong> into the search bar, select<strong>DirectX for Modern Games</strong> , and click<strong>Install</strong> .</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the installation.</li><li>Once it’s finished, repeat the same method for DXVK. Download both<strong>DXVOK (Builtin)</strong> and<strong>DXVK (Upstream)</strong> .</li></ol><p> These two are very important because it lets Steam access your Mac’s GPU. If you try to install games without doing this, Steam will give you an error.</p><h2 id="Set-Up-Steam-Log-In-and-Play"><a href="#Set-Up-Steam-Log-In-and-Play" class="headerlink" title="Set Up Steam, Log In, and Play"></a>Set Up Steam, Log In, and Play</h2><p> You can now return back to Steam and input your username and password. Go to your library, select the game you want to play and install it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/knights-of-pen-paper-ii-on-crossover-steam.jpeg"                      alt="Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II on CrossOver Steam"                ></p><p> Once the game is done installing, you’ll find it in your Steam bottle. You can launch it from there, or you can launch it directly from Steam if you like.</p><p> If you run into any issues starting the game, you can try launching the game directly from its file by following the steps below:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Library</strong> on Steam.</li><li>Secondary-click the game you want to play to open the context menu.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>Manage &gt; Browse local files</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/knights-of-pen-and-paper-2-context-menu-on-steam.jpeg"                      alt="Knights of Pen and Paper 2 context menu on Steam"                ></li><li>Find and select the .exe file for the game and hit<strong>Return</strong> on your keyboard to run it directly from there.</li></ol><p> You can have both your Mac and CrossOver versions of Steam open at the same time. However, it can get a little confusing and easy to mix the two up. You can differentiate them by hovering over their icons on the Dock; CrossOver’s Steam will say<strong>wine64</strong> , while Mac’s Steam will simply say<strong>Steam</strong> .</p><p> However, you don’t need to play only Steam games on CrossOver; most other popular gaming platforms will work. So, if you have your games on GOG or Epic Games Launcher, download those platforms instead of Steam and follow the instructions here all the same.</p><p> Finally, watch out for your hardware. MacBook Airs are decent in processing power, but you could benefit a huge deal from using the extra memory from a MacBook Pro. We, therefore, recommend you use a MacBook Pro to run any serious AAA titles.</p><h2 id="CrossOver-Offers-More-Power-Than-Parallels"><a href="#CrossOver-Offers-More-Power-Than-Parallels" class="headerlink" title="CrossOver Offers More Power Than Parallels"></a>CrossOver Offers More Power Than Parallels</h2><p> Parallels is more popular than CrossOver because it simulates the Windows OS and gives you the option to navigate it just like you would navigate a Windows-powered computer. While that’s great to offer some accessibility and familiarity, the tradeoff is power. Parallels uses about half of your computer’s resources since your Mac has to create a sandbox for it.</p><p> CrossOver looks a lot more barebones and may be less accessible, but you get plenty of power to run games smoothly on a Mac.

It’s packed with features like controller support, save states, and the option to speed up gameplay to get through tedious sections.</p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-sideload-iphone-apps-without-jailbreak/" >install Delta by sideloading it through AltStore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it can not only emulate GBA games but also run SNES, Nintendo DS, N64, and Sega Genesis games.</p><p> Delta also supports local multiplayer, and it even has full AirPlay support, meaning you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-mirror-the-iphone-or-ipad-to-your-tv-ios/" >wirelessly connect your iPhone to a TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mirror the gameplay while using your iPhone as a controller.</p><p> Overall, Delta is an excellent option if you’re looking to emulate not just GBA titles but a range of Nintendo’s retro consoles.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://faq.deltaemulator.com/getting-started/how-to-install-delta" >Delta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="2-Provenance-EMU"><a href="#2-Provenance-EMU" class="headerlink" title="2 Provenance EMU "></a>2 Provenance EMU <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/iphone-running-mario-kart-super-circuit-using-provenance-emu-1-1.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Running Mario Kart Super Circuit Using Provenance EMU"                ></h2><p> Raghav Sethi&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/raghav-sethi/" >MakeUseOf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Provenance EMU, also available through AltStore, offers features similar to Delta, such as saving progress anywhere you want and controller support.</p><p> However, what makes it stand out is that it even has a specific version for tvOS. So, you can install it on your Apple TV, connect a controller, and effectively turn it into a gaming console that can run thousands of retro games.</p><p> It even lets you sync your saves using iCloud, making it the perfect option if you want to pick up your progress on another device, like your iPhone.</p><p> Provenance EMU also supports a wide range of retro consoles, including Sony’s PlayStation 1, making it more versatile. However, its user interface often feels very clunky and lacks several customization options compared to Delta.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="http://provenance-emu.com/" >Provenance EMU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="3-RetroArch"><a href="#3-RetroArch" class="headerlink" title="3 RetroArch "></a>3 RetroArch <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/iphone-running-poke-mon-firered-using-retroarch-2.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Running Pokémon FireRed Using RetroArch"                ></h2><p> Raghav Sethi&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/raghav-sethi/" >MakeUseOf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’ve tried emulating games on other devices, you must’ve heard of RetroArch. It’s by far the most capable emulator out there and provides a ton of features, such as support for online multiplayer, and you can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/make-retro-games-look-like-used-to-retroarch-shaders/" >use RetroArch’s shaders to emulate the look of a CRT TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> RetroArch is also the best multipurpose emulator, as apart from the traditional Nintendo consoles, you can even emulate PSP, PS2, DOS games, and more.</p><p> It’s worth noting that installing RetroArch can be a bit of a hassle, and there is an even steeper learning curve in setting it up. If you’re only planning on simply emulating GBA games without any massive modifications or tweaks, it’s better to opt for Delta or Provenance EMU instead.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="http://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms" >RetroArch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="4-AfterPlay"><a href="#4-AfterPlay" class="headerlink" title="4 AfterPlay "></a>4 AfterPlay <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/03/iphone-running-metroid-fusion-using-afterplay.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Running Metroid Fusion Using AfterPlay"                ></h2><p> Raghav Sethi&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/raghav-sethi/" >MakeUseOf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you’re uncomfortable with sideloading apps on your iPhone, AfterPlay offers a convenient alternative as a browser-based emulator. This means you can play GBA games directly through Safari or any other web browser without having to sideload apps.</p><p> You can simply head to the website, load your GBA ROM, and start playing. However, since it’s browser-based, its performance tends to be more sluggish compared to the other emulators we mentioned. A reliable internet connection is essential for a smooth gameplay experience.</p><p> AfterPlay also has automatic cloud saves, so you can pick up your progress on any device as long as you’re using the same account. While GBA emulation is free, accessing other consoles like the Nintendo DS or PlayStation 1 and features like fast-forward, cheats, and multiple save slots require a premium subscription.</p><p><strong>Visit:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://afterplay.io/" >AfterPlay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, subscription available)</p><p> While none of these GBA emulators for iOS are available on the App Store due to Apple’s policies, you can safely sideload them using AltStore. If you already own a bunch of GBA classics, you can transform your iPhone into a retro gaming powerhouse with the right GBA emulator.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/detecting-digital-disconnectors-on-series-sx/"><u>Detecting Digital Disconnectors on Series S/X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-10-pc-games-in-google-play-games-beta-tests/"><u>Top 10 PC Games in Google Play Games Beta Tests</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-twitch-guide-platform-overview-and-streamer-resources/"><u>The Twitch Guide: Platform Overview and Streamer Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-next-generation-handheld-power-pdw4/"><u>Discover Next Generation Handheld Power - PDW4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/maximizing-your-steam-deck-potential-with-top-9-emulators/"><u>Maximizing Your Steam Deck Potential with Top 9 Emulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/essential-emulators-for-superior-steam-deck-gaming-experience/"><u>Essential Emulators for Superior Steam Deck Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-six-essential-ingredients-for-thrilling-games/"><u>The Six Essential Ingredients for Thrilling Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/understanding-and-justifying-a-dual-capable-screen/"><u>Understanding and Justifying a Dual-Capable Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/microtransactions-in-premium-gaming-rationale/"><u>Microtransactions in Premium Gaming - Rationale?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/risky-reloading-gpus-unstable-future/"><u>Risky Reloading: GPU's Unstable Future</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-brand-presence-effective-instagram-video-marketing-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Brand Presence  Effective Instagram Video Marketing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-gaming-experience-with-these-5-techniques-on-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Gaming Experience with These 5 Techniques on Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exclusive-list-of-the-top-10-digital-recording-apps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Exclusive List of the Top 10 Digital Recording Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-a-step-by-step-manual-for-youtube-shorts-templates-perfection-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Step-by-Step Manual for YouTube Shorts Templates Perfection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-oppo-a58-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On Oppo A58 4G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-danger-lurking-online-spotting-the-falsehood-of-fake-viewers-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Danger Lurking Online  Spotting the Falsehood of Fake Viewers on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-video-loop-editor-top-recommendations/"><u>New In 2024, Free Video Loop Editor Top Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-the-art-of-visual-storytelling-with-top-text-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved  Master the Art of Visual Storytelling with Top Text Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-easy-to-use-games-recorders-ranked-no-1-10/"><u>[Updated] Easy-to-Use Games Recorders Ranked No. 1-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-titles-in-fcpx-essential-skills-for-video-editors/"><u>New In 2024, Mastering Titles in FCPX Essential Skills for Video Editors</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Micro stuttering is when your visuals look jumpy or jittery despite your FPS counter claiming everything is running smoothly. These skips are most noticeable when playing games or browsing online, especially if VSync is enabled.</p><p> The issue currently relates specifically to Nvidia GPUs, and Nvidia is aware of it. So, if you’ve noticed micro stuttering after a recent Nvidia GPU driver update, the Nvidia version 551.46 driver should fix things again. If it doesn’t, you may instead need to perform a more in-depth fix. Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-game-stutter-fix/" >how to fix game stuttering on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h2 id="How-to-Download-and-Install-an-Nvidia-Driver-Update"><a href="#How-to-Download-and-Install-an-Nvidia-Driver-Update" class="headerlink" title="How to Download and Install an Nvidia Driver Update "></a>How to Download and Install an Nvidia Driver Update <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-and-rtx-4080-gpus-together.jpg"                      alt="nvidia rtx 4070 super and rtx 4080 gpus together"                ></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/geforce-rtx-40-super-series" >Nvidia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> As said, Nvidia is aware of the micro stuttering issue affecting its GPUs. However, at the time of writing, Nvidia driver version 551.46 (the driver fix for this issue) isn’t available via the typical methods to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/" >update your Nvidia graphics card drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Right now, the patch is in a beta state, so you need to download and install it manually.</p><p> To grab the newest Nvidia driver, head to the <a class="link"   href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/5519?=&linkId=100000240085402" >Nvidia version 551.46 driver download page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and grab it from there. However, because it’s a beta driver, there’s an extra caveat:</p><blockquote><p>To be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is. They are run through a much abbreviated QA process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly.

Many soccer fanatics and more casual players still adore that retro game because it’s both an accessible yet in-depth soccer management simulator that’s not overly complex, with many playable leagues and a big database of players.</p><p> Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 soccer management game on a Windows 11&#x2F;10 PC.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP"><a href="#1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP" class="headerlink" title="1.

Does your commute take you underground? Either way, you have your reasons for being offline sometimes, but that doesn’t mean you have to be bored while stuck without the internet.</p><p> Your iPhone and&#x2F;or iPad are powerful gaming devices, and you don’t even need access to the internet to enjoy using them. This is thanks to the iOS games you can play offline, and these are the best offline games for iOS.</p><h2 id="1-Alto’s-Adventure"><a href="#1-Alto’s-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="1. Alto’s Adventure"></a>1. Alto’s Adventure</h2><p> Alto’s Adventure is the infinite runner that’ll help you get your skiing fix. Take control of Alto and ski down the slopes of the Andes, picking up coins and avoiding obstacles in the process.</p><p> Use touch controls to make Alto jump or grind and rack up points by performing tricks. The entire game plays offline, so enjoy your Andean adventure from your subway car. The game never finishes, so whenever you’re waiting without Wi-Fi, this game can keep you entertained.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id950812012" >Alto’s Adventure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($4.99)</p><h2 id="2-Alto’s-Odyssey"><a href="#2-Alto’s-Odyssey" class="headerlink" title="2. Alto’s Odyssey"></a>2. Alto’s Odyssey</h2><p> The sequel to Alto’s Adventure, Alto’s Odyssey, keeps everything you liked about the original and adds a little more. New characters, new locations, new music, and a few new mechanics make this game feel more like an expansion than a true sequel.</p><p> Still, if you love Adventure, you’ll love Odyssey too, which focuses more on extreme sports than Adventure focuses on collection.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409" >Alto’s Odyssey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($4.99)</p><h2 id="3-Monument-Valley"><a href="#3-Monument-Valley" class="headerlink" title="3. Monument Valley"></a>3. Monument Valley</h2><p> Have you ever seen one of those impossible paintings by M. C. Escher and wanted to explore them? That’s the entire premise of Monument Valley, an indie puzzle game that is made with the Unity engine. You play as Ro, a little girl wandering through colorful buildings and solving intricate puzzles. Your primary tool is your ability to change the perspective of the screen, which unlocks new paths.</p><p> The beautiful visuals and mysterious setting make this game one of the most thrilling and immersive experiences you can have on your phone, and you can play it entirely offline. You might never need to use the internet again.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409" >Monument Valley <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($3.99, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="4-Monument-Valley-2"><a href="#4-Monument-Valley-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Monument Valley 2"></a>4. Monument Valley 2</h2><p> In the sequel to Monument Valley, you play as Ro’s daughter, navigating the world on a quest to find her. The concept is essentially the same, but the visuals are much more striking, the puzzle-solving much more subtle and nuanced. The beauty of the graphics really shines on a bigger screen, which makes these installments two of the best offline iPad games.</p><p> This game has four more chapters than its predecessor and builds upon the first game’s features. In some worlds, the game replaces the isometric geometry art style from the first game with more 2D scenes.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley-2/id1187265767" >Monument Valley 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($3.99)</p><h2 id="5-BADLAND"><a href="#5-BADLAND" class="headerlink" title="5. BADLAND"></a>5. BADLAND</h2><p> You’re a gooey black ball that just wants to not die. BADLAND is a challenging puzzle game that sends your character through a world of dangerous traps and hazards. Use touch controls to keep your ball afloat, while you watch out for the spinning blades, pointy spikes, and other dangers that will shred it to bits. Various pickups in the world can turn you bigger, smaller, multiply you, and more.</p><p> The challenging gameplay will suck you in. The creepy music and beautiful gothic visuals will keep you coming back. There is a local multiplayer component, but all gameplay can be experienced offline.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/badland/id535176909" >BADLAND <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($0.99)</p><h2 id="6-BADLAND-2"><a href="#6-BADLAND-2" class="headerlink" title="6. BADLAND 2"></a>6. BADLAND 2</h2><p> BADLAND 2 adds some new mechanics, in particular the ability to move your character both left and right, which takes off some of the pressure. The essence of the game remains, however.</p><p> There is a light online multiplayer mode, but like its predecessor, this game really shines offline, on your iPhone, alone with headphones, and immersed in the experience.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/badland-2/id1007120869" >BADLAND 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($0.99)</p><h2 id="7-SevenBloks"><a href="#7-SevenBloks" class="headerlink" title="7.

The rules are simple. You have a 7x6 grid, filled with blocks that have numbers on them, one through seven. Whenever a numbered block is in a column or a row with the same number of block as it features, it clears. If it clears next to a white block, the white block cracks, then breaks to reveal a numbered block.</p><p> The goal, like Tetris, is to not lose by having the blocks go over the top and to rack up points while doing it. It’s simple, but endlessly challenging fun. You can experience everything but the leaderboards offline, making it a great game to play while waiting for an appointment, or riding a train through an area with no Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/sevenbloks/id993693499" >SevenBloks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="8-Mini-Metro"><a href="#8-Mini-Metro" class="headerlink" title="8.

Using maps of real-world cities, you can draw your own lines connecting different stations. You have a limited amount of lines and trains and an ever-increasing number of stations, so you have to place things wisely. If people end up waiting too long at any one station, you lose.</p><p> The maps and the layout are simple and beautiful, with an aesthetic that is similar to the minimalist transit maps found in major cities.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-metro/id837860959" >Mini Metro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ($3.99)</p><h2 id="9-Civilization-VI"><a href="#9-Civilization-VI" class="headerlink" title="9.

Using real-world leaders, place names, and historical monuments, Civ is a turn-based game that takes hours but is easy to play in quick chunks of time. This makes it perfect for iOS.</p><p> Although you can engage in local and online multiplayer, an offline AI campaign is more than enough fun for a long subway or plane ride.

The graphics are beautiful and pull you into the fascinating world of energy and electricity.</p><p> In OHM, you’ll learn about energy and how it works. It explains how energy becomes electricity from an atomic level, working its way up to more significant objects, like transportation. The game comprises several puzzle-based chapters featuring different topics that it explains in a fun and interactive way.</p><p> OHM’s puzzles are mostly straightforward, but that’s what you’d expect from a game that’s supposed to serve an educational purpose.

PewPew lets you experience multidirectional shoot-em-up action at no cost.</p><p> The graphics in PewPew are basic, but it’s perfect if you crave bright neon shape outlines against a black background. PewPew has a high frame rate and features five different game modes: Pandemonium, Dodge This, Assault, Chromatic Conflict, and Asteroids.</p><p> Pandemonium includes enemies that explode or spin maniacally upon death, causing chaos for you. Dodge This challenges you to collect boxes while avoiding enemies. Assault is like classic Geometry Wars, where you fight waves of enemies.</p><p> Chromatic Conflict involves killing only enemies that match your ship’s current color, which gets a bit tricky and requires observation and patience. Finally, Asteroids is like the classic game of the same name that you’ve probably played before.</p><p> As if these game modes aren’t enough, PewPew also has playable ships to unlock and leaderboards to climb. It’s incredible how this game is free with no strings attached.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> PewPew on <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jyaif.pewpew" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pewpew/id314964252" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="7-Underhand"><a href="#7-Underhand" class="headerlink" title="7.

Then check out Underhand by Spoopy Squad—there’s nothing else like it.</p><p> Underhand bills itself as a CCG, which usually stands for “collectible card game,” but here stands for “cultist card game.” That means you take on the role of a cult leader and must manage your cult’s resources effectively.</p><p> Meanwhile, you must respond to various event cards drawn from the deck. Your response to events determines the success of your cult and how far it will go.</p><p> Your cult’s primary goal is to summon an “Ancient One,” but again, this depends on your resource management and success. Otherwise, the cult may fall prey to the trials and tribulations of time itself. Either way, Underhand provides a thrilling choice-based adventure that anyone can enjoy.</p><p> We recommend you carefully go through the tutorial initially because otherwise, you’ll likely end up getting lost.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-Top-6-Gamified-ChatGPT-Experiences"><a href="#Unveiling-Top-6-Gamified-ChatGPT-Experiences" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling: Top 6 Gamified ChatGPT Experiences"></a>Unveiling: Top 6 Gamified ChatGPT Experiences</h2><h3 id="Quick-Links"><a href="#Quick-Links" class="headerlink" title="Quick Links"></a>Quick Links</h3><ul><li><a href="#murder-mystery-mayhem">Murder Mystery Mayhem</a></li><li><a href="#oregon-trail">Oregon Trail</a></li><li><a href="#poker">Poker</a></li><li><a href="#console-gpt">Console GPT</a></li><li><a href="#cookie-clicker">Cookie Clicker</a></li><li><a href="#cute-little-zombies">Cute Little Zombies</a></li></ul><p> Bored of using ChatGPT for programming, chatting, and learning? It’s time to start using it for gaming instead.</p><p> ChatGPT has a wealth of games in its custom GPT store, covering everything from, RPGs and Dungeons and Dragons-style adventures, classic retro games, card games, quizzes, mysteries, and so much more.</p><h2 id="1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem"><a href="#1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem" class="headerlink" title="1. Murder Mystery Mayhem"></a>1. Murder Mystery Mayhem</h2><p> Let’s start with one of the top-rated games on ChatGPT’s custom GPT store. Murder Mystery Mayhem is a procedurally generated game where you play the role of a detective in the year 1925.</p><p>Close</p><p> As with all good investigations, Murder Mystery Mayhem begins by setting the scene, including an image of the scene and the six suspects, along with names, roles, and potential interview points. You then begin questioning each suspect, attempting to find holes in their story, check alibis, and uncover crucial evidence.</p><p> The story isn’t completely linear, but you don’t have much room to develop your detective’s character. I wrote that “I was pacing the room, looking at each suspect in turn, trying to detect a tell, anger, or worry,” but was informed that was outside the boundaries of the game by the Officer (the police officer present at the investigation with you).</p><p> Once you finger your suspect, you call in the Officer to make the arrest. Collar the wrong perp, and the game is over, and you begin with a new mystery.</p><p> Murder Mystery Mayhem is good fun, with the location and murderer changing round by round, and each suspect has new alibis and evidence to reveal. The changes keep it feeling fresh, and one game played through to the end can keep you engaged and seeking the truth for well over an hour. (Don’t forget, you don’t have to play it all at once!)</p><h2 id="2-Oregon-Trail"><a href="#2-Oregon-Trail" class="headerlink" title="2. Oregon Trail"></a>2. Oregon Trail</h2><p> Dying of dysentery has become a longstanding meme from the original Oregon Trail game, but you can now relive that horrifying experience in ChatGPT. The Oregan Trail custom GPT brings one of the first edu-games (not_the_ first, mind!) to ChatGPT… where you can suffer through the wilderness all over again.</p><p>Close</p><p> You begin as the Oregon Trail does: choosing your character and buying supplies, then heading out into the wilderness. Most of your input to the game is choosing between the numbered options, such as where to head next, whether to buy more supplies, explore a new area, hunt for supplies, talk to the locals, look at the map, and so on.</p><p> It’s a basic version of the classic game, but it’s engaging enough. The custom GPT’s scripting doesn’t allow you to go off-piste and, say, rob the local convenience store for supplies (nor did the original), but it’s certainly a lot easier without so many setbacks constantly upending and destroying your party. It’s a much easier version, that’s for sure.</p><h2 id="3-Poker"><a href="#3-Poker" class="headerlink" title="3. Poker"></a>3. Poker</h2><p> From the potential death and horror of the Oregon Trail to something a little more relaxing: Poker. You play against the AI in this Poker custom GPT, starting with 10,000 credits, and play standard five-card Texas hold’em until someone’s credits run out.</p><p>Close</p><p> My only major gripe about this poker game is that ChatGPT seems to mimic your choices, such as check, raise, and so on, which can make the game predictable (or at least less random).</p><h2 id="4-Console-GPT"><a href="#4-Console-GPT" class="headerlink" title="4. Console GPT"></a>4. Console GPT</h2><p> Now, this is a cool idea of how a custom GPT can span multiple types of input to create a custom game with a unique storyline.</p><p> When you first boot Console GPT, you meet the message “BOOT UP AND INSERT GAME.” But you don’t have a game cartridge to boot yet. Instead, you have to head to the <a class="link"   href="https://glif.app/@fab1an/glifs/clotu9ul2002vl90fh6cmpjw0" >Console GPT Glif page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a custom AI art tool that will create your “cartridge.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cyber-syndicate-cartridge-ai-image.jpg"                      alt="cyber syndicate cartridge ai image"                ></p><p> Input the type of game you want in the text box, select<strong>Glif It!</strong> , and watch as your creation comes to life. I went with “retro-futurism crime lord” and was presented with “Cyber Syndicate,” a game where you “navigate a neon-soaked, cyberpunk metropolis teeming with high-tech heists and digital espionage,” with a goal of becoming the ultimate syndicate leader.</p><p> Now, download the Cyber Syndicate cartridge (as an image; it’s not really a cartridge file) by hovering over the image and selecting<strong>Download</strong> .</p><p> Head back to Console GPT and use the image upload button to insert the cartridge. For me, Cyber Syndicate instantly whirrs into life, declaring “COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE DETECTED. LOADING ‘CYBER SYNDICATE.’” The first scenario boots along with a 70 percent full health bar, three options, and, most interestingly, the option to visualize the scene.</p><p>Close</p><p> The narrative flow is a bit shaky, and Console GPT could use some extra commands to remember other parts of the story, but it’s good fun for a while. For example, one moment, I was a lone operative in a bar, and the next, I was planning a heist in a room with the rest of my assembled team.</p><h2 id="5-Cookie-Clicker"><a href="#5-Cookie-Clicker" class="headerlink" title="5. Cookie Clicker"></a>5. Cookie Clicker</h2><p> Not content with card games, custom cartridge adventures, or adventuring? Why not give a custom GPT idle game a try instead?</p><p>Close</p><p> I have to say, this implementation of Cookie Clicker is jarring. Cookie Clicker is one of the most well-known idle games of all time, building up your cookie income over time.</p><p> The custom GPT Cookie Clicker is decidedly different. You’re still building up a cookie empire in a similar style, but because ChatGPT doesn’t run automated commands and cannot keep the numbers ticking over like the original game, it requires more input.</p><p> Still, if you’re into idle games and want to try something different, it could be worth a try.</p><h2 id="6-Cute-Little-Zombies"><a href="#6-Cute-Little-Zombies" class="headerlink" title="6. Cute Little Zombies"></a>6. Cute Little Zombies</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://adventureinked.wixsite.com/gpts/" >Adventure Inked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has developed more than 200 ChatGPT text adventure games, so there are far too many to list here. Cute Little Zombies is a perfect example of why its text adventures are great, giving you a heap of different scenarios to play through, all with cute little AI-generated images to help build the story out.</p><p>Close</p><p> You’re first presented with a list to choose your preferred type of zombie apocalypse. Perhaps you prefer a “Classic Horde,” or maybe you’re more into a “Biotech Disaster” or “Apocalyptic Cult?” Either way, Cute Little Zombies’ list of eight scenarios has you covered. Once you select, the game sets the scene, dropping you into a world filled with ravenous zombies, ready to make you one of their own.</p><p> What I like about Cute Little Zombies is that along with the numbered action options, it also makes it clear you can enter another action you want to take, which helps make the game a little more personal. Plus, the images created within the custom GPT game are ridiculously cute, and the storytelling is decent. I mean, it’s not going to win any prizes for writing, but it’s good enough to draw you in.</p><p> Gaming on ChatGPT is fun, but there is one major frustration that cannot be escaped: ChatGPT’s input limit. As you can only send ChatGPT Plus a limited number of messages (around 40 every three hours), any in-depth gaming will be interrupted periodically to reset the counter. The counter doesn’t roll over, either.
