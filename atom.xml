However, you may have noticed varying opinions on the deal, with some stating that it may destabilize the essential balance between console platforms.</p><p> However, the Activision&#x2F;Blizzard deal with Microsoft has both good and bad implications, regardless of platform loyalty. So what are some of the implications of the Activision&#x2F;Blizzard deal, and is it as bad as you may think? Let’s find out.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-the-Deal-Between-Microsoft-and-Activision-Blizzard"><a href="#What-Is-the-Deal-Between-Microsoft-and-Activision-Blizzard" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Deal Between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard?"></a>What Is the Deal Between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard?</h2><p> Before breaking down the consequences of the deal between Activision&#x2F;Blizzard and Microsoft, you may need a quick refresher regarding what the deal entails.</p><p> Specifically, the deal between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard refers to the acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Microsoft for $68.7 billion, making it the biggest video game acquisition in history.</p><p> The deal allowed Microsoft to own properties such as Call of Duty, Diablo, and World of Warcraft and utilize them on Xbox platforms and services. As for<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-to-get-xbox-game-pass/" >reasons you should use Xbox Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or other Xbox services, including franchises like Call of Duty on gaming services make Xbox services all the more enticing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/diablo-ii-resurrected-loading-screen.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Diablo II Resurrected on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> And with Xbox owning massive Activision&#x2F;Blizzard franchises, there is also the worry that the deal will enable Xbox to turn multiplatform franchises into Xbox exclusives. And while platform exclusivity is a more nuanced effect of the deal, with specific clauses, there are undoubtedly consequences of such an industry-shaking deal.</p><h2 id="The-Potential-Problems-the-Deal-May-Cause-Gamers"><a href="#The-Potential-Problems-the-Deal-May-Cause-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="The Potential Problems the Deal May Cause Gamers"></a>The Potential Problems the Deal May Cause Gamers</h2><p> While the deal is good for Xbox as a platform and Xbox gamers, there are many damaging implications for the industry and gamers alike, even if you’re a huge Xbox fan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Xbox-Owns-a-Sizable-Chunk-of-the-Entire-Gaming-Industry"><a href="#1-Xbox-Owns-a-Sizable-Chunk-of-the-Entire-Gaming-Industry" class="headerlink" title="1. Xbox Owns a Sizable Chunk of the Entire Gaming Industry"></a>1. Xbox Owns a Sizable Chunk of the Entire Gaming Industry</h3><p> One of the main reasons the deal stands to cause issues for gamers is the prospect of Xbox holding a monopoly over the gaming industry. And with a monopoly, competitors are pushed aside, and you could find yourself forced to own an Xbox.</p><p> With Microsoft having already acquired Bethesda in 2021 for $7.5 billion, the scope for Xbox to push consumers to Xbox Series X|S for Bethesda titles already exists. If you want to play the AAA Bethesda title Starfield, you have to own an Xbox Series X|S.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/starfield.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image highlighting the key art for Starfield"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135363/19272" target="_top" id="2135363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135363/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield" >Bethesda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Worryingly, the Bethesda acquisition was around nine times less than the Activision&#x2F;Blizzard deal. And with Activision&#x2F;Blizzard enjoying a massive presence in the gaming industry, titan franchises like Call of Duty and Overwatch could eventually become Xbox exclusives.</p><p> Xbox could use Activision&#x2F;Blizzard exclusivity to monopolize some of gaming’s most popular franchises, forcing you to own an Xbox Series X|S as competitors may not be able to sell specific Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles.</p><h3 id="2-Both-Xbox-and-PlayStation-Are-Prioritizing-Exclusivity"><a href="#2-Both-Xbox-and-PlayStation-Are-Prioritizing-Exclusivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Both Xbox and PlayStation Are Prioritizing Exclusivity"></a>2. Both Xbox and PlayStation Are Prioritizing Exclusivity</h3><p> Aside from Xbox having a monopoly over Activision&#x2F;Blizzard exclusivity and a sizable chunk of the industry, the deal further fuels the exclusivity race with rival platforms like PlayStation.</p><p> While there are many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-xbox-exclusives-to-test-out-your-xbox-series-xs/" >great Xbox Series X|S exclusives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , acquiring Activision&#x2F;Blizzard represents a drastic expansion of the exclusive games Xbox could offer. And typically, this is something that PlayStation is notoriously better at doing than Xbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/god-of-war.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image of God of War Ragnarok depicting a scene from the game"                ></p><p> Image Credit: <a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" >PlayStation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The deal creates a precedent for PlayStation to match Xbox’s practices as its main rival. And with Xbox and PlayStation vying for further exclusivity, consumer choices narrow, forcing you to pick one platform over another to play certain games.</p><p> So, another unfortunate implication of the deal between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard is the furthering of exclusivity competition between all platforms, restricting your choices as a consumer.</p><h3 id="3-A-Mismanaged-Deal-Will-Result-in-Higher-Priced-Games-and-Services-for-Consumers"><a href="#3-A-Mismanaged-Deal-Will-Result-in-Higher-Priced-Games-and-Services-for-Consumers" class="headerlink" title="3. A Mismanaged Deal Will Result in Higher Priced Games and Services for Consumers"></a>3. A Mismanaged Deal Will Result in Higher Priced Games and Services for Consumers</h3><p> Aside from implications and problems linked to exclusivity, Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard has been flagged by independent experts as possibly increasing the costs of games and services.</p><p> The UK-based Competitions and Markets Authority investigated the deal between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard. As reported by<a class="link"   href="https://www.cityam.com/microsofts-activision-blizzard-bid/" >City A.M. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a CMA investigator stated that a mismanaged deal creates “higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/xbox-game-pass-and-ea-play.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for Xbox Game Pass and EA Play"                ></p><p> Image Credit: <a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/xbox-game-pass-ultimate/cfq7ttc0khs0?WT.mc_id=CNavGamesXboxGamePassUltimate" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While not guaranteed, the acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Microsoft is connected by the CMA to a potential increase in the costs you may face for your games and gaming services.</p><p> And while there may be many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-xbox-game-pass-will-get-more-expensive/" >reasons you will see the price of Xbox Game Pass increasing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the price tag of $68.7 billion for Activision&#x2F;Blizzard will only inflate things further. So, even if you’re a fan of Xbox, you may still be affected by price increases associated with the deal.</p><h2 id="Why-the-Activision-Blizzard-Deal-May-Not-Be-as-Bad-as-You-Think"><a href="#Why-the-Activision-Blizzard-Deal-May-Not-Be-as-Bad-as-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="Why the Activision&#x2F;Blizzard Deal May Not Be as Bad as You Think"></a>Why the Activision&#x2F;Blizzard Deal May Not Be as Bad as You Think</h2><p> While you certainly have good reasons to be dubious of the acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Microsoft, there is evidence to suggest that the deal isn’t as problematic for gamers as previously thought.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Exclusive-Games-Have-Always-Been-a-Pivotal-Part-of-Console-Gaming"><a href="#1-Exclusive-Games-Have-Always-Been-a-Pivotal-Part-of-Console-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="1. Exclusive Games Have Always Been a Pivotal Part of Console Gaming"></a>1. Exclusive Games Have Always Been a Pivotal Part of Console Gaming</h3><p> One of the main reasons you may be worried about Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard is how the deal stands to spur on platform exclusivity.</p><p> However, Xbox releases most of its exclusive games on both PC and Xbox, so the idea that the deal would make Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles solely available on Xbox Series X|S is unlikely. And even with an intent to make Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles exclusive, Xbox would be unable to do so until 2038, as reported by the<a class="link"   href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67066870" >BBC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> And if that wasn’t enough, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, confirmed via the Official Xbox Podcast that all future Call of Duty games will be available on all platforms.</p><p> While this doesn’t guarantee the exclusivity status of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles forever, it does set a precedent that Xbox isn’t looking to restrict your options when it comes to gaming.</p><p> And even with new exclusive games, Xbox wouldn’t be doing anything that competitors haven’t done for years. PlayStation, for instance, acquired Bungie for $3.7 billion in 2022 and added PlayStation-exclusive content to Destiny 2.</p><p> So, while exclusivity may worry you, the deal is unable to affect platform exclusivity for at least 15 years, and even if it goes on to do so, it would only be following pre-established trends within the gaming industry.</p><h3 id="2-Xbox-Is-Focused-on-Consumer-Orientated-Gaming"><a href="#2-Xbox-Is-Focused-on-Consumer-Orientated-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="2. Xbox Is Focused on Consumer-Orientated Gaming"></a>2. Xbox Is Focused on Consumer-Orientated Gaming</h3><p> While you may see the deal between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard as stoking problematic issues for gamers, Xbox and its emphasis on consumer choice implies otherwise.</p><p> Despite Xbox holding exclusivity on franchises like Halo and owning massive games like Minecraft, Xbox prioritizes allowing you to choose how you play. Halo: The Master Chief Collection is on Steam, and Minecraft is available and cross-compatible on all platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/halo-the-master-chief-collection-loading-screen.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Halo The Master Chief Collection on Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Along with multiple generations of backwards compatibility for Xbox consoles and Xbox All Access,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-microsoft-has-made-the-xbox-series-xs-the-most-consumer-friendly-console/" >Xbox is one of the most consumer-friendly platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in gaming. Acquiring Activision&#x2F;Blizzard spreads Xbox’s pro-consumer values to Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles.</p><p> Activision&#x2F;Blizzard is also a company marred by controversy, as reported by<a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2023/02/03/activision-blizzard-will-pay-sec-35-million-to-settle-claims-over-its-workplace-misconduct-disclosures/" >Forbes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . And with the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition,<a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2023/10/13/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-set-to-leave-in-december-heres-what-to-know-about-his-controversies/" >Forbes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> highlights that as a result of the deal’s completion, the Managing Director of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard, Bobby Kotick, exited the company.</p><p> So, if you take the pro-consumer practices Xbox engages in with the changing of the guard at Activision&#x2F;Blizzard, the deal injects hope into a troubled company, highlighting a positive change for Activision&#x2F;Blizzard and consumers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Xbox-Is-the-Underdog-of-the-Industry"><a href="#3-Xbox-Is-the-Underdog-of-the-Industry" class="headerlink" title="3. Xbox Is the Underdog of the Industry"></a>3. Xbox Is the Underdog of the Industry</h3><p> There are also reasons for you to see the Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard deal as being unable to provide Xbox with a monopoly over the industry, even with Activision&#x2F;Blizzard titles prioritizing Xbox services.</p><p> Throughout the acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Microsoft, you may have noticed numerous stories and pushback from platforms like PlayStation speaking out against the deal.</p><p> But if you follow the discussions on Xbox and its place in the industry against competitors, Microsoft president Brad Smith said via<a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/microsoft-says-it-offered-ftc-consent-decree-on-call-of-duty?leadSource=uverify%20wall" >Bloomberg UK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that “if you look at the global market, Sony has 70% of that market, and we have 30%”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/playstation-5.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of an PlayStation 5 console and controller atop a white surface"                ></p><p> Brad Smith also cited how PlayStation, at the time of the discussions, had 286 exclusive games and Xbox only had 59 to back up his statements. So, while you may be justifiably worried about the deal’s implications, you could see the acquisition as simply allowing Xbox to catch up to PlayStation.</p><p> Even with the acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard, it may be more likely that competition between Xbox and PlayStation would increase instead of the industry being monopolized.</p><h2 id="The-Acquisition-of-Activision-Blizzard-by-Xbox-Improves-Competition"><a href="#The-Acquisition-of-Activision-Blizzard-by-Xbox-Improves-Competition" class="headerlink" title="The Acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Xbox Improves Competition"></a>The Acquisition of Activision&#x2F;Blizzard by Xbox Improves Competition</h2><p> Despite the deal between Microsoft and Activision&#x2F;Blizzard having negative implications, there are plenty of reasons it isn’t as damaging as previously thought.</p><p> On the contrary, the deal elevates Xbox to a closer level to PlayStation, allowing for closer competition between gaming’s biggest rivals. And better competition means a better industry for consumers.</p><p> And with Xbox and PlayStation producing two rival powerhouse consoles in the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, you could even see the deal as pushing console generations to be the very best platforms possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-peak-level-hd-mastery-in-the-markets-top-recorders/"><u>[New] Peak-Level HD Mastery in the Market's Top Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-revolutionize-selfies-with-top-android-and-ios-face-modifiers/"><u>[New] Revolutionize Selfies with Top Android & iOS Face Modifiers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-fisheye-photography-for-full-spheres/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering Fisheye Photography for Full Spheres</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/6-effective-fixes-for-stability-issues-in-dreamlight-valley-pc-version/"><u>6 Effective Fixes for Stability Issues in Dreamlight Valley PC Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/a-guide-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-4g-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Guide Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-for-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-2023-hard-reset-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial for Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Hard Reset | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/critical-thoughts-before-you-choose-a-ps5-model/"><u>Critical Thoughts Before You Choose a PS5 Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-the-thrills-of-terminal-gaming-on-linux/"><u>Discover the Thrills of Terminal Gaming on Linux</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/essential-lighting-options-for-immersive-games/"><u>Essential Lighting Options for Immersive Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/find-freebies-in-your-area-oodles-local-listings-unveiled/"><u>Find Freebies in Your Area: Oodle’s Local Listings Unveiled!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/game-on-with-superior-wired-network-interfaces/"><u>Game On with Superior Wired Network Interfaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-your-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset your Samsung Galaxy F54 5G Lock Screen Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/negating-recent-xbox-dual-stick-update/"><u>Negating Recent Xbox Dual-Stick Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/reimagining-your-consoles-capabilities-with-xbox-sxs-high-definition-mode/"><u>Reimagining Your Console's Capabilities with Xbox SX's High Definition Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/song-sleuths-mobiles-top-music-quiz-games/"><u>Song Sleuths: Mobile's Top Music Quiz Games</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you want to make use of this handy accessibility feature on your PS5 but you’re not sure how to, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id="What-Does-an-Assist-Controller-Do-on-the-PS5"><a href="#What-Does-an-Assist-Controller-Do-on-the-PS5" class="headerlink" title="What Does an Assist Controller Do on the PS5?"></a>What Does an Assist Controller Do on the PS5?</h2><p> Being able to connect an assist controller to your PS5 is Sony’s answer to the copilot feature on Xbox. Using an assist controller is a far different experience than simply connecting two DualSense controllers and calling it a day.</p><p> Adding a second controller adds another player, who becomes a player two. An assist controller, however, allows two different controllers to operate the same user profile, so the two controllers behave as one single controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/person-holding-dualsense-controller-with-ps4-controller-on-a-red-background.jpg"                      alt="Person holding DualSense Controller with PS4 controller on a red background"                ></p><p> This accessibility feature is particularly helpful for those with decreased mobility. One player can control the direction an avatar is moving or attacking, while the other can take control of the camera, for example.</p><p> It’s also useful for young gamers who need a little extra assistance from a parent to beat a particularly formidable final boss. There are plenty of scenarios where an assist controller could be helpful. So if you want to learn how to use this feature on your PS5, follow the instructions below.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Set-Up-an-Assist-Controller-on-My-PS5"><a href="#How-Do-I-Set-Up-an-Assist-Controller-on-My-PS5" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Set Up an Assist Controller on My PS5?"></a>How Do I Set Up an Assist Controller on My PS5?</h2><p> There are a few things to note before getting started. Firstly, the ability to connect an assist controller to your PS5 was introduced in an update. So, if you haven’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-ps5-auto-updates/" >enabled auto-updates on your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> yet, go ahead and update your PS5 manually to the latest version.</p><p> You also can’t use any controller as an assist controller. You can only connect a DualSense controller or another supported third-party controller. If you have the DualSense Edge controller, it can only be used as the main controller and cannot be used as an assist controller.</p><p> Once you have ticked the boxes above, you are ready to begin. The process is very similar to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-co-pilot-on-xbox-series-xs/" >setting up and using the copilot feature on Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so if you have experience with that, it should be intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/settings-gear-icon-ps5-home-screen.jpg"                      alt="Settings Gear Icon PS5 Home Screen"                ></p><p> Start by connecting a controller and logging into a user profile.

They have small button inputs that require very tight movements and a claw-like grip. This kind of setup just doesn’t work for many people, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be able to enjoy or experience gaming.</p><p> There are many accessibility controllers on the market, but they are often expensive and also have limits to the number of people they can work for. Adding an assist controller to your PS5 is a cheap and effective way to make gaming more accessible on a budget, particularly if you have two controllers already.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-flawless-pixel-processor-windowsmac-for-2024/"><u>[New] Flawless Pixel Processor (Windows/Mac) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-strategic-scheduling-leveraging-free-fb-resources/"><u>[New] Strategic Scheduling Leveraging Free FB Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-create-effective-youtube-advertisements-on-a-budget-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Create Effective YouTube Advertisements on a Budget for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-microphone-feedback-audio-recorder/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Microphone Feedback Audio Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-instagram-reels-like-professionals-top-10-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Instagram Reels Like Professionals - Top 10 Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-public-access-zen-beats/"><u>2024 Approved Public Access Zen Beats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-strategic-screen-customization-timely-adjustments-in-teams/"><u>2024 Approved Strategic Screen Customization Timely Adjustments in Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-photographers-toolkit-top-text-editors-for-images/"><u>2024 Approved The Photographer's Toolkit Top Text Editors for Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gaming-systems-showdown-consoles-vs-personal-builds/"><u>Gaming Systems Showdown: Consoles Vs.

The stand did have a slight wobble, especially when my kids ran through the living room, but I was never worried about the set toppling over. </p><p>If inputs are a concern, the QN90C has four HDMI ports (one eARC), all of which support HDMI 2.1.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the ports on the back.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The set uses Samsung’s own Tizen software as an operating system. This was my first experience with Tizen, and while it wasn’t as user-friendly as Roku or Google TV, I could navigate where I wanted to go without much trouble. </p><p>On the display side, this is a Quantum Mini-LED, which Samsung first introduced in 2021. As the name implies, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/neo-qled-vs-oled-which-technology-is-right-for-you/" >the LEDs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are much smaller here than usual, leading to better backlight control. However, Samsung claims to take that a step further with microlayers inside the LEDs that eliminate noise.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s support for HDR10 and HDR10+, and online reports put the brightness at nearly 2,000 nits – meaning it’s bright enough for most home and office environments.</p><p>My living room has a fair amount of natural light shining where my TV sits, and this set’s display thrives in that environment, largely due to its anti-reflection film. There are times with my everyday television that I have to close my blinds because of glare, but the QN90C was bright enough to make that unnecessary. I fired up a personal favorite, Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things,</em> to test the display, and it was the most I’ve enjoyed that show visually. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/lg-vs-samsung-tv-which-brand-should-you-buy-in-2024/" >LG vs Samsung TV: Which brand should you buy in 2024? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The QN90C also utilizes local dimming control, which takes unused electrical power from dark areas of the screen and diverts it to brighter areas. I was impressed with how that worked here. Dark scenes were dark as intended, but black levels still had a contrast where things were clearly visible. Bright colors popped beautifully, and scenes with fast action showed no signs of blur. </p><p>Samsung has its Neural Quantum Processor on board for upscaling content. This uses AI to add depth and sharpness to content regardless of the original resolution—essentially making everything 4K. I tested this out with <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> and loved how things looked. I’ve had televisions where the upscaling produced far too unnatural-looking results, but the QN90C does this very well.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>When it comes to sound, this set is plenty sufficient as-is. It supports Dolby Atmos, but even without a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sound-system/" >sound bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I could hear dialogue clearly over the bustle of my two kids and dog. I keep closed captions on my everyday TV for this very reason, even when using a sound bar, and it was nice to be able to turn that off for a while.</p><p>Like other <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-samsung-tv/" >Samsung televisions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it supports object tracking, which sends sounds to the relevant part of the screen. For example, if you’re watching a movie with a racing scene, you’ll audibly notice the engine sound roar left to right along with the car.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/samsung-has-its-own-line-of-video-game-controllers-now-heres-the-first-model/" >Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here’s the first model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When I started digging into the gaming features, though, I found where this television <em>really</em> shined. It has a very low input lag (under 10ms), a 120Hz display, support for variable refresh rate, and Samsung’s above-average Game Bar feature. </p><p>Holding the pause&#x2F;play button while a video game console is on brings up the menu overlay. From there, you can dig into settings like Game Picture Mode (there are six to choose from, plus two custom options), Game Motion Plus (which reduces motion blur and improves picture quality), and an on-screen crosshair (with three color options).</p><p>From that bar, there’s a deeper game mode settings option, which lets you tune the black equalizer, choose “basic” or “advanced” for HDR, and even choose the level of judder reduction and blur reduction. </p><p>Most casual gamers wouldn’t dive this deep into these settings, but this is a fantastic thing to have for serious gamers. It’s the deepest level of customization I’ve seen from a gaming menu. I’d call this easily one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-tv/" >best gaming TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I’ve come across. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN55QN90C/dp/B0BTTVBDVD?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca809cba9-2efa-4131-bfb0-67fc93c07357%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung QN90C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> TV has a few minor annoyances – I’m hesitant to call the wobbliness and installation process shortcomings – but its picture quality in every instance and gaming features more than made up for those.

However, Xbox’s ban only affects “unauthorized” third-party controllers, as evidenced by<a class="link"   href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/errors/error-code-0x82d60002" >the official Xbox website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . All third-party accessories involved in the Designed for Xbox program are unaffected.</p><p> As for why Xbox felt the need to ban “unauthorized” third-party accessories and controllers, there are a few main factors:</p><ul><li>Banning “unauthorized” third-party devices allows Xbox to ensure all controllers and accessories on its platform are part of the Designed for Xbox program and safe to use.</li><li>Third-party providers of unofficial Xbox accessories can include devices like Cronus Zen that allow for or make cheating easier.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3186.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the homepage of the advertisement site for Cronus Zen gaming accessories"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.cronusmax.com/" >Cronus ZEN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li>By banning unofficial third-party devices, Xbox ensures you can only purchase official or Designed for Xbox accessories and controllers, which encourages Xbox sales.</li></ul><p> So, while there are sales incentives for Xbox, the ban itself acts to quality control the third-party controllers and accessories you can use on Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S.</p><p> However, if you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/" >connect an Xbox controller to your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can still use unofficial controllers for PC gaming, just not via an Xbox One or Series X|S.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576474/17382" target="_top" id="1576474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576474/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Happens-if-You-Use-an-“Unauthorized”-Third-Party-Controller"><a href="#What-Happens-if-You-Use-an-“Unauthorized”-Third-Party-Controller" class="headerlink" title="What Happens if You Use an “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controller"></a>What Happens if You Use an “Unauthorized” Third-Party Controller</h2><p> While Xbox may have had good reason to ban unofficial third-party devices, you will still want to know how your devices are affected by the ban.</p><p> Luckily, how Xbox bans “unauthorized” third-party devices provides you time to return your device or contact the manufacturer. So, regarding what happens if you connect an “unauthorized” third-party device to your Xbox, the process is as follows:</p><ul><li>If you connect an unauthorized controller or accessory to your Xbox console, you will receive the error code:<strong>0x82d60002</strong> .</li><li>From the point of receiving error code<strong>0x82d60002</strong> , you have two weeks before your device is banned from being used with your Xbox.</li><li>Xbox advises that within the two weeks time-frame, you contact the manufacturer of the device or return it to seek a refund.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/f9pkrwrwkaai38k.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the error code that appears when using an unauthorized controller on Xbox"                ></p><p> Image Credit: NBA 2K24 Intel&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/2KIntel/status/1718796468692173155" >Twitter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you are unsure if your third-party device is “unauthorized”, you can connect it to your Xbox.

In fact, despite the ban, you can utilize a vast majority of third-party Xbox devices.</p><p> Xbox still supports third-party devices involved in the Designed for Xbox program.

A favorite song from your youth, or a favorite childhood movie, for instance. Re-engaging with these things can often take us right back to those days gone by when life was arguably simpler and more carefree.</p><p> The video games of yesteryear can be particularly nostalgic too and can evoke all sorts of warm, fuzzy feelings inside. Small wonder then, that video game companies are tapping into the retro gaming phenomenon, by repurposing and repackaging some of your all-time favorite games and consoles.</p><p> And if you’re a retro gaming fan, you’ll find some of today’s modern consoles are also great for playing those classic (and forgotten classic) games.</p><p>Here are the best modern retro gaming consoles available

Switch console and one of the best handheld gaming consoles on the market (and great fun to play in docked mode too).</p><p> What is perhaps less well known, however, is that the Switch OLED is also a great place to enjoy retro games. In addition to re-released and remastered physical versions of some of the gaming greats from the early 2000s, you can also enjoy a huge library of retro classics and bask in those gaming glory days of old!</p><p> The catch? Well, you have to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service. But so long as you don’t mind shelling out for a separate subscription service (even if it is through gritted teeth), you will find a path to retro gaming heaven!</p><p> Subscribers to the Nintendo Switch Online service have access to a catalog of classic games from the NES and the SNES consoles. And for a small additional cost, you can also have access to classics from the Nintendo 64 and SEGA Genesis generations of consoles.</p><p> So, whether you’re into Super Mario All-Stars, Blaster Master, Star Fox 64, or Banjo-Kazooie, you’ll find them all here. Granted, you’ll have to grease Nintendo’s palms with silver to get access to them, but as a lifelong gamer, you’re probably used to that already, hey?</p><p> Despite this, the Nintendo Switch OLED is brilliant for retro gaming. And thanks to its versatility, you can enjoy these classics in handheld, docked, or tabletop modes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/valve-steam-deck.jpg"                      alt="Valve Steam Deck"                ></p><p>Best for Steam</p><h5 id="Steam-Deck-1"><a href="#Steam-Deck-1" class="headerlink" title="Steam Deck"></a>Steam Deck</h5><p> A handheld gaming PC that can be tweaked for retro gaming</p><p> $435$499 Save $64</p><p> Valve’s Steam Deck is a handheld PC that allows you to play emulated games on the go, making it a great choice for retro game enthusiasts.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Offers mobile PC gaming</li><li>Emulators allow for plenty of choice with retro gaming</li><li>Optimized for handheld gaming</li><li>Can upgrade storage space with a microSD card</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Entry-tier 64 GB version doesn’t offer a lot of storage space</li><li>Can run a little hot</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/dp/B0BFC555RF?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2016666&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-modern-retro-consoles/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$435 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Valve-Steam-Deck-64-GB/1002540954" >$460 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Unsurprisingly perhaps, Valve’s Steam Deck is a great place to enjoy retro games. For starters, its seven-inch IPS screen with 1280 x 800 resolution and 400-nit brightness renders those retro graphics beautifully. And being designed to run the latest AAA titles, it shouldn’t have any trouble at all running your retro game collection.</p><p> Steam Deck’s Linux-based operating system, SteamOS, allows a great deal of versatility for retro gaming fans too. There’s already an extensive library of games available on the Steam Store to tickle your fancy, and (though we won’t offer explainers here) there are various emulators available that will allow you to run retro titles from just about every retro game console you can think of.</p><p> Steam Deck is also great for big-screen gaming too and can be easily hooked up to your TV. And though you might find its precision trackpads a little redundant for older titles, the thumb stick and D-pad controls will more than suffice. So, although you might not be considering a Steam Deck primarily for retro gaming, it’s great to know there are a wealth of options to explore here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/asus-rog-ally.jpg"                      alt="ASUS ROG Ally"                ></p><p>Best for Emulators</p><h5 id="Asus-ROG-Ally-1"><a href="#Asus-ROG-Ally-1" class="headerlink" title="Asus ROG Ally"></a>Asus ROG Ally</h5><p>Enjoy retro and AAA gaming on the go</p><p> $615$669 Save $54</p><p> The ASUS Rog Ally is a powerful Windows-based handheld PC capable of emulating your favorite retro game consoles.

And like Valve’s Steam Deck, it’s probably fair to say that the chief reason to own one is to enjoy AAA gaming on the go. However, being keen to prove that “anything you can do, I can do better,” ASUS has made sure that retro gaming has not been forgotten with this powerhouse of a handheld.</p><p> It comes fitted with a seven-inch FHD IPS screen that offers an impressive 1920 x 1080 resolution, and a 512GB hard drive. It comes with Windows 11 pre-installed and can be used to enjoy most PC titles, as well as a truckload of retro ones. It supports most major launchers (including Steam) and can emulate your favorite retro consoles, too.</p><p> On the downside, that price tag is a doozy. Costing the best part of a grand, it’s a serious investment, which could be prohibitive for many. Then there’s the battery life, which gives you three to four hours at a time, and the ROG Ally’s operation can be a little buggy at times.</p><p> However, there’s no denying that it’s an incredible piece of hardware that offers gamers the best of both worlds. An exciting way to play your favorite AAA or retro titles on the go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/playstation-classic.jpg"                      alt="PlayStation Classic"                ></p><p>Best Budget</p><h5 id="PlayStation-Classic-1"><a href="#PlayStation-Classic-1" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Classic"></a>PlayStation Classic</h5><p> Retro gaming joy without the modern-day price tag</p><p> $66$99 Save $33</p><p> The PlayStation Classic is a 45 percent smaller version of Sony’s classic game console, pre-loaded with 20 classic titles.

And though for some of us, our youth may be a distant yacht, the games we enjoyed back then are not. This reformed miniature PS One console features 20 PlayStation Classics, relaunched for the modern world, and is 45 percent smaller than its much older brother.</p><p> Among the included titles, you can find stone-cold classics like Tekken 3, Metal Gear Solid, and Final Fantasy VII. And though there are a few glaring omissions from this roster (no Gran Turismo, for instance), it’s still pretty solid, like Snake. Although, you can’t help feeling like they could have done a little more here and added a few extra games for good measure.</p><p> Joyfully, there is a second controller included here, too, which makes this mini console stand apart from many other single-controller console units out there. And it looks and feels authentic. This is a great way to experience where it all began with Sony’s flagship game console, all over again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SNES-CLASSIC-MINI.webp"                      alt="SNES CLASSIC MINI"                ></p><p>Best for Two-Players</p><h5 id="Nintendo-SNES-Classic-Mini-1"><a href="#Nintendo-SNES-Classic-Mini-1" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo SNES Classic Mini"></a>Nintendo SNES Classic Mini</h5><p> Team up with a buddy for classic retro gaming action</p><p> This miniature version of Nintendo’s classic SNES console comes pre-loaded with 21 great retro titles for you to enjoy.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Miniature version of one of Nintendo’s most loved consoles</li><li>21 pre-loaded games cover most of the classics</li><li>Includes two controllers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Could be a few more titles included</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BVHY3F?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2016666&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-modern-retro-consoles/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$380 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Super-Nintendo-Mini-Classic-SNES-Console-Europe-Model/176726339" >$300 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you have the bucks to spare, don’t mind the initial outlay, and would rather not pay a premium for an online service for your retro gaming fix, you could do much worse than consider the Super Nintendo Classic mini console.</p><p> Essentially, it’s the ‘Mini Me’ to the SNES’s Dr. Evil. A miniature version of the same console, roughly one-quarter of the original size. The chief differences with the mini are that there’s no working port for your games cartridges to slot into and all the available games that you’re ever likely to play on it are already pre-installed.</p><p> There are 21 retro titles included in this package, including classics like Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Super Mario Kart, F-Zero, Castlevania IV, and more. If these names are enough to whet your whistle, then you’ll likely find a lot that’s to your liking here.</p><p> An HDMI port at the back of this mini console means you can plug it straight into your TV at home. No doubt retro gamers revisit the classics for the gameplay rather than for the graphics, but still; you should probably prepare yourselves if you’re planning on hooking this up to a huge TV. It ain’t gonna be pretty!</p><p> The number of games included might not be that impressive by today’s standards, but the games themselves are. Full of charm and still great fun to play—it’s what Nintendo does, after all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NES-mini.jpg"                      alt="NES mini"                ></p><p>Best for Nostalgia</p><h5 id="Nintendo-NES-Classic-Mini-1"><a href="#Nintendo-NES-Classic-Mini-1" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo NES Classic Mini"></a>Nintendo NES Classic Mini</h5><p> Huddle around the TV for some retro gaming joy</p><p> $220$288 Save $68</p><p> The Nintendo NES Classic Mini features 30 built-in retro games and is a perfect slice of gaming nostalgia.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Classic retro gaming action</li><li>Decent amount of built-in games</li><li>More affordable than the SNES version</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Only one controller pad included</li><li>Controller wire is rather short</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P875QTN?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2016666&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-modern-retro-consoles/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$230 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-NES-Classic-Edition-Entertainment-System/54043501" >$220 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Similar to the SNES classic mini but even more retro is the Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES) Classic Mini. A previous generation rebuild of the classic console with a variety of pre-loaded games for you to enjoy.</p><p> You could argue that the NES Classic Mini represents better value for money, seeing as it carries a slightly cheaper price tag and has more games installed than the SNES Classic Mini. There are 30 games from the original generation NES here, including Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, and 3, The Legend of Zelda, and Ninja Gaiden—to name a few.</p><p> However, unlike the SNES version, only one controller is included in this package. So you will need to buy another separately before you and a friend can get stuck into any classic two-player action. Another minor criticism of this package is that the cable that connects your controller to the console is rather mini as well, and you may therefore have to sit slightly closer to the screen than you would like.</p><p> Small pains aside, there are hours of fun to be had here, with a decent amount of OG Nintendo titles for your gaming pleasure. Whether you plump for this or the SNES version will probably depend on which generation you grew up with.</p><p> It doesn’t get much more retro than this, though. And gaming aficionados will no doubt delight in re-treading these classics, and maybe in conquering the previously unconquerable now that their skills have matured—as some of these games are particularly tough!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/XBox-Series-X.jpg"                      alt="XBox Series X"                ></p><p>Best for Xbox</p><h5 id="Microsoft-Xbox-Series-X-1"><a href="#Microsoft-Xbox-Series-X-1" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft Xbox Series X"></a>Microsoft Xbox Series X</h5><p> Experience four generations of classic Xbox titles</p><p> $449$500 Save $51</p><p> With an Xbox Live subscription, you can enjoy four generations of Xbox gaming, courtesy of this sleek gaming cuboid.

But hear us out.</p><p> There is a pretty staggering amount of older and even retro games to enjoy via this all-singing, all-dancing current-generation console. However, as with the Nintendo Switch OLED, access to these titles requires you to place your hands in your pocket and fork out for an online subscription service.</p><p> For Xbox Live subscribers, you can have access to titles from across four generations of Xbox gaming, all of which are yours to download and keep for however long you maintain your membership. As you might expect, there are several membership tiers to choose from.</p><p> You can download and enjoy original classics from the Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One as well as the current generation of Series X games. Subscription to Xbox Live Gold also includes an EA Play membership at no additional cost. And Cloud gaming on Xbox Game Pass also supports Xbox gameplay on some of your other existing devices.</p><p> So, if you’re looking for a modern gen console but want to explore hundreds of older-generation titles as well, you can have your cake and eat it with the Xbox Series X.

Its 4.3-inch IPS screen boasts a vibrant 800 x 480 resolution and the console itself comes with 18 classic Capcom titles pre-installed (including Street Fighter II, Ghouls and Ghosts, and Mega Man). In addition to these 18 titles, you also receive the IREM Arcade 1 cartridge collection, which features a further six classic arcade titles like R-Type.</p><p> Evercase EXP features a 1.5 GHz processor, 4GB of built-in memory, and stereo speakers. It has built-in Wi-Fi, and you’ll find a USB-C charging port as well as a 720p Mini HDMI output, should you ever want to hook it up to your TV. On the downside, battery life is only OK, with a meager five hours of game time on a full charge.</p><p> With the IREM Arcade collection fully supported, there are over 30 classic arcade collections currently available, featuring 380 retro games. For gamers who grew up in the 80s, this is a great place to re-live those giddy gaming delights of your youth. You can bathe in the nostalgia of opening a brand-new game box and slotting the pristine cartridge into the back of your console. It feels authentic and satisfying.</p><p> An additional feature here is Tate Mode, which allows the console to be turned 90 degrees and played in portrait mode, making it ideal for retro vertical scrollers like 1942 or Atari’s Centipede. With over five decades worth of classic titles available, and a relatively affordable price point, the Evercade EXP is a great way for retro gamers to indulge themselves in all those button-mashing memories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/retroid-pocket-3-plus.jpg"                      alt="Retroid Pocket 3 Plus"                ></p><p>Best for Android</p><h5 id="Retroid-Pocket-3-1"><a href="#Retroid-Pocket-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Retroid Pocket 3+"></a>Retroid Pocket 3+</h5><p> A portable game console for all your retro favorites</p><p> The Retroid Pocket 3 Plus is a lightweight gaming handheld that offers portable retro gaming and supports multiple emulators.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Android and retro games on the go</li><li>Supports a wide array of emulators</li><li>Integrated rumble motor</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Screen is on the small side</li><li>Battery life is OK but not great</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Retroid-Pocket-Handheld-Multiple-Emulators/dp/B0BR3VCWBG?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2016666&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-modern-retro-consoles/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/retroid-Pocket-3-Plus-Retro-Game-Console-Android-11-WI-FI-Multiple-Emulators-Handheld-4-7-Inch-Display-4500mAh-Battery-4GB-LPDDR4x-128GB-eMMC-Black/1283058214" >$215 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> One of the cheaper options for retro game emulation is the Retroid Pocket 3 Plus. It runs on the Android 11 OS, which offers full support for the Google Play Store. And while it comes without any games pre-installed, it can emulate classic game consoles like the PlayStation 2 and GameCube.</p><p> It has a 4.7-inch IPS touchscreen with 1334 x 750 resolution and comes pre-loaded with several emulation and game-streaming apps to get you started. It offers a significant upgrade compared to the Retroid Pocket 3, with more RAM and internal storage, as well as a bigger battery and improved emulation performance.</p><p> There is a micro-HDMI port for easy hook-up to a TV or monitor if you want to enjoy bigger-screen gaming, since the IPS touchscreen is on the small side. Similar in price and size to the Nintendo Switch Lite, the Retroid Pocket 3 is perhaps the more obvious choice if you’re looking for a dedicated retro gaming handheld.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SEGA-Genesis-Mini-2.jpg"                      alt="SEGA Genesis Mini 2"                ></p><p>Best for 90s Kids</p><h5 id="SEGA-Genesis-Mini-2-1"><a href="#SEGA-Genesis-Mini-2-1" class="headerlink" title="SEGA Genesis Mini 2"></a>SEGA Genesis Mini 2</h5><p>Sixty SEGA classics under one roof</p><p> The SEGA Genesis Mini 2 includes 60 classic titles for the ultimate in gaming nostalgia.

Spawning a legion of classic titles, it was a runaway success for SEGA. And hot on the heels of the SEGA Genesis Mini, is the SEGA Genesis Mini 2, which launched in 2022. This miniature marvel allows you to enjoy those classic games all over again, while you wax lyrical to your kids about how they don’t make ‘em like this anymore.</p><p> This version comes with one wired control pad, a USB power adapter, a power cable, and an HDMI cable, as well as a whopping 60 games pre-loaded. This list includes SEGA Genesis titles such as Sonic 3D Blast, Streets of Rage 3, and Super Street Fighter II, as well as 12 SEGA CD titles, including Ecco the Dolphin.</p><p> For nostalgia fans and retro game enthusiasts, this mini console is a real treat. There are arguably a few classics missing from the list, and it certainly could have used an extra controller in this pack, especially with many two-player titles included. However, it’s an enjoyable walk down memory lane. And once that second controller has been procured, it provides a great way to settle old scores, and set new ones!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014850/22899" target="_top" id="2014850">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014850" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014850/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Finding-the-Right-Retro-Console-for-You"><a href="#Finding-the-Right-Retro-Console-for-You" class="headerlink" title="Finding the Right Retro Console for You"></a>Finding the Right Retro Console for You</h2><p> Retro gaming will likely mean something different to each one of us. It depends on when you grew up, and what you played back then, too. Whether you’ve always been a solo gamer, or if you preferred frantic two-player action growing up, your retro might not be your neighbor’s retro.</p><p> Luckily, there’s space to accommodate everyone, no matter whether you’re a fan of Nintendo, SEGA, PlayStation, or Xbox.</p><p> Sophisticated modern-day handheld PCs like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally provide gamers with a great way to indulge in retro gaming, due to their versatility. Being compatible with many different emulators, they can easily unlock a path to your favorite retro games, and allow you to enjoy them wherever you go.</p><p> If you prefer a more authentically retro experience, you might prefer to check out some of the mini retro consoles out there instead. With the PlayStation Classic or the SNES Classic Mini, you can recreate the experience of huddling around the TV at home for your gaming fix. By replicating the look and feel of the original consoles too, you might consider that these provide a more rounded retro experience that appeals on different levels.</p><p> However, if you want to kill two birds with one stone, and enjoy retro gameplay alongside some more modern titles, the Nintendo Switch OLED is an excellent choice. Its stunning OLED screen frames your gameplay beautifully in handheld and tabletop modes, and it can of course be docked for a big screen experience too.</p><p> Although not the cheapest option out there, you’ll save some money compared to the latest handheld PCs. And while you might not be able to enjoy the latest AAA titles on it, you can, of course, sink hours into the latest Nintendo ones instead, like the epic Tears of the Kingdom. Plus, using the Nintendo Switch Online Services, there’s an endless amount of retro joy to be unlocked. You’ll find a huge library of NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and even SEGA Genesis titles available to download and relive.</p><p> In terms of screen size, graphical quality, sound, and versatility, the Switch OLED has got the competition licked. And being priced around the mid-range, you might not mind the sting of forking out for the additional subscription. Particularly when it provides access to more classic retro games than you can shake a stick at.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Switch-OLED.jpg"                      alt="Switch OLED"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137973/21526" target="_top" id="2137973">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137973" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137973/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Best Overall</p><h5 id="Nintendo-Switch-OLED-2"><a href="#Nintendo-Switch-OLED-2" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo Switch OLED"></a>Nintendo Switch OLED</h5><p> Enjoy your favorite Nintendo classics in handheld, tabletop, or docked modes.</p><p> With a larger, seven-inch OLED touchscreen and the ability to play your games in handheld or docked mode, the Nintendo Switch OLED is a great way to enjoy your favorite Nintendo retro classics. 64GB of internal storage should be more than enough to house all the retro games you can handle.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent quality screen in handheld mode</li><li>Excellent audio</li><li>Large range of retro games available online</li><li>Improved internal storage</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Online subscription required for access to retro titles</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Neon-Joy/dp/B098RL6SBJ?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2016666&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-modern-retro-consoles/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$340 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-oled-model-w-white-joy-con-white/6470923.p?skuId=6470923" >$350 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Sw-Oled-Model-w-White-Joy-Con/3835757820" >See at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-incorporating-creative-effects-into-your-zoom-meetings-step-by-step/"><u>[New] Incorporating Creative Effects Into Your Zoom Meetings Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-video-editing-inshots-place/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Video Editing -

Which makes it very frustrating when this feature doesn’t work, and produces cloud sync errors.

It’s likely that the cause is somewhere on Steam’s side, which leaves the user without any permanent fixes.</p><p> However, it’s still possible to temporarily fix this issue, and get on with your gaming session.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144272/7443" target="_top" id="2144272">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144272" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144272/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Reconnect-the-Wi-Fi"><a href="#1-Reconnect-the-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="1.

GameSir, Redgear, and Motorola are all examples of high-quality game controllers that you can use with your Android device. Android phones and tablets are both able to sync with controllers through Bluetooth or USB connections.</p><p> In a moment, we’ll look at each kind of controller in turn. Note that we’re skipping older console controllers (such as the Xbox 360 controller) due to out-of-date apps and changes to Android’s Bluetooth support. Generic controllers designed for use with a PC may not work, either. Lastly, the controller won’t work if the game you’re playing doesn’t have controller support built-in. You can sometimes circumvent this by mapping the controls with a third-party Android game controller app.</p><p>Let’s examine how to set up a game controller on Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Connect-a-Wired-USB-Controller-to-Android"><a href="#How-to-Connect-a-Wired-USB-Controller-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Connect a Wired USB Controller to Android"></a>How to Connect a Wired USB Controller to Android</h2><p> If you want to play games on Android with a USB controller, you’ll need a USB OTG cable. This is a special tool that adapts a standard USB connector to fit in your phone or tablet.</p><p> However, the OTG-USB cable does more than that, even letting you connect all manner of USB devices and drives to Android—controllers too! Our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-usb-otg-5-cool-ways-use-android/" >guide to USB-OTG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> explains this in more detail.</p><p> You’ll first need to purchase a<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01COOQIKU?tag=muo-v2-7566rso-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU35996&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-a-game-controller-to-android-for-console-like-gameplay-si/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >USB OTG cable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . They’re available for cheap from Amazon. Make sure you choose a USB-C or micro-USB connector depending on what your phone uses.</p><p> Once you have a USB OTG adapter, just plug it into your Android phone, and connect the USB game controller to the other end of the adapter. Next, open the game you want to play. Games with controller support should detect the device, and you’ll be ready to play.</p><h2 id="Connect-a-Standard-Bluetooth-Controller-to-Android"><a href="#Connect-a-Standard-Bluetooth-Controller-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Connect a Standard Bluetooth Controller to Android"></a>Connect a Standard Bluetooth Controller to Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/muo-android-steamlink-strider-2022.jpg"                      alt="Play games on Android with a controller"                ></p><p> If you have a generic Bluetooth game controller, you’re almost guaranteed that it will work with your Android device. It’s nearly as simple as connecting a USB controller, although of course, you won’t need any special adapters.</p><p> Start by making sure your phone is discoverable by Bluetooth devices. Open <strong>Settings &gt; Connected devices &gt; Connection preferences &gt; Bluetooth</strong> and make sure Bluetooth is enabled.</p><p> From the same menu, select<strong>Pair new device</strong> , then follow the specific instructions to make your controller discoverable. Look for a dedicated Bluetooth button, or check the manual for the right button combination if there isn’t one. (If you usually have Bluetooth enabled anyway, you can simply go to<strong>Settings &gt; Connected devices &gt; Pair new device</strong> .)</p><p> Your phone should detect the controller; tap its name to establish the connection. As with USB, games that can use controllers will detect them when you start the game. Other games might support controllers, but require additional software from Google Play.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-Connect-an-Xbox-One-or-Xbox-Series-X-and-S-Controller-to-Android"><a href="#Can-You-Connect-an-Xbox-One-or-Xbox-Series-X-and-S-Controller-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Can You Connect an Xbox One or Xbox Series X and S Controller to Android?"></a>Can You Connect an Xbox One or Xbox Series X and S Controller to Android?</h2><p> Whether you’ve got an<a class="link"   href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-White-one/dp/B01GW3H3U8?tag=muo-v2-7566rso-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU35996&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-a-game-controller-to-android-for-console-like-gameplay-si/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Xbox One controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Pulse-Red-Windows-Devices/dp/B088GJR4B9?tag=muo-v2-7566rso-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU35996&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-connect-a-game-controller-to-android-for-console-like-gameplay-si/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> know that you’ve already got a fantastic way to control Android games.

A typical Android device’s Bluetooth support is all you need to connect the controller to your phone or tablet.</p><p> Before starting, make sure the controller is fully charged, and you’ve unplugged your Xbox One or Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller. If you don’t, the controller will remain paired to it, which means you can’t pair it with your Android device.</p><p> Begin by putting Android into discoverable mode as explained in the previous section. Next, hold the<strong>Sync</strong> button on the Xbox One or Xbox Series X&#x2F;S controller. Upon detection, select the controller on your phone and follow the instructions to pair.</p><p> Original Xbox One controllers connect using RF rather than Bluetooth. To connect Xbox One controllers that use an RF connection, use a USB charging cable to connect to your Android device via USB OTG instead.</p><h2 id="Connect-a-PS5-or-PS4-Controller-to-Android"><a href="#Connect-a-PS5-or-PS4-Controller-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Connect a PS5 or PS4 Controller to Android"></a>Connect a PS5 or PS4 Controller to Android</h2><p> Sony has used Bluetooth in its controllers for years, which makes it easy if you want to play Android games with a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 gamepad. The instructions are the same for both consoles since they both use Bluetooth.</p><p> Make your Android device discoverable, then sync the controller by holding the<strong>PlayStation</strong> and<strong>Share</strong> buttons simultaneously. When the controller light flashes, you should see a<strong>Wireless Controller</strong> entry listed on your Android device.</p><p> Select this to complete pairing. Your phone or tablet will then ask you to confirm the pairing, so do that, and you’re done! A solid light on the PlayStation controller means that it’s successfully connected.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Play-Games-on-Android-With-Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Con"><a href="#Play-Games-on-Android-With-Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Con" class="headerlink" title="Play Games on Android With Nintendo Switch Joy-Con"></a>Play Games on Android With Nintendo Switch Joy-Con</h2><p> You can also hook up a Nintendo Switch controller to your mobile Android device.

For most people, just ignoring a game is easy enough—you can just go about your gaming schedule and ignore it. But sometimes, you just want a game gone.</p><p> We’ll look at how you can permanently remove a game from your Steam. Also, we’ll show you a couple of alternatives to removing a game in case you change your mind.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Remove-a-Game-From-Your-Steam-Library"><a href="#How-to-Remove-a-Game-From-Your-Steam-Library" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove a Game From Your Steam Library"></a>How to Remove a Game From Your Steam Library</h2><p> Before removing a game, check if you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-a-game-on-steam/" >get a refund from Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You can get a refund if you’ve played the game for less than two hours and no more than two weeks have passed since the purchase. But if this is not the case, here’s how to remove the game from your Steam library.</p><p> First, you should uninstall the game using the Steam app. Otherwise, you’ll have to manually uninstall it from your computer once you remove it from your Steam account.</p><p> Then, go to the game in your Library and click on the game you want to remove. On the right side of the game’s page, click the<strong>Support</strong> link. This will take you to the game’s support page, where there are all kinds of options for issues with a game. The important one for our needs is at the very bottom.</p><p> Click the button labeled<strong>I want to permanently remove this game from my account</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/remove-game-1.jpg"                      alt="Remove a Steam game from library"                ></p><p> A page will launch asking you to confirm your choice, and then it will be gone forever.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/remove-game-2.jpg"                      alt="Remove a Steam game from library"                ></p><p> Just remember that you’ll need to repurchase the game if you change your mind down the road. Also, bonus and downloadable content will be removed along with the main game, so you should really think this through.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-to-Removing-a-Steam-Game"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Removing-a-Steam-Game" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Removing a Steam Game"></a>Alternatives to Removing a Steam Game</h2><p> There are a few reasons why you might want to remove a game from your library. Maybe a game’s content is inappropriate for a younger family member, or you’re playing a silly game you don’t want your friends and family to learn about.</p><p> Whatever your reason, permanently removing a game from your library may be a bit too much sometimes. Fortunately, there are a couple of ways to keep the game away from curious eyes and hands.</p><h3 id="Hide-Steam-Games"><a href="#Hide-Steam-Games" class="headerlink" title="Hide Steam Games"></a>Hide Steam Games</h3><p> If you don’t want anyone to find a particular game on your Steam library, you should hide it. Once you launch the app, select the game you want to hide and click the<strong>Settings</strong> icon. Then, click<strong>Manage &gt; Hide this game</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hide-steam-game-1-1.jpg"                      alt="Hide a Steam game from library"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2052060/7443" target="_top" id="2052060">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2052060" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2052060/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can hide any game on your Steam account, including installed or uninstalled games. Also, you can hide the single or multiplayer version of the same game.</p><p> To access a hidden game, open the<strong>View</strong> menu and click<strong>View hidden games</strong> .

Now, if you have a game in your library that you still want to play sometime in the future,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-uninstall-steam-games-reinstall/" >you can uninstall that Steam game and reinstall it later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Share-Your-Games"><a href="#Share-Your-Games" class="headerlink" title="Share Your Games"></a>Share Your Games</h3><p> Before removing a game from your Steam account, ask your friends if they wouldn’t want to play it. With the Steam Family Sharing feature, they can play games from your library without having to pay.</p><p>Here’s how you can share your Steam games:</p><ol><li>Log into your Steam account on your friend’s computer.</li><li>Open the<strong>Steam</strong> menu and go to<strong>Settings &gt; Family</strong> .</li><li>Turn on the toggle next to<strong>Authorize Library Sharing on this Computer</strong> .</li><li>Authorize your friend’s account.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-family-sharing-1.jpg"                      alt="Share your Steam games with friends"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now you can authorize your friend’s account if they logged into using the same computer. If they didn’t, you’ll get the “No other local accounts found” message.</p><p> Once you add their account, log out of your Steam account. Then, once your friend logs back in, your Steam library titles should be available to download and install.</p><h2 id="Can-You-Sell-Your-Steam-Games"><a href="#Can-You-Sell-Your-Steam-Games" class="headerlink" title="Can You Sell Your Steam Games?"></a>Can You Sell Your Steam Games?</h2><p> Unfortunately, Steam doesn’t allow you to sell games from your library. So, the next time you have to choose between<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/physical-games-vs-digital-games-best-to-buy/" >physical games or digital games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the first option might be better, if you’ve got a physical edition of a PC game that you can sell (i.e one without a unique, one-time download code). At least, there’s no one stopping you from selling the games you’re no longer playing.</p><p> However, you can still get some of your money back for your Steam games. On the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/beginners-guide-to-the-steam-community-market/" >Steam Community Market <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can sell in-game items such as inventory pieces, trading cards, profile wallpapers, and so on. The rarer an item is, the more money you can get for it.</p><p> However, you should know that you can only spend the earned money to buy Steam games or other items from the marketplace.</p><h2 id="Clear-Your-Steam-Library"><a href="#Clear-Your-Steam-Library" class="headerlink" title="Clear Your Steam Library"></a>Clear Your Steam Library</h2><p> Hopefully, you got rid of the games that you no longer play and do nothing but clutter your library. Also, the other three options might give you a hand when it comes to organizing your game list.</p><p> Now that you’ve cleaned up your Steam library, you can add a few more games without spending too much money. You can wait for the Steam summer sale, have Steam email you about a game sale, or buy titles from a partner store. Also, there are plenty of free games available on Steam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-explore-our-12-tycoon-classics-for-engrossing-experiences/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Explore Our #12 Tycoon Classics for Engrossing Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-directing-content-destination-from-imovie-files-to-youtube-platform/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Directing Content Destination From iMovie Files To YouTube Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-haul-videography-unlocked-step-by-step-guide-for-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Haul Videography Unlocked Step-by-Step Guide for Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-avoiding-common-mistakes-in-macos-mixer-streaming/"><u>2024 Approved Avoiding Common Mistakes in MacOS Mixer Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/24-techniques-for-recording-virtual-conferences-on-a-dime/"><u>24 Techniques for Recording Virtual Conferences on a Dime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/asus-proart-hdr-master-the-4k-quest-continues/"><u>ASUS ProArt HDR Master The 4K Quest Continues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/decoding-display-dilemmnas-why-you-shouldnt-splurge-on-hdr/"><u>Decoding Display Dilemmnas: Why You Shouldn't Splurge on HDR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/efficiently-navigate-away-from-dead-end-gpt-tools/"><u>Efficiently Navigate Away From Dead-End GPT Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/having-playstation-4-wi-fi-issues-8-tips-and-fixes-worth-trying/"><u>Having PlayStation 4 Wi-Fi Issues? 8 Tips and Fixes Worth Trying</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ifa-2023s-innovative-devices-a-gamers-paradise/"><u>IFA 2023'S Innovative Devices – A Gamer's Paradise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-comprehensive-guide-to-producing-videos-for-social-media/"><u>In 2024, A Comprehensive Guide to Producing Videos For Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-vivo-s17t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Vivo S17t | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/is-switchs-connectivity-upgrade-worth-the-dollar/"><u>Is Switch's Connectivity Upgrade Worth the Dollar?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/overcoming-the-challenge-error-code-262-on-roblox/"><u>Overcoming the Challenge: Error Code 262 on Roblox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/reinventing-identity-the-process-for-name-and-logo-change-on-riot-games/"><u>Reinventing Identity: The Process for Name and Logo Change on Riot Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steps-to-remedy-errors-in-oculus-application-on-win-1011/"><u>Steps To Remedy Errors in Oculus Application on Win 10/11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unmatched-performance-and-precision-razers-basilisk-v3-pro-review/"><u>Unmatched Performance and Precision: Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Similar to CPU throttling, GPU throttling leads to random FPS drops, lag spikes, artifacts, screen tearing, and other issues when gaming as your hardware struggles to keep up with the in-game processing requirements.</p><p> With the right custom fan curve settings, however, you can flip that around and have a cooler GPU that uses its full potential instead of slowing down, keeping your gameplay at its maximum potential.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/11/applying-thermal-paste-on-gpu-die.JPG"                      alt="Applying thermal paste on GPU die"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> If you’re trying to get the lowest GPU temperatures and the most performance for your graphics card, you might also want to check out<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-reapply-thermal-paste-graphics-card/" >how to replace your graphics card’s thermal paste <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-undervolt-graphics-card/" >undervolt your graphics card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Should-Your-GPU-Fans-Run-at-100"><a href="#Should-Your-GPU-Fans-Run-at-100" class="headerlink" title="Should Your GPU Fans Run at 100%?"></a>Should Your GPU Fans Run at 100%?</h2><p> If you run your GPU fans at 100%, they will wear out quicker than normal.

If you want to maintain a stable gameplay experience, here are a few checks and fixes to try.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Perform-Some-Preliminary-Checks"><a href="#1-Perform-Some-Preliminary-Checks" class="headerlink" title="1. Perform Some Preliminary Checks"></a>1. Perform Some Preliminary Checks</h2><p> Perform the following preliminary checks before moving on to major fixes:</p><ul><li>Restart Rust after closing the error window.</li><li>Restart Steam to resolve potential problems with the gaming client.</li><li>Whitelist Rust from Windows Defender to ensure that your security does not interfere with the game’s connection. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/" >how to allow apps through Windows Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Opt out of the Steam beta programs you’re currently subscribed to. To do this, navigate to<strong>Steam &gt; Settings</strong> , go to the<strong>Account</strong> tab, then click the<strong>Change</strong> button. After that, click<strong>None - Opt. out of all beta programs</strong> .</li></ul><p> If none of the above checks resolve the problem, apply the remaining fixes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Ensure-the-Rust-and-Steam-Servers-Aren’t-Down"><a href="#2-Ensure-the-Rust-and-Steam-Servers-Aren’t-Down" class="headerlink" title="2.

Ensure the Rust and Steam Servers Aren’t Down</h2><p> The “Steam Auth Timeout” error occurs when the connection between the Steam client and Rust servers encounters an issue. Therefore, it’s a good idea to double-check that both servers are operating normally before you start tweaking stuff on your computer.</p><p> Go to the<a class="link"   href="https://downoutages.com/" >Down Outages website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , search for**”Rust”** and**”Steam”** in the top right corner, and hit<strong>Enter</strong> . If there are numerous outages reported, there is probably a backend problem. In that case, you should only wait for the developers to resolve the issue. If you don’t see any reports suggesting this error is unique to you, it’s time to start tweaking settings on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-5.jpg"                      alt="Check the Status of Steam on the Down Outages Official Website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Steam and Rust mostly announce maintenance downtimes on their Twitter accounts.

If Rust throws the “Steam Auth Timeout” error when you launch it, the download cache is most likely causing the issue. Therefore, you should clear the download cache by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Launch Steam.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Steam</strong> menu and select<strong>Settings</strong> .</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Downloads</strong> tab in the left sidebar.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Clear Download Cache</strong> button.

You can rule out corruption issues by verifying the integrity of game files using Steam’s built-in feature. So, repair the game files to ensure they aren’t causing the problem. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Right-click the Rust game icon and select<strong>Properties</strong> .</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Local Files</strong> tab on the left.</li><li>Click the<strong>Verify integrity of game files</strong> button to repair the game files.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/verify-integrity-of-game-files-in-steam.jpg"                      alt="Verify Integrity of Game Files in Steam"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Disable-the-Cheat-Software-and-Repair-the-Easy-Anti-Cheat-Program"><a href="#7-Disable-the-Cheat-Software-and-Repair-the-Easy-Anti-Cheat-Program" class="headerlink" title="7.

Disable the Cheat Software and Repair the Easy Anti-Cheat Program</h2><p> Using cheat software can also cause Rust to crash and present the “Steam Auth Timeout” error. Therefore, if you currently use such software to gain an advantage in the game, you should turn it off or uninstall it. Also, you should turn off any other cheat software running on your device, even those unrelated to Rust.</p><p> Repairing the Easy Anti-Cheat software has also fixed the issue for some users who have encountered the error. Given the possibility that this step could resolve the issue, follow the below steps to repair the application:</p><ol><li>Go to the installation folder of the game.</li><li>Locate the EasyAntiCheat folder.</li><li>Open the folder and double-click<strong>EasyAntiCheat.exe</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Rust</strong> from the dropdown menu if it isn’t already selected.</li><li>Click<strong>Repair Service</strong> and let the software be fully repaired.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/easy-anticheat-software.jpg"                      alt="Repairing the Easy Anti-Cheat Service on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> If that doesn’t work, you can uninstall Rust and reinstall it from the ground up.</p><h2 id="8-Uninstall-Rust-and-Reinstall-It"><a href="#8-Uninstall-Rust-and-Reinstall-It" class="headerlink" title="8. Uninstall Rust and Reinstall It"></a>8. Uninstall Rust and Reinstall It</h2><p> If none of the above fixes work, the problem could be with the game’s installation itself. To make sure this isn’t the case, you should uninstall Rust and reinstall it from scratch. If you’re not familiar with the process, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-uninstall-steam-games-reinstall/" >how to uninstall Steam games and reinstall them fresh <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Don’t worry; you won’t have to pay for the game again if you uninstall it. Since all the games you buy remain anchored to your Steam account, you can reinstall them whenever you want to.</p><h2 id="Steam-Auth-Timeout-Error-Resolved"><a href="#Steam-Auth-Timeout-Error-Resolved" class="headerlink" title="Steam Auth Timeout Error, Resolved"></a>Steam Auth Timeout Error, Resolved</h2><p> When Rust refuses to let you join a game, kicks you out in the middle of a crucial moment, and displays the “Steam Auth Timeout” error, it can be highly annoying. Hopefully, you now better understand what causes this error and what fixes you can apply. If the problem persists, reinstall the game and Steam client from scratch.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-photoshop-curves-decoded-a-beginners-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Photoshop Curves Decoded A Beginner's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/content-creation-showdown-twitch-versus-youtube-explored-for-2024/"><u>Content Creation Showdown Twitch Versus YouTube Explored for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/display-showdown-determining-which-is-superior-oled-or-ips/"><u>Display Showdown: Determining Which Is Superior, OLED or IPS?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/diy-photography-hack-the-complete-strategy-for-effective-selfie-light-usage/"><u>DIY Photography Hack: The Complete Strategy for Effective Selfie Light Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/dynamic-cooling-design-maximizes-graphics-output-speed/"><u>Dynamic Cooling Design Maximizes Graphics Output Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-gameplay-essential-tips-to-improve-your-ps4/"><u>Enhance Gameplay: Essential Tips to Improve Your PS4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/essential-info-processing-refunds-from-xbox-games/"><u>Essential Info: Processing Refunds From Xbox Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/expert-picks-top-karaoke-equipment-that-defined-2024/"><u>Expert Picks: Top Karaoke Equipment That Defined 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-together-dual-gameplay-in-minecraft-switch-edition/"><u>Exploring Together: Dual Gameplay in Minecraft Switch Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-redeem-digital-direct-offers-on-your-xbox-series-xs/"><u>How to Redeem Digital Direct Offers on Your Xbox Series X|S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-vivo-y36i-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Most-Known Ways to Find Someone on Tinder For Vivo Y36i by Name | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-anti-tracker-software-for-vivo-y100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Anti Tracker Software For Vivo Y100 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-your-vivo-v30-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror Your Vivo V30 Screen to PC with Chromecast | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-iphone-photography-mastery-of-macro-and-close-up-details/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting iPhone Photography Mastery of Macro and Close-Up Details</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/ios-18-rollout-introduces-major-improvements-to-home-interface-and-mail-app-features-discover-how/"><u>IOS 18 Rollout Introduces Major Improvements to Home Interface and Mail App Features – Discover How!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/premium-monitors-at-144hz-for-enhanced-gameplay/"><u>Premium Monitors at 144Hz for Enhanced Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-selection-of-best-2024-motherboards-for-gamers-based-on-sockets-and-chipsets/"><u>The Ultimate Selection of Best 2024 Motherboards for Gamers Based on Sockets & Chipsets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/twitch-demystified-essential-knowledge-for-aspiring-streamers/"><u>Twitch Demystified: Essential Knowledge for Aspiring Streamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/warriors-choice-the-creme-de-la-creme-of-online-fps-games/"><u>Warrior's Choice: The Crème De La Créme of Online FPS Games</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While many are fun and absolutely worth your money, they come with some drawbacks that could prevent you from enjoying your time completely.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Early-Access"><a href="#What-Is-Early-Access" class="headerlink" title="What Is Early Access?"></a>What Is Early Access?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/early-access-section-on-steam-game.JPG"                      alt="Early Access section on Steam game"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Early access games are games that are released before the publishers or developers think it is ready for its official release.</p><p> The reason for this is mostly to gain additional funding from interested players so that the game can continue to be developed. It’s also a great way for players to give feedback, test the game for bugs and problems, and have a hand in the transformation of the game as it approaches its official release.</p><p> Every game goes through a development process, through many versions that could be wildly different to the final version of the game. Some games will begin early access close to a finished state, while some you can play at very early stages with still a lot of work to do.</p><p> Steam is one of the most popular platforms to get early access to many games, but you can also get<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-participate-in-xbox-research-for-xbox-series-xs/" >early access for Xbox games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even Google Play.</p><h2 id="Pro-Contributing-to-the-Development-of-the-Game"><a href="#Pro-Contributing-to-the-Development-of-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Contributing to the Development of the Game"></a>Pro: Contributing to the Development of the Game</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dinkum-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="Dinkum gameplay"                ></p><p> Early access games usually allow players to have an active role in how the game transforms. Players can often join Discord servers where the developers are easily accessible and their concerns, feedback, bug reports, and suggestions can all be taken seriously.</p><p> My favorite example of this is Dinkum. It’s a farm builder similar to Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, but with a lot of Australian personality. It’s developed by one person and it has a busy and active Discord server where your concerns can be seen directly by the developer.</p><p> Dinkum has grown to be an awesome game and it is partially thanks to early access. It not only gained funding, but also real player testing and feedback.</p><h2 id="Con-The-Game-Might-Be-in-Early-Access-Limbo"><a href="#Con-The-Game-Might-Be-in-Early-Access-Limbo" class="headerlink" title="Con: The Game Might Be in Early Access Limbo"></a>Con: The Game Might Be in Early Access Limbo</h2><p> Some games take forever to reach their official release stage. BeamNG.drive is one example that’s been in early access since 2015. Of course, the game has transformed so much since its early days that it’s starting to be recognized as one of the best rally simulators, but the game itself is still very reliant on community-created mods, maps, cars, and plugins.</p><p> It’s more like a racing simulator sandbox than a standalone game that you can enjoy without downloading anything else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Buggy"><a href="#Con-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Buggy" class="headerlink" title="Con: Early Access Games Are Usually Buggy"></a>Con: Early Access Games Are Usually Buggy</h2><p> Of course, releasing a game that isn’t ready for official release is going to have problems. Depending on how far along the game is, you could experience game-breaking bugs, performance issues, and inconveniences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/valheim-store-page-on-steam.png"                      alt="valheim store page on steam"                ></p><p> Valheim was released in a pretty early state. While you were able to complete the game, there were many features that the developers still wanted to implement. The building mechanics were frustrating and limiting, and the spider biome was still completely empty. My friends and I also faced frequent crashes and connection issues despite having no connection issues on any of our computers.</p><p> Despite those issues, it was still a wonderfully fun game that we put 90 hours into within just a week and we only looked forward to how the game would improve over time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pro-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Cheaper"><a href="#Pro-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Cheaper" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Early Access Games Are Usually Cheaper"></a>Pro: Early Access Games Are Usually Cheaper</h2><p> While it’s not always the case, there have been many times where early access prices are lower than the release price.</p><p> Developers often won’t justify putting up a high price for a game that’s still not complete, so in exchange for your early investment into their project, you’ll pay a lower price. Early access players will sometimes even be given special items or cosmetics to signify their support for the game before its release.</p><p> However, there are cases where the price goes down after release. This could be to gain more sales, or because early access players have given feedback about the price. Either way the price goes, you should only buy it if you think it’s worth it.</p><p> Thankfully<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-a-game-on-steam/" >Steam refunds are pretty easy to do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ; so long as your playtime is less than 2 hours or you’ve owned the game for less than 14 days, you can refund it.</p><h2 id="Con-Incomplete-Story-World-Mechanics"><a href="#Con-Incomplete-Story-World-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Con: Incomplete Story&#x2F;World&#x2F;Mechanics"></a>Con: Incomplete Story&#x2F;World&#x2F;Mechanics</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/wide-view-of-palworld-world.jpg"                      alt="Wide view of Palworld world"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880972/19272" target="_top" id="1880972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880972/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If the game was ready to go, it wouldn’t be in early access now would it? You’re very likely to experience many features missing, from plots, places, or even whole mechanics.</p><p> Palworld is a great example of that. It was released and became a massive success, but only had the bare essentials. There were just a few small islands to roam around, repetitive elements, missing bosses, and a lot of in-progress features.</p><p> You’re often left waiting until the updates roll out to get more of what you were promised. This is usually why games like Palworld have a very steep drop in player count after a few weeks. Without many of the features that would’ve kept players busy and having fun, it’s easy to feel like there’s nothing more to the game except waiting for future updates.</p><h2 id="Pro-Experiencing-the-Game’s-Transformation"><a href="#Pro-Experiencing-the-Game’s-Transformation" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Experiencing the Game’s Transformation"></a>Pro: Experiencing the Game’s Transformation</h2><p> While you should know that you’re paying for something that’s incomplete, it should still be worth it if you enjoy it.</p><p> It’s always very exciting to hear about a huge update coming to the games you enjoy, adding whole new ways to play the game, story progression, or even whole new worlds. It’s almost as if you’re getting a new game without needing to pay anymore. It’s also partially thanks to your purchase and contribution that the game is able to progress.</p><p> Rust, Valheim, BeamNG.drive, Baldur’s Gate 3, and other games have transformed so much since their first early access release. Of course, games can still drastically change over time even after official release, but when it comes to early access, you get to see that on a faster time scale.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-The-Game-May-Become-Unrecognizable"><a href="#Con-The-Game-May-Become-Unrecognizable" class="headerlink" title="Con: The Game May Become Unrecognizable"></a>Con: The Game May Become Unrecognizable</h2><p> A game’s transformation may be a blessing or a curse depending on what you’re looking for and what the publishers and developers eventually decide to do. Some games may end up greedier than they started off, with way more microtransactions added to the game or even just a change in direction.</p><p> The game you used to enjoy playing might be completely different in a bad way and not what you paid for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-Risk-of-Abandonment"><a href="#Con-Risk-of-Abandonment" class="headerlink" title="Con: Risk of Abandonment"></a>Con: Risk of Abandonment</h2><p> While officially released games do get abandoned, the risk of abandonment for early access games is a bit higher. There are many reasons for this, but there are a few red flags to watch out for.</p><p> If a game releases in early access as a last-ditch effort to get funding, it’s already at a very high risk of getting abandoned, especially if not many buy the game. Indie releases with solo developers also get abandoned pretty often because it’s hard to live off of a game unless it’s a massive success.</p><p> However, there are also green flags to watch out for if you want to know if the risk is low: busy communities, developers constantly talking about and delivering updates, clear development roadmaps, and of course, popularity with lots of players buying the game.</p><p> With more and more games opting to go early access, you should always keep in mind if it’s worth its price or not. Ask yourself if you would pay the amount they’re asking for despite the game not being in its best state, whether it’s worth waiting for those updates, or if you can afford to lose what you spent. What matters the most is that you enjoy what you paid for.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-unearthing-your-private-playlist-sanctuary-on-youtube/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unearthing Your Private Playlist Sanctuary on Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-messaging-tools-beyond-discord/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Messaging Tools Beyond Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/expertly-crafted-logitech-gamer-mouse/"><u>Expertly Crafted Logitech Gamer Mouse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/geforce-nows-latest-pass-does-it-justify-excitement/"><u>GeForce Now's Latest Pass: Does It Justify Excitement?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/handheld-optimization-unveiled-x-ally-leads-way/"><u>Handheld Optimization Unveiled, X-Ally Leads Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-phone-touchscreen-of-vivo-s17e-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Phone Touchscreen Of Vivo S17e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-infinix-hot-40i-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Infinix Hot 40i to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/how-to-successfully-download-and-setup-epson-et-4550-printer-driver-on-your-windows-machine/"><u>How to Successfully Download and Setup Epson ET-4550 Printer Driver on Your Windows Machine</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-honor-magic-5-lite-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Honor Magic 5 Lite Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/restoring-full-volume-in-partially-muted-fb-content-for-2024/"><u>Restoring Full Volume in Partially Muted FB Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/restoring-gaming-joy-with-non-responsive-controllers-on-windows/"><u>Restoring Gaming Joy with Non-Responsive Controllers on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/the-best-of-the-best-top-facebook-memes-to-find/"><u>The Best of the Best – Top Facebook Memes to Find</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-viewing-the-matrix-series-sequentially/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Viewing The Matrix Series Sequentially</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/what-are-foddian-games-and-whats-the-origin-of-the-name/"><u>What Are Foddian Games, and What's the Origin of the Name?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-for-a-High-Flying-PS4-Experience"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-for-a-High-Flying-PS4-Experience" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide for a High-Flying PS4 Experience"></a>The Ultimate Guide for a High-Flying PS4 Experience</h2><p> If you have a PS4 or even a PS4 Pro, you might wonder how to get better performance out of your system. And while you can’t upgrade your PS4 like you can a gaming PC, there are some ways to make sure your PS4 runs at its best.</p><p> Let’s look at your options for how to make your PS4 run faster and what to expect from them.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Make-Sure-You-Have-Enough-Free-Disk-Space"><a href="#1-Make-Sure-You-Have-Enough-Free-Disk-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Make Sure You Have Enough Free Disk Space"></a>1. Make Sure You Have Enough Free Disk Space</h2><p> One of the most common causes of poor PS4 performance is running critically low on disk space. With the size of modern games, plus video captures you’ve saved, it’s easy to fill up your available space and not even realize it.</p><p> To see what’s taking up space on your PS4, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Storage &gt; System Storage</strong> and you’ll see a bar broken down by category. Chances are that games are the biggest space hogs, so select<strong>Applications</strong> to show the list of what’s installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PS4-Storage-Screen.jpg"                      alt="PS4 Storage Screen"                ></p><p> Next, it makes sense to hit<strong>Options</strong> and choose<strong>Sort by &gt; Size</strong> so you can deal with the low-hanging fruit first. Choose<strong>Delete</strong> from the options menu, then check all the games you want to erase. Once you confirm, your system will take a moment to delete the selected data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PS4-Delete-Applications.jpg"                      alt="PS4 Delete Applications"                ></p><p> Deleting a PS4 game’s data will not delete your saved data for that title, as that information is saved separately. However, if you want to play the game again, you’ll need to reinstall it from the PlayStation Store, or the disc. Either way, you’ll also be required to re-download the latest updates to play online. If you have a slow internet connection, think carefully about which games you delete.</p><p> Once you’re done, back out to the main<strong>Storage</strong> menu to see how much space you’ve gained. Feel free to delete the other types of data as well, like old videos from your<strong>Capture Gallery</strong> —though they probably aren’t large enough to make a big difference.</p><p> Ideally, you should keep a minimum of 50GB free. Though to keep your PS4 running well, it’s better to have something like 100GB free if you can manage it.</p><p> Take a look at<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-use-external-storage-ps4/" >how to add an external drive to your PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you need a lot more space. With this, you can move some games to the secondary storage location and keep enough space free on your system disk for it to run smoothly.</p><h2 id="2-Physically-Clean-Your-PlayStation-4"><a href="#2-Physically-Clean-Your-PlayStation-4" class="headerlink" title="2. Physically Clean Your PlayStation 4"></a>2. Physically Clean Your PlayStation 4</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/07-PS4-Cleaning-with-Air.jpg"                      alt="PS4 Cleaning with Air"                ></p><p> If you’ve had your PS4 for some time, chances are that dust and other grime have built up inside. This can deteriorate performance if left unchecked—with more heat trapped in the system from the debris, the system fans have to work harder, decreasing overall efficiency.</p><p> Follow<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clean-dust-playstation-4/" >our guide to cleaning your dirty PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to remove dust from its internals. Hopefully, this will help your system work at a cooler temperature and thus run games a bit more smoothly.</p><p> While you’re thinking about this topic, be sure that you have your PS4 in a healthy position, too. Don’t keep it in an enclosed space that traps heat, and be sure you aren’t blocking the vents by putting the console right next to another surface or object.</p><h2 id="3-Rebuild-the-PS4-System-Database"><a href="#3-Rebuild-the-PS4-System-Database" class="headerlink" title="3. Rebuild the PS4 System Database"></a>3. Rebuild the PS4 System Database</h2><p> If you’re wondering why your PS4 is so slow, especially while in the menus, this option is for you. You might not know that the PS4 has a utility in its Safe Mode interface called<strong>Rebuild Database</strong> . This process isn’t as intensive as defragmenting your hard drive. Instead, it tells your system where relevant data is for your games and services, making for more efficient access.</p><p> While this probably won’t improve your game performance, it reduces the home screen delays that are common with extended use of the PS4. Doing this will also cause your PS4 to check for updates for games you haven’t played in a while (upon rebooting once the process completes).</p><p> To rebuild your PS4 system database, shut down your PS4 fully by holding the<strong>PS Button</strong> on your controller and selecting<strong>Power &gt; Turn Off PS4</strong> from the Quick Menu. Once the lights on your PS4 go out, press and hold the physical<strong>Power</strong> button on the front of your console for several seconds. After you hear a second beep, your PS4 will boot into Safe Mode.</p><p> Connect your controller to your system with a USB cable, then hit the<strong>PS Button</strong> on your controller so you can use it. Select<strong>Rebuild Database</strong> , confirm the operation, then wait for it to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Safe-Mode-Resized.jpeg"                      alt="How-To-Rebuild-Ps4-Database"                ></p><p> This usually doesn’t take too long (in my case, about 15 minutes with a 2TB drive). Once it’s done, your system will reboot. The process doesn’t delete any data, though it will make your system forget what games you’ve played most recently. Recent titles thus won’t appear on your home screen until you launch them again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094414/7443" target="_top" id="2094414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094414/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Enable-Boost-Mode-PS4-Pro"><a href="#4-Enable-Boost-Mode-PS4-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Enable Boost Mode (PS4 Pro)"></a>4. Enable Boost Mode (PS4 Pro)</h2><p> If you have a PS4 Pro, there’s a setting called Boost Mode that you should definitely enable for a smoother PS4 experience. This can increase<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-fps-meaning/" >the frame rate (also known as FPS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and graphical fidelity of games on the system, even if they weren’t specifically designed to take advantage of the PS4 Pro’s superior hardware.</p><p> For instance, it might bump a game up from 30FPS to 60FPS, speed up load times, or reduce graphical pop-in. The effect varies from title to title—not all games support it, but many will work better with it enabled.</p><p> To enable Boost Mode, head to<strong>Settings &gt; System</strong> on your home screen. Inside this menu, you should see a<strong>Boost Mode</strong> option. Simply enable this, and it’s ready to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144282/7443" target="_top" id="2144282">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144282" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144282/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Install-the-Latest-Game-Updates"><a href="#5-Install-the-Latest-Game-Updates" class="headerlink" title="5. Install the Latest Game Updates"></a>5. Install the Latest Game Updates</h2><p> If you’re experiencing poor performance with a particular PlayStation title, it’s a good idea to install any existing updates for it. Often, developers release patches that fix frame rate slowdowns, shorten loading times, and similar.</p><p> Your PS4 should do this automatically for games you play regularly; it will also check for updates upon launching any games you haven’t played in a while. But in case your system isn’t always online, you can press the<strong>Options</strong> button on your controller while highlighting a game on your home screen, then choose<strong>Check for Update</strong> to do so manually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PS4-Check-for-Updates.jpg"                      alt="PS4 Check for Updates"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you’ve had issues with a game in the past, try this to see if the developers have fixed the problem you had.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Upgrade-to-an-SSD-or-Faster-HDD"><a href="#6-Upgrade-to-an-SSD-or-Faster-HDD" class="headerlink" title="6. Upgrade to an SSD or Faster HDD"></a>6. Upgrade to an SSD or Faster HDD</h2><p> The PS4’s stock 5400RPM hard drive isn’t particularly fast, so it takes a while to load games. As a result, you might consider<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrade-ps4s-hard-drive/" >upgrading your internal PS4 drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a 7200RPM disk, hybrid drive, or even an SSD.</p><p> While this will result in some loading time benefits, it won’t make a world of difference otherwise. Games will load more quickly, but it won’t improve graphical performance or other aspects of gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/06-PS4-HDD-Pulled-Out.jpg"                      alt="PS4 HDD Pulled Out"                ></p><p> This is especially true for the original PS4 and PS4 Slim. Both of these use a SATA II connection for their hard disk, which is not capable of throughputs as high as the newer SATA III connection on the PS4 Pro. So while you’ll see some benefits of using an SSD on older PS4 models, it won’t be night and day.</p><p> SSDs are also more expensive, so in most cases, you’re better off putting the money towards a larger hard drive to hold more games. Given the PS4’s age, we’d recommend saving the money and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ps4-vs-ps5-worth-upgrading/" >upgrading to a PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which has an SSD built into the system.</p><h2 id="7-Check-Individual-Game-Settings"><a href="#7-Check-Individual-Game-Settings" class="headerlink" title="7. Check Individual Game Settings"></a>7. Check Individual Game Settings</h2><p> While most console games don’t have the extensive graphical settings that PC titles offer, some of them let you change options that can affect how a game runs (or at least how it looks).</p><p> Some titles, for example, let you change the FOV (field of view) so you can see more of the game world without turning your character’s view. You may also have options to disable VSync and other graphical tools.</p><p> While not available across every game, tweaking these options can sometimes make a game feel more comfortable for you or improve performance just a bit.</p><h2 id="8-Improve-Your-PS4-Network-Performance"><a href="#8-Improve-Your-PS4-Network-Performance" class="headerlink" title="8. Improve Your PS4 Network Performance"></a>8. Improve Your PS4 Network Performance</h2><p> We’ve mostly focused on graphical performance and PS4 speed here. But if it seems like playing online games on your PlayStation 4 isn’t working as it should, you may need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-playstation-4-wifi-issues/" >fix network issues on your PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Running through those fixes will help if you’re getting disconnected from online games or don’t experience stable gameplay online.</p><h2 id="Getting-the-Best-PS4-Performance-Possible"><a href="#Getting-the-Best-PS4-Performance-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Getting the Best PS4 Performance Possible"></a>Getting the Best PS4 Performance Possible</h2><p> Keep in mind that the PS4 launched in 2013 (the PS4 Pro launched in 2016), so it’s pretty dated by now. Over time, as games become more demanding, aging hardware will have trouble keeping up.</p><p> While there’s not much you can do to physically upgrade your PS4, keeping these tips in mind will keep your PS4 running as well as it can. Organizing your system logically can also help you get to what you’re looking for more quickly.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-master-the-algorithm-effective-tools-to-increase-youtube-views/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Master the Algorithm Effective Tools to Increase YouTube Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-engage-your-audience-in-live-discord-streams-easily/"><u>[New] How to Engage Your Audience in Live Discord Streams Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tackling-problems-with-instagrams-video-feature/"><u>2024 Approved Tackling Problems with Instagram's Video Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhanced-control-and-performance-why-opt-for-corsairs-icue-link-upgrades/"><u>Enhanced Control and Performance - Why Opt for Corsair's iCUE Link Upgrades?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/guide-to-report-abuse-on-xbox-series-xs/"><u>Guide to Report Abuse on Xbox Series X/S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/improving-your-xboxs-joystick-responsiveness/"><u>Improving Your Xbox's Joystick Responsiveness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-9-oneplus-nord-n30-se-monitoring-apps-for-parental-controls-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 9 OnePlus Nord N30 SE Monitoring Apps for Parental Controls | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/mastery-levels-of-quantum-hdr-applications-for-2024/"><u>Mastery Levels of Quantum HDR Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/navigating-ai-oversight-ceos-push-for-regulation-insights/"><u>Navigating AI Oversight: CEO's Push for Regulation Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/revive-playstation-4s-wi-fi-connection-with-these-fixes/"><u>Revive PlayStation 4'S Wi-Fi Connection with These Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/seamless-xbox-viewing-on-a-secondary-laptop-screen/"><u>Seamless Xbox Viewing on a Secondary Laptop Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/solution-steps-overcoming-high-processor-load-on-chrome-browser/"><u>Solution Steps: Overcoming High Processor Load on Chrome Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/formative-tutorials-into-thriving-treasuries/"><u>Transformative Tutorials Into Thriving Treasuries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/understanding-the-xbox-series-status-shift/"><u>Understanding the Xbox Series Status Shift</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-controller-in-games/"><u>Unlock the Full Potential of Your Controller in Games</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You will hardly find a list of Raspberry Pi projects without at least one retro gaming project in the mix.</p><p> Retro gaming distributions make it easy to get started with retro gaming on a Raspberry Pi, and two of the best options are Batocera and RetroPie. We’ll compare both retro gaming distributions and help you decide which one would be a better fit for you.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="History-and-Key-Features"><a href="#History-and-Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="History and Key Features"></a>History and Key Features</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RetroPie-Themes.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Batocera is an open-source retro-gaming distribution that started as a fork of Recalbox in 2016. It is designed as a plug-and-play system that can turn any personal computer or single-board computer into a retro gaming console. You can also install it on a USB drive or an SD card for a portable gaming experience.</p><p> Unlike Batocera, RetroPie is not an operating system. It is a collection of open–source software that is built upon the official Raspberry Pi OS. For this reason, RetroPie can only run on Raspberry Pi boards, some Odroid SBCs, and Linux PCs. It is the most popular retro gaming distribution by far and one of the oldest, dating as far back as 2012.</p><p> Both Batocera and RetroPie use EmulationStation as a graphical front end and run emulator cores in RetroArch. They have other dependencies that enable them to run your favorite retro games smoothly. Batocera is purely a retro gaming operating system and has limited functionality built-in for other purposes. RetroPie, on the other hand, allows you to exit the RetroPie front end and use your Raspberry Pi as normal.</p><h2 id="Ease-of-Installation-and-Setup"><a href="#Ease-of-Installation-and-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Installation and Setup"></a>Ease of Installation and Setup</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/install-retropie-os-from-raspberry-pi-manager.jpg"                      alt="install retropie os from raspberry pi manager"                ></p><p> Both software applications are very straightforward to install. You can install RetroPie by connecting your microSD card to a computer and running the Raspberry Pi Imager. RetroPie is included in the latter tool’s list of available images (<strong>Choose OS</strong> &gt;<strong>Emulation and Game OS</strong> &gt;<strong>RetroPie</strong>). Be sure to check out our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >how-to guide on building a retro gaming console using RetroPie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Batocera is slightly more involved but still easy to install. You can use either Raspberry Pi Imager or balenaEtcher to install the operating system onto a microSD card, a USB stick, or a hard drive which you then plug into the Raspberry Pi. Read more in our guide on how to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/boot-raspberry-pi-4-via-ssd-network/" >boot a Raspberry Pi via SSD or network <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The process is uncomplicated but does involve a few more steps than a RetroPie installation.</p><p> Both options allow you to customize your setup after installation. Batocera prioritizes plug-and-play and is built to get you started as quickly as possible, so most settings are preconfigured and there are few options to tinker with. However, RetroPie offers extensive features for customizing your setup just the way you want it to be. It can be overwhelming for new users, but there are several tutorials on getting started.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043856/7443" target="_top" id="2043856">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043856" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043856/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-and-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Performance-and-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Performance and Ease of Use"></a>Performance and Ease of Use</h2><p> Batocera and RetroPie have user interfaces that look quite different, even though they both use a custom version of EmulationStation. RetroPie provides additional front-end options such as Attract Mode, Pegasus, and Mehstation.</p><p> RetroPie’s appearance can be tweaked much more, but Batocera also allows you to change themes. There is no objectively better interface, and it’s just a matter of your personal preference.</p><p> Performance, as it turns out, is a less subjective metric. Due to the sheer amount of features packed into RetroPie, the system is clunky and tends to use up a lot of resources which can be detrimental to gaming performance. However, there are specific ways to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/retropie-tips-performance/" >boost gaming performance on RetroPie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . A Raspberry Pi 4 is recommended to get the most out of it and emulate more games systems.</p><p> On the other hand, Batocera is optimized to consume as few resources as possible, reducing the load on the Raspberry Pi. It is probably the fastest retro gaming distribution, and boots up and runs games at impressive speeds with default settings. Batocera also takes the cake for being the easiest retro gaming distribution to use. Performing updates, scraping metadata, and customization is a breeze in Batocera, compared to RetroPie.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082542/7443" target="_top" id="2082542">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082542" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082542/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Emulators-and-Controllers"><a href="#Emulators-and-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Emulators and Controllers"></a>Emulators and Controllers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nintendo-controller-retro-gaming-yellow.jpg"                      alt="A photo of a retro super nintendo game controller with music notation on either side of it."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997662/19272" target="_top" id="1997662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997662/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> When it comes to emulators, both retro gaming platforms are pretty evenly matched. About every major home and portable retro gaming console&#x2F;system will have an emulator that runs on either Batocera or RetroPie. A Raspberry Pi 4 is recommended for emulating later games systems such as PlayStation 1 and Dreamcast.</p><p> There might be a few consoles missing here and there but generally, both platforms offer the same emulator options. Batocera does come with some free ROMs pre-installed, unlike RetroPie.

Common controllers are automatically detected and preconfigured on Batocera while RetroPie requires you to set them up manually.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Community-and-Popularity"><a href="#Community-and-Popularity" class="headerlink" title="Community and Popularity"></a>Community and Popularity</h2><p> RetroPie downloads make up 3% of total operating system downloads through the Raspberry Pi Imager, according to the<a class="link"   href="http://rpi-imager-stats.raspberrypi.com/" >official stats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While Batocera has a sizable community of users and contributors, it is no match for RetroPie in terms of popularity. RetroPie is almost synonymous with retro gaming on Raspberry Pi boards. Certain Raspberry Pi kits even come with RetroPie preloaded, though we advise against buying them.</p><p> RetroPie’s popularity makes it easier to get help for issues you run into. Setup guides, tutorials, and documentation are more detailed and readily available. Also, since RetroPie runs on a more limited range of hardware, you are likely to find answers that fit your specific setup, allowing you to follow these steps without making any changes.</p><h2 id="Batocera-vs-RetroPie-Which-Option-Should-You-Go-With"><a href="#Batocera-vs-RetroPie-Which-Option-Should-You-Go-With" class="headerlink" title="Batocera vs. RetroPie: Which Option Should You Go With?"></a>Batocera vs. RetroPie: Which Option Should You Go With?</h2><p> Batocera is lightweight, easy to use and set up, and is more optimized for gaming performance than RetroPie. RetroPie, on the other hand, is way more popular, has more extra features, and offers a lot of configuration options for the people who need them.</p><p> Batocera will be a better fit for beginners who prefer plug-and-play over advanced customization features. RetroPie, in contrast, would work well for Raspberry Pi users who want to tweak their retro gaming setup or run other non-gaming projects on their single-board computers. Also, you can check out other retro gaming options besides Batocera and RetroPie, such as Lakka and Recalbox.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leveraging-instagram-hashtags-to-amplify-social-media-impact/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leveraging Instagram Hashtags to Amplify Social Media Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-discovering-movavis-advanced-video-editor-plus-plus/"><u>[New] Discovering Movavi's Advanced Video Editor Plus +</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-overcome-video-loading-failure-chrome-for-2024/"><u>[New] Overcome Video Loading Failure Chrome for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-skyrocketing-video-performance-on-vimeo/"><u>[New] Skyrocketing Video Performance on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-reset-meizu-21-without-volume-buttons-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>5 Ways to Reset Meizu 21 Without Volume Buttons | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/fixing-incompatible-files-with-steam-pc/"><u>Fixing Incompatible Files with Steam PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/remedying-the-no-write-allowed-message-in-win-os/"><u>Remedying the No Write Allowed Message in Win OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/simplifying-steam-deck-ssd-replacement-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Simplifying Steam Deck SSD Replacement: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steams-new-era-of-family-sharing-features-debuts-today/"><u>Steam's New Era of Family Sharing Features Debuts Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/top-4-sim-location-trackers-to-easily-find-your-lost-lava-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 4 SIM Location Trackers To Easily Find Your Lost Lava Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-an-unresponsive-tecno-camon-20-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide How to Fix an Unresponsive Tecno Camon 20 Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlock-the-full-power-of-your-nintendo-switch/"><u>Unlock the Full Power of Your Nintendo Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/who-wins-gpt-clashes-with-bings-ai-and-google-bard/"><u>Who Wins?

This might happen because of your Steam Friends &amp; Chat settings, corrupt cache data, or a temporary glitch, amongst other things.</p><p> Even if you’re not sure about the cause, there’s no reason you should miss out on having fun with your friends. We’ve put together a list of fixes that you should try to get rid of the network unreachable error.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Restart-Steam"><a href="#1-Restart-Steam" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Steam"></a>1. Restart Steam</h2><p> There’s a chance you’ve run into the network unreachable error due to a temporary Steam glitch. Before going through more complicated fixes, try restarting the Steam app.</p><p> Most of the time, this is enough to fix minor bugs or glitches. Once you close the app, ensure no background process is still running. Right-click on the taskbar and select<strong>Task Manager</strong> . Then, right-click<strong>Steam</strong> and select<strong>End task</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/steam-task-manager-1.jpg"                      alt="End Steam Client process from running"                ></p><p>Restart Steam and check if the issue is now fixed.</p><h2 id="2-Check-Steam-Friends-Chat-Settings"><a href="#2-Check-Steam-Friends-Chat-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Check Steam Friends &amp; Chat Settings"></a>2. Check Steam Friends &amp; Chat Settings</h2><p> If restarting Steam didn’t fix the issue, you should check your account’s Friends &amp; Chat settings. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Launch the Steam app.</li><li>Go to<strong>Steam &gt; Settings</strong> .</li><li>From the left pane, select<strong>Friends &amp; chat</strong> .</li><li>Turn on the toggle next to<strong>Sign in to friends when Steam Client starts</strong> .</li><li>Restart Steam and check if you can connect to the network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-chat-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Steam friends and chat settings"                ></p><h2 id="3-Opt-Out-of-Steam’s-Beta-Participation"><a href="#3-Opt-Out-of-Steam’s-Beta-Participation" class="headerlink" title="3. Opt Out of Steam’s Beta Participation"></a>3. Opt Out of Steam’s Beta Participation</h2><p> Signing up for the Steam Client Beta program allows you to use Steam’s latest features before they’re officially released. However, the Beta version might make the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-client-crashing-troubleshooting/" >Steam Client unstable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , leading to the error. Follow these steps to disable the Steam Beta Client:</p><ol><li>Launch the app.</li><li>Open the<strong>Steam</strong> menu and select<strong>Settings</strong> .</li><li>Click<strong>Interface</strong> in the left-hand menu.</li><li>Extend the drop-down menu next to<strong>Client Beta Participation</strong> .</li><li>Select the<strong>No beta chosen</strong> option.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/steam-beta-1.jpg"                      alt="Opt out of Steam beta"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087408/7443" target="_top" id="2087408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Edit-Steam’s-Executable"><a href="#4-Edit-Steam’s-Executable" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit Steam’s Executable"></a>4. Edit Steam’s Executable</h2><p> While this isn’t an official fix, editing the executable file could fix the “Steam friends network unreachable” error. To find Steam’s executable file, search for<strong>Steam</strong> within the Start menu search bar and select<strong>Open file location</strong> . Then, right-click<strong>Steam</strong> and head to<strong>Properties</strong> . Open the<strong>Shortcut</strong> tab and add<strong>-nofriendsui</strong> into the<strong>Target</strong> field.</p><p> Click<strong>Apply</strong> and<strong>OK</strong> to save the new settings and restart Steam.</p><h2 id="5-Delete-the-Steam-Appdata-Folder"><a href="#5-Delete-the-Steam-Appdata-Folder" class="headerlink" title="5. Delete the Steam Appdata Folder"></a>5. Delete the Steam Appdata Folder</h2><p> Similar to any software that you’ve installed, Steam stores temporary files on your computer to speed up loading times and improve the user experience. However, if the stored data gets corrupted, it will negatively impact Steam’s features and functionality.</p><p> To delete Steam’s cache, press<strong>Windows key + R</strong> to launch a Run dialog. Then, type**%appdata%** and press<strong>Enter</strong> . In the File Explorer window, locate and permanently delete the<strong>Steam</strong> folder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-deleting-the-iconcache-file-by-right-clicking-on-the-file-in-windows-file-explorer.jpg"                      alt="Deleting the IconCache File by Right-clicking on the File in Windows File Explorer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you can’t find it, you should change File Explorer settings, so you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-show-hidden-files-folders/" >view hidden files and folders on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Delete-Steam’s-Web-Data"><a href="#6-Delete-Steam’s-Web-Data" class="headerlink" title="6. Delete Steam’s Web Data"></a>6. Delete Steam’s Web Data</h2><p> If you’ve deleted Steam’s appdata folder and you’re still dealing with the same issue, you should delete Steam’s web browser data. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Head to your Steam library and launch one of your games.</li><li>While in the game, press<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> to access Steam’s Community.</li><li>Click the<strong>Settings</strong> icon on the lower part of the screen.</li><li>In the<strong>Steam Settings</strong> window, select<strong>In Game</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Delete</strong> next to<strong>Delete Web Browser Data</strong> .</li><li>Confirm the action.</li><li>Close the game, restart Steam, and check if the issue is now solved.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/delete-steam-cache-1.jpg"                      alt="Delete Steam web cache"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123731/7443" target="_top" id="2123731">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123731" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123731/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-Back-to-Playing-With-Your-Friends"><a href="#Get-Back-to-Playing-With-Your-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Get Back to Playing With Your Friends"></a>Get Back to Playing With Your Friends</h2><p> The tricky part about the ”Steam friends network unreachable” error is that Steam doesn’t tell you what’s wrong and how you can fix it. If you still can’t join your friends’ server, you can use Steam’s Remote Play Together. Using this feature, you can even try new games as you can join your friends even if you don’t own the game or have it installed.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-prioritizing-elements-what-to-consider-with-a-new-4k-camera-lens/"><u>[New] Prioritizing Elements What to Consider with a New 4K Camera Lens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-best-farming-games/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Best Farming Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/effortless-play-linking-xbox-game-pass-with-steam-and-glossi/"><u>Effortless Play: Linking Xbox Game Pass with Steam & GlosSI</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-mobile-gaming-experience-fortnite-via-streaming-service/"><u>Enhance Mobile Gaming Experience: Fortnite via Streaming Service</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhancing-gaming-experience-mastering-steams-space/"><u>Enhancing Gaming Experience: Mastering Steam's Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/foremost-joy-cons-and-pro-grips-a-comprehensive-review-of-2024/"><u>Foremost Joy-Cons and Pro Grips: A Comprehensive Review of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/forging-friends-club-making-on-the-new-xbox/"><u>Forging Friends: Club Making on the New Xbox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/google-play-passs-unmatched-value-except-for-the-issue/"><u>Google Play Pass's Unmatched Value Except for the Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/governments-counteroffensive-against-monopolistic-tech-firms/"><u>Government's Counteroffensive Against Monopolistic Tech Firms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-play-classic-xbox-games-on-your-pc-with-xemu/"><u>How to Play Classic Xbox Games on Your PC With Xemu</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro to Other Android Devices Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-vivo-x-fold-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Vivo X Fold 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-entry-to-entertainment-the-ifunny-app-experience/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Entry to Entertainment The iFunny App Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/installation-simplified-setting-up-launchers-on-steam-devices/"><u>Installation Simplified: Setting Up Launchers on Steam Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/optimal-voice-modification-software-for-video-makers-for-2024/"><u>Optimal Voice Modification Software for Video Makers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/quickly-connect-live-with-whatsapp-desktop-in-laptop-settings/"><u>Quickly Connect Live with WhatsApp Desktop in Laptop Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-power-of-chatgpt-in-processing-pdf-content-techniques-explored/"><u>Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT in Processing PDF Content – Techniques Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/unveiling-ultra-details-in-minecraft-games-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling Ultra Details in Minecraft Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/why-higher-fees-seal-my-fate-as-an-ea-free-player/"><u>Why Higher Fees Seal My Fate as an EA-Free Player</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As mentioned before, creating an Android virtual machine, using Android Studio, installing Waydroid, and purchasing Genymotion are just a few of your options.</p><p> You’ll need to consider your own Linux setup and desired emulation experience to determine which option is best. Here’s a basic overview:</p><ul><li><strong>Waydroid:</strong> This application is the best option for Linux systems using the Wayland display server. If you use a newer version of Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, or Arch, you’re probably using Wayland.</li><li><strong>Create an Android virtual machine:</strong> If you want to run an extremely simple Android system, you can use the open-source Android x86 project by installing it as a virtual machine on your PC.</li><li><strong>Use Android Studio:</strong> Android Studio is primarily geared towards developers, but you can also use it to create a personal Android Virtual Device (AVD). This isn’t the best method due to the inherent learning curve, however.</li><li><strong>Genymotion:</strong> This pay-to-use application offers a convenient way to run Android virtual devices. It’s particularly good for developers, but you may also enjoy it if you want the level of support that a premium application offers.</li></ul><p> Many guides recommend installing Anbox—but unfortunately, this application was deprecated in February 2023.

Before you can start using Waydroid, though, it’s important to check whether you’re running the requisite display server: Wayland.</p><p> You can check whether your system runs Wayland by opening the terminal and entering the following to print your session type:</p><p><code>echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE</code></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/checking-system-display-server-type-in-terminal.jpg"                      alt="checking system display server type in terminal"                ></p><p> If your system runs the Xorg display server, you’ll need to switch from Xorg to Wayland before you can install Waydroid.</p><p> On Ubuntu, you can switch to Wayland by logging out of your user account and clicking the<strong>Gear</strong> icon on the login screen. When the drop-down list of display options appears, click<strong>Ubuntu</strong> to switch out of the Ubuntu on Xorg configuration.</p><p> Next, you should update your system’s package list. This will ensure that the software packages you install are all completely up-to-date. Enter the following to update the package list:</p><p><code>sudo apt update</code></p><p> You’ll also need to follow the<a class="link"   href="https://docs.waydro.id/usage/install-on-desktops" >Waydroid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installation instructions for your specific Linux distribution. On Ubuntu, Debian, and their derivatives, you can install Waydroid by entering the following in the terminal to install prerequisites, add the Waydroid repository to your system, and install Waydroid:</p><p><code>sudo apt install curl ca-certificates -y   curl https://repo.waydro.id | sudo bash   sudo apt install waydroid -y</code></p><p> Once Waydroid is installed, you’ll need to take a few steps to initialize the program. You’ll need to start the Waydroid container and enable its GUI (Graphical User Interface). You can accomplish this by entering:</p><p><code>sudo waydroid container start   waydroid show-full-ui</code></p><p> Finally, you’re ready to install Android apps on your PC. You’ll need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/safe-android-apk-downloads/" >navigate to a reputable website like APKMirror or APKPure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the APK file for each app you want to install. Once you’ve downloaded your APKs, enter the following to install the app on your system:</p><p><code>waydroid app install appname.apk</code></p><p> Wait for the app to install. Once the installation process is complete, you can run the Android app by selecting it through the Waydroid GUI, launching it through your desktop application menu, or launching it from the terminal with:</p><p><code>waydroid app launch appname</code></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Create-an-Android-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#2-Create-an-Android-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="2. Create an Android Virtual Machine"></a>2. Create an Android Virtual Machine</h2><p> If you’re comfortable creating a virtual machine, one of the best ways to run Android apps and games on your Linux PC is to virtualize an Android x86 system. To start, you’ll need to download the Android x86 ISO image.</p><p> You’ll also need to download your virtualization software of choice—in this case, we’ll use VirtualBox. This software is suitable for Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, and derivative distributions.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="http://www.android-x86.org/" >Android x86 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux%5FDownloads" >VirtualBox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Download the appropriate package for your Linux distribution, then install it from the terminal.</p><p> On Ubuntu and Debian-based distros, right-click on the file and select<strong>Open with another application</strong> . Select<strong>Software Install</strong> from the dropdown list, and finally, click<strong>Install</strong> . Wait for VirtualBox to finish installing on your system.</p><p> Once it’s finished installing, open VirtualBox. Click on the<strong>New</strong> button to create a new virtual machine, setting the following configurations:</p><ul><li><strong>Type:</strong> Linux</li><li><strong>Version:</strong> Linux 2.6 &#x2F; 3.x &#x2F; 4.x (32-bit or 64-bit depends on which version of Android x86 you installed)</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 2GB (2048MB) minimum, more if possible</li><li><strong>HDD file type:</strong> VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> Dynamically allocated</li><li><strong>HDD:</strong> 8GB (8192MB) minimum, more if possible</li></ul><p> After you’ve created the new virtual machine, you’ll still need to configure a few more settings. Select your new virtual machine from the list of VMs and click on<strong>Settings</strong> . In<strong>System &gt; Processor</strong> , allocate two or more CPU cores.</p><p> In<strong>System &gt; Acceleration</strong> , select KVM as the paravirtualization interface. In the<strong>Display &gt; Screen</strong> tab, you’ll need to change the Graphics Controller setting to<strong>VBoxSVGA</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/configuring-graphics-settings-in-virtualbox.jpg"                      alt="configuring graphics settings in virtualbox"                ></p><p> Last but not least, you’ll need to install the Android x86 image. Navigate to the<strong>Storage</strong> tab and select<strong>Empty</strong> from the list of storage devices. Next, click on the<strong>blue disc</strong> icon to the right of the<strong>Optical Drive</strong> setting and select<strong>Choose a disk file</strong> from the dropdown menu. Select your Android x86 ISO from the Files interface that appears. Finally, close the settings menu and click<strong>Start</strong> to boot your Android VM.</p><p> As prompts appear on the new virtual machine, click<strong>Advanced Options</strong> , select<strong>Auto_Installation</strong> from the advanced options list, and then click<strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the auto installation.</p><p> Once the installation process is complete, you can configure and install apps on your new Android virtual machine.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151868/7443" target="_top" id="2151868">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151868" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151868/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Use-Android-Studio-for-Seamless-Gaming"><a href="#3-Use-Android-Studio-for-Seamless-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="3.

Run Android Apps on Linux With Genymotion</h2><p> It’s worth considering applications like Waydroid and even tried-and-true virtual machines before you purchase Genymotion. In most cases, it’s possible to accomplish anything you want on your Linux PC without purchasing proprietary applications.</p><p> If you choose to purchase Genymotion, however, you’ll be enthused with the ease of use and convenience that this application offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/comparing-the-plans-offered-by-genymotion.jpg"                      alt="comparing the plans offered by genymotion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144287/7443" target="_top" id="2144287">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144287" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144287/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> To start, you’ll need to purchase the right Genymotion plan. Genymotion offers a free plan for personal use, but any technical support requests beyond issues with installation and first run will be rejected—and you won’t be able to use features like Android 13, camera and media widget features, and quick boot.</p><p> If you’re a current student or teacher, you can use your school ID to purchase full-featured Genymotion for $49 per year.</p><p> Once you’ve downloaded the Genymotion BIN file, you can install it with QEMU or VirtualBox using<a class="link"   href="https://docs.genymotion.com/desktop/Get%5Fstarted/013%5FLinux%5Finstall/" >Genymotion’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official installation guide.</p><h2 id="Enjoy-Using-Android-Apps-and-Games-on-Your-Linux-System"><a href="#Enjoy-Using-Android-Apps-and-Games-on-Your-Linux-System" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Using Android Apps and Games on Your Linux System"></a>Enjoy Using Android Apps and Games on Your Linux System</h2><p> With the deprecation of Anbox, it’s easy to wonder if any easy methods to run Android apps on Linux systems remain.

If you’re someone who regularly plays FPS games, you may need more mouse real estate for those flick shots. Downsizing to a 60 percent or tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard is a great way to get more space.</p><p> A tenkeyless (TKL) keyboard, as the name suggests, doesn’t have the 10-digit numeric keypad on the far right. A 60 percent keyboard, on the other hand, doesn’t have dedicated function keys and arrow keys. However, these keyboards have secondary functions printed on them, which you can use after pressing the<strong>Fn</strong> key.</p><p> If you’ve only used a full-sized keyboard so far, consider switching to a TKL keyboard, as the transition should be easy.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-60-keyboards-for-gamers/" >60 percent keyboards <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> have a steep learning curve due to the missing function and arrow keys. You can also go for 65 percent or<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=75+percent+keyboard&tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032167&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/unique-features-to-look-for-in-gaming-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >75 percent keyboards on Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you really want those arrow keys without losing too much mouse real estate.</p><h2 id="2-Higher-Polling-Rates"><a href="#2-Higher-Polling-Rates" class="headerlink" title="2 Higher Polling Rates"></a>2 Higher Polling Rates</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/razer-polling-rate-setting-in-synapse.png"                      alt="Razer Polling Rate setting in Synapse"                ></p><p> For the longest time, a 1000Hz polling rate has been the industry standard for gaming keyboards and mice. But thanks to the popularity of competitive gaming with 240Hz and 360 Hz monitors, higher mouse and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-keyboard-polling-rate-and-how-much-does-it-matter/" >keyboard polling rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are becoming more of a necessity rather than a luxury.</p><p> A keyboard with a 1000Hz polling rate can report input data 1000 times in one second (or 1ms). However, a keyboard with an 8000Hz polling rate can report 8000 times in a second (0.125ms). In esports games like Valorant, Apex Legends, and Fortnite, where every millisecond matters, this can be the difference between getting a kill and getting killed.</p><p> If you mostly play story-driven games casually, a 1000Hz keyboard should be more than sufficient. But if you want the edge in competitive multiplayer games, opt for a keyboard that supports higher polling rates.</p><p> I recommend the<a class="link"   href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he" >Wooting 80HE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as it features industry-leading analog switches, which I’ll get to in a bit.

When you just want to sit back and play games on your couch, you can just unplug your keyboard and use it wirelessly. It also helps that your setup looks a bit cleaner with one less cable on your desk.</p><p> I’m not talking about Bluetooth keyboards, though, because that adds a ton of input lag. For a low-latency gaming experience, you need a keyboard that supports 2.4GHz wireless mode. Peripheral makers often have their own terms for this technology. For instance, Logitech calls it “Lightspeed” whereas Razer calls it “HyperSpeed Wireless.”</p><p> These keyboards come with a dongle that you connect to your PC to set up a wireless connection between the keyboard and the dongle.

Consider analog switches as a step up from mechanical switches; they give you much more control over the actuation point and distance. Analog keyboards can use either<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/hall-effect-vs-optical-switches/" >magnetic hall effect switches or optical switches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . They both work differently to give you the same benefits.</p><p> For instance, magnetic switches have a hall effect sensor and magnets in the switch’s stem. When you press a key, the magnets trigger the hall effect sensor to activate the switch. On the other hand, optical switches have infrared sensors. When you press a key, the switch’s stem blocks the infrared beam, which the sensor detects to register the keypress.</p><p> These keyboards make a huge difference in games where you need to register a keypress as fast as possible. Unlike traditional mechanical switches, you don’t have to press the key all the down or to the switch’s actuation point to register a keypress. You’ll have a competitive edge in games where your movement is crucial, like Valorant, Counter-Strike 2, Apex Legends, etc.</p><p> Analog keyboards typically offer a feature called Rapid Trigger, which instantly deactivates the key when you release it. Also, you don’t have to wait for the key to completely reset before you press it again to register another keypress. This lets you “spam” a key as much as you want. These keyboards also let you adjust the Rapid Trigger sensitivity to as low as 0.1mm.</p><h2 id="5-The-Actuation-Point-and-Actuation-Force-of-Switches"><a href="#5-The-Actuation-Point-and-Actuation-Force-of-Switches" class="headerlink" title="5 The Actuation Point and Actuation Force of Switches"></a>5 The Actuation Point and Actuation Force of Switches</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/cherry-mx-switch-tester-up-close-with-other-switches.jpg"                      alt="cherry mx switch tester up close with other switches"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352555/5172" target="_top" id="352555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352555/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Gavin Phillips&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Another important point to consider is the actuation point and actuation force of the switches. A lower actuation point (or distance) means you’ll register the keypress faster. A lower actuation force, on the other hand, means you can press it with less effort. However, this also means you’re more prone to making typos.</p><p> If you’re considering an analog keyboard, you don’t have to worry about the actuation point, as almost all of them let you lower it to 0.1 or 0.2mm. However, standard mechanical keyboards come with various switches with different actuation points.</p><p> For instance, the popular Cherry MX Red switches have a 2mm actuation distance and a 45g actuation force. In comparison, the Cherry MX Speed (Silver) switches that target gamers have a 1.2mm actuation distance with a 45g actuation force. Keyboards with Cherry MX Speed switches include the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Switches/dp/B09NCLR4M6/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032167&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/unique-features-to-look-for-in-gaming-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Corsair K70 RGB PRO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Durgod-Taurus-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07QCVYNQ9/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032167&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/unique-features-to-look-for-in-gaming-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Taurus K320 TKL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/HK-GAMING-GK61-60-Layout/dp/B0CJQ8P7PH/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032167&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/unique-features-to-look-for-in-gaming-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >GK61 60% v3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you want something a bit faster, you can go for the<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08B3MHYPC/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032167&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/unique-features-to-look-for-in-gaming-keyboard/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Razer Huntsman Mini 60% <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with linear optical switches.

It’s great if you don’t own an Xbox console or if you’re currently travelling</p><p> Xbox Cloud Gaming lets you play the latest games at their best graphics fidelity on devices that could otherwise not run them. For example, you can play games on your phone, an underpowered PC, or even a television without a console attached.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Xbox Cloud Gaming Work?"></a>How Does Xbox Cloud Gaming Work?</h2><p> It may seem odd that you can play the latest and greatest games on something as small as your phone, but the key to Xbox Cloud Gaming (and cloud gaming in general) is that your device doesn’t render any of the game’s graphics whatsoever.</p><p> When you use Xbox Cloud Gaming to play a game, Microsoft’s servers do all the heavy lifting for you. The servers load, process, and render the game for you. Then, the server sends what it rendered to your device. In turn, your device sends your input to the server so you can control what you see.</p><p> If you have a bad connection, the visuals may look choppy and your input may lag behind. However, if your internet is good, the game will look and feel almost as if you were playing it natively at home.</p><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Get-Started-With-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Get-Started-With-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Get Started With Xbox Cloud Gaming"></a>What You Need to Get Started With Xbox Cloud Gaming</h2><p> First up, in order to enjoy Xbox Cloud Gaming, you need to be subscribed to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier.

The question is, is the service worth subscribing to? I gave the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate service a spin and noted my discoveries as I played.</p><h3 id="The-Good-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Gives-a-Responsive-Experience-With-Decent-Visuals"><a href="#The-Good-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Gives-a-Responsive-Experience-With-Decent-Visuals" class="headerlink" title="The Good: Xbox Cloud Gaming Gives a Responsive Experience With Decent Visuals"></a>The Good: Xbox Cloud Gaming Gives a Responsive Experience With Decent Visuals</h3><p> When using a cloud gaming service, there are two areas that usually take a hit over playing a game on your PC: the visuals and the response time from your controller.</p><p> For the visuals, the cloud streaming service has to make a few cuts to ensure it can properly stream the game to your PC. Without some compression, it runs the risk of sending too much visual data and causing lag.</p><p> Fortunately, while there were visual artifacts while playing games via Xbox Cloud Gaming, they were very minimal and didn’t really detract from the game. As such, I can definitely call it a win for keeping up with good visuals without going overboard and causing lag.</p><p> I was also surprised at how responsive the controls were. You’d expect some delay, given how your button presses have to arrive at the server before they happen in-game. However, there was no noticeable delay as I played.</p><p> I’m sure if you compared a locally running game with an Xbox Cloud gaming game on a frame-by-frame basis, there would be some noticeable lag. But for general play, I didn’t feel as if I was interacting with a server hundreds of miles away from me.</p><p> I also noticed that you could hot-swap your devices and continue playing without interruption. For example, if you played a game via the PC Xbox app, you could close the stream, boot up the Android app, and continue exactly where you left off.</p><h3 id="The-Bad-Controllers-Are-a-Must-to-Play-With-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming"><a href="#The-Bad-Controllers-Are-a-Must-to-Play-With-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="The Bad: Controllers Are a Must to Play With Xbox Cloud Gaming"></a>The Bad: Controllers Are a Must to Play With Xbox Cloud Gaming</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xbox-cloud-gaming-controller.png"                      alt="The Xbox app asking for a controller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> How much are you a fan of playing all of your games with a controller? If you’re not bothered by it, you’ll get along with Xbox Cloud Gaming just fine. However, if you want to use mouse and keyboard, you’re in for a rough time.</p><p> When I tried to boot up a game to play with a mouse and keyboard, the Xbox app warned me that my lack of controller was stopping me from starting the game. There was seemingly no way to get around this prompt; if you don’t have a controller plugged in, it won’t work.</p><p> Once you plug in a compatible controller (either an Xbox controller or a supported third-party brand), Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play. If you then put down your controller and try to use your keyboard and mouse, you’ll find that it still won’t work. You’re forced to use a controller, which can be a major downside if you like using a keyboard and mouse for specific genres.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Verdict-Is-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Good"><a href="#The-Verdict-Is-Xbox-Cloud-Gaming-Good" class="headerlink" title="The Verdict: Is Xbox Cloud Gaming Good?"></a>The Verdict: Is Xbox Cloud Gaming Good?</h2><p> All in all, Xbox Cloud Gaming is an excellent addition for anyone who loves playing Xbox games.

While games typically launch with settings tailored to your hardware, issues can still occur.</p><p> You can avoid these problems by accessing the video configuration screen in your game and lowering the settings. Start by reducing each option by one step, and test the game after that. Repeat this process until you find the right balance between performance and graphics quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/video-settings-in-game.jpg"                      alt="Video Settings In Game"                ></p><h2 id="4-Your-Graphics-Card-Is-Too-Powerful-for-Your-PSU"><a href="#4-Your-Graphics-Card-Is-Too-Powerful-for-Your-PSU" class="headerlink" title="4 Your Graphics Card Is Too Powerful for Your PSU"></a>4 Your Graphics Card Is Too Powerful for Your PSU</h2><p> Game crashes on your PC may also occur due to issues with the power supply unit (PSU). This usually happens when the graphics adapter demands more power than is available. To fix this, you might need to upgrade to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-psu/" >the best PSU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> capable of providing enough power to play the game.</p><p> Before swapping out the PSU, however, you should ensure that the graphics card and PC interior are clean and free from dust. A buildup of dust can increase the temperature inside a PC and put additional load on the CPU and video card, causing the system to crash. In these cases,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-your-desktop-pc/" >cleaning your desktop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might help.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144280/7443" target="_top" id="2144280">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144280" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144280/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Running-Outdated-Drivers-OS-or-Game"><a href="#5-Running-Outdated-Drivers-OS-or-Game" class="headerlink" title="5 Running Outdated Drivers, OS, or Game"></a>5 Running Outdated Drivers, OS, or Game</h2><p> Games might crash for reasons beyond (but not unrelated to) unsuitable hardware. Video drivers, for instance, should be up-to-date, as should the game itself.</p><p> To update your video drivers, visit the manufacturer’s website and download the latest version of the driver. While you are at it, install any pending Windows updates as well. If you need help, check our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/" >guide on updating Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/update-other-drivers-menu-windows.jpg"                      alt="Update Other Drivers Menu Windows"                ></p><p> You should also look for any patches and updates for the game in question. These will be available from the publisher’s website or directly through the game launcher you might use, like Steam, Epic Games, and similar platforms.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Your-Internet-Is-Slow-or-Unstable"><a href="#6-Your-Internet-Is-Slow-or-Unstable" class="headerlink" title="6 Your Internet Is Slow or Unstable"></a>6 Your Internet Is Slow or Unstable</h2><p> Game crashes during online gaming can also result from network problems, such as delays in updating the game client from the remote server. So, make sure that your network speed is suitable for the game and adjust your<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/gaming-router-tips-optimal-performance/" >router settings for an optimal gaming experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> A VPN connection could be another factor contributing to game crashes. This can happen if the VPN server experiences downtime or if the VPN client fails to maintain a stable connection. Furthermore, playing on game servers located far away can exacerbate latency issues when using a VPN.</p><p> Consider upgrading to a more reliable VPN service or refraining from using one altogether to avoid network-related game crashes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Digital-Rights-Management-DRM-Issues-May-Be-Crashing-Games"><a href="#7-Digital-Rights-Management-DRM-Issues-May-Be-Crashing-Games" class="headerlink" title="7 Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues May Be Crashing Games"></a>7 Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues May Be Crashing Games</h2><p> In some cases, DRM can put some extra strain on system resources during verification processes. Usually, it’s the DRM client or the status of the remote server that causes your game to crash.</p><p> If the game offers an offline play option, you should take it. This will prevent the DRM from checking with the remote server for suspicious activity in the game or account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-You-Haven’t-Enabled-Game-Mode"><a href="#8-You-Haven’t-Enabled-Game-Mode" class="headerlink" title="8 You Haven’t Enabled Game Mode"></a>8 You Haven’t Enabled Game Mode</h2><p> If you are using a Windows computer, it’s worth enabling Game Mode.

These programs usually actively scan for suspicious files in the background. Occasionally, your game might crash when an innocent file is mistakenly identified as dangerous and quarantined.</p><p> To avoid this, you can lower the level of file scanning (or disable it entirely) while gaming or switch to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/antivirus-for-pc-gamers/" >security software that includes game boosters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or similar add-ons.

You might need voice chat software like Discord; beyond that, your PC resources should be focused on running the game.</p><p> Shutting down other apps when gaming applies to your browser, too. You might get away with a single browser tab—anything more, however, isn’t worth risking.</p><p> That’s pretty much everything you need to ensure your games don’t crash. Applying the above-listed tips should stop your games from crashing abruptly.
