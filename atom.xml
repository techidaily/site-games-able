    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="4-Reasons-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Buy-a-PS5"><a href="#4-Reasons-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Buy-a-PS5" class="headerlink" title="4 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Buy a PS5"></a>4 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Buy a PS5</h2><p> If you subscribe to the idea of console wars, you’ll know that Sony’s PlayStation 4 was a huge success compared to Microsoft’s Xbox One—it sold more than twice as much. In fact, the PS4 is one of the best-selling consoles of all time.</p><p> However, the PlayStation 5 has a long way to go to reach those dizzy heights. Here are all the reasons why we don’t think you should buy a PS5, at least for now.</p><h2 id="1-Limited-Number-of-Exclusive-First-Party-Games"><a href="#1-Limited-Number-of-Exclusive-First-Party-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Limited Number of Exclusive First-Party Games"></a>1. Limited Number of Exclusive First-Party Games</h2><p> It’s not uncommon for gamers to play across multiple platforms, like the Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X&#x2F;S. That’s why it’s so important that a console has amazing exclusive games; those that you can only experience on that system.</p><p> The problem is that the PS5 only has a handful. While games like Astro’s Playroom and Demon’s Souls are great, it’s not enough to plunge hundreds of dollars into a console.</p><p> In May 2023, Sony hosted a PlayStation Showcase, with the expectation that viewers would be blown away by first-party announcements. Unfortunately, it didn’t amount to much, with more of a focus on third-party games—many of which looked exciting but, as Microsoft were quick to point out on <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1661489113814679553" >Twitter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , would also be available on other platforms.</p><p> Over time, this will change. Sony will eventually provide the wealth of first-party exclusive games that the PS5 sorely needs. However, at the time of writing, it’s been almost three years since the PS5 launched and it’s hard to point at a single game that’s a system seller.</p><h2 id="2-Most-Games-Are-Available-on-the-PS4-and-PC"><a href="#2-Most-Games-Are-Available-on-the-PS4-and-PC" class="headerlink" title="2. Most Games Are Available on the PS4 and PC"></a>2. Most Games Are Available on the PS4 and PC</h2><p> Compounding the issue is that many of these “exclusives” use that term loosely because they are also available on the PS4, like God of War Ragnarök and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. These games are fantastic on the PS5, but they’re great on the PS4 too. For this reason,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-it-still-worth-buying-ps4/" >it may still be worth buying the PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you don’t own one.</p><p> Sony has also committed to the PC market, bringing its console-exclusive titles like Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to the PC after a year or two, which is brilliant if you’re a patient gamer who owns a powerful gaming desktop. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-controller-on-pc/" >connect a PS5 DualSense controller to your PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Not to bemoan Sony for this too heavily, though. It’s great that the company is supporting the PC and that it hasn’t immediately cut PS4 owners off in a bid to force them to upgrade to the PS5. It just means if you already own a PS4 or gaming PC, then there’s not much incentive to buy the PS5—unless factors such as the console’s graphical prowess or peripherals like PlayStation VR2 are draws for you.</p><h2 id="3-The-PS5-Is-Too-Expensive"><a href="#3-The-PS5-Is-Too-Expensive" class="headerlink" title="3. The PS5 Is Too Expensive"></a>3. The PS5 Is Too Expensive</h2><p> In August 2022,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-ps5-getting-more-expensive/" >Sony announced that the PS5 was increasing in price <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in many regions due to the challenges of the “global economic environment”. In the US, a PS5 costs $500, which is very costly—though you can shave $100 off that if you buy the Digital Edition (which has no disc drive).</p><p> This doesn’t even take into consideration the expense of peripherals, PlayStation Plus (required for online play and price hiked in September 2023), expanded storage (you’ll quickly exhaust the PS5’s 667GB available space), or the growing cost of games.</p><p> To compare, the Xbox Series X also costs $500. However, the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch both cost $300. That’s $200 cheaper than the retail price of a PS5. Even the Steam Deck, essentially a portable and dockable PC, begins at $399.</p><p> Granted, these cheaper devices don’t pack the same punch when it comes to performance, and they host different games. But if you’re simply in the market for a fun games machine and need to save your cash, they make for optimal alternatives.</p><h2 id="4-Wait-for-the-Inevitable-Upgraded-PS5"><a href="#4-Wait-for-the-Inevitable-Upgraded-PS5" class="headerlink" title="4. Wait for the Inevitable Upgraded PS5"></a>4. Wait for the Inevitable Upgraded PS5</h2><p> At 390mm x 104mm x 260mm in size and 4.5kg in weight,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-big-is-the-ps5/" >the PS5 is one hefty beast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If you usually keep your consoles beneath the TV in a media unit, you might find that the PS5 physically doesn’t fit. And while the console’s design is fine, it’s not exactly a centerpiece; you don’t want it dominating the room.</p><p> As such, why not just wait for the inevitable revamp? The PS4’s Slim version released three years after the main console, bringing a much-needed sleeker form factor (which is now the primary PS4 model). Then there’s the PS4 Pro, capable of 4K gaming over the main console’s 1080p.</p><p> The same thing is bound to happen with the PS5, as it has done every console cycle—rumors indicate that <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-sony-releasing-ps5-slim-2023/" >a PS5 Slim will arrive in 2023 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with a smaller form factor and detachable disc drive. Plus, it might be cheaper. Patience pays off.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-a-PS5"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-a-PS5" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy a PS5?"></a>Should You Buy a PS5?</h2><p> Ultimately, only you know the answer to whether you should buy a PS5. If none of these reasons sound like a dealbreaker to you, that’s great—go ahead and buy the PS5, and hopefully you’ll get hundreds of hours of entertainment from it.</p><p> However, many people might want to pause. Perhaps wait until there are more PS5 exclusive games, it drops in price, or for the second iteration… or for all three. At that point, it’s likely that the PS5 will be in a stronger position and become a must-own games console.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/organizing-and-managing-games-using-steams-storage-tool/"><u>Organizing and Managing Games Using Steam’s Storage Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/activate-your-ps5-faster-with-these-6-hacks/"><u>Activate Your PS5 Faster with These 6 Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/transformative-tactics-for-gaming-via-steam-modding-mastery/"><u>Transformative Tactics for Gaming via Steam Modding Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/overcoming-windows-error-30005-unable-to-create-files/"><u>Overcoming Windows Error 30005: Unable to Create Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-seamless-strategy-to-enhance-your-gaming-experience/"><u>The Seamless Strategy to Enhance Your Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-sonys-games-for-free-with-psplus/"><u>Unlocking Sony's Games for Free with PS+</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/behemoth-rising-raider-hx-reviewed/"><u>Behemoth Rising: Raider HX Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/eliminating-games-from-steam-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Eliminating Games From Steam: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-why-pc-titles-outshine-consoles/"><u>Discover Why PC Titles Outshine Consoles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-asus-rog-ally-dock-line-up-2024/"><u>Ultimate ASUS ROG Ally Dock Line-Up 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-chromebook-friendly-audacity-getting-it-up-and-running-and-out-quickly-for-2024/"><u>New Chromebook-Friendly Audacity Getting It Up and Running (And Out) Quickly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comprehensible-guide-to-evaluating-mac-audio-software/"><u>New 2024 Approved Comprehensible Guide to Evaluating Mac Audio Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-xiaomi-redmi-note-12r-pattern-lock-removal-tools-remove-android-pattern-lock-without-losing-data-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R Pattern Lock Removal Tools Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-best-spy-watches-for-your-lava-yuva-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Best Spy Watches For your Lava Yuva 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/download-kinemaster-for-macos-a-beginners-guide/"><u>Download KineMaster for macOS A Beginners Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-skyvault-budget-edition-unlimited-mass-files-save/"><u>In 2024, SkyVault Budget Edition  Unlimited Mass Files Save</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/budgeting-approach-to-making-music-videos/"><u>Budgeting Approach to Making Music Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-browsing-bygone-tales-in-the-facebook-universe-with-devices/"><u>[Updated] Browsing Bygone Tales in the Facebook Universe with Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/global-gross-earnings-of-youtube-luminaries/"><u>Global Gross Earnings of YouTube Luminaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-the-top-video-animation-tools-for-creating-stunning-animations-on-the-go-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Top Video Animation Tools for Creating Stunning Animations On-the-Go for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

While it’s an interesting concept, I don’t think it’s the way forward.</p><h2 id="Who’s-Suggesting-We-Tip-Game-Developers"><a href="#Who’s-Suggesting-We-Tip-Game-Developers" class="headerlink" title="Who’s Suggesting We Tip Game Developers?"></a>Who’s Suggesting We Tip Game Developers?</h2><p> In April 2024, Mike Ybarra—former President of Blizzard Entertainment—posted the following on X (formerly Twitter):</p><p> He implied that an in-game option might encourage players to reward the developer on completion of a game, when they’re most engaged with it.</p><p> Needless to say, this post generated a lot of discussion, reheating various <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-should-be-more-expensive-reasons-why/" >debates about the price of video games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and developer salaries.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Game-Developers-Already-Earn"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Game-Developers-Already-Earn" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Game Developers Already Earn?"></a>How Much Do Game Developers Already Earn?</h2><p> The quick and unsatisfying answer is: it depends. Game Developer roles vary enormously, from sole indie developers working on their dream projects to in-house employees at the biggest publishing houses. Like many professions, game development can be very lucrative or pitifully rewarding.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/programmer-average-salaries/" >Programming salaries differ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and game developers—<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-typical-indie-game-developer-salary/" >including those who work on indie games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> —can expect a starting salary of around $40,000 in the US, rising to $70,000 with experience. Unless you’re a superstar game dev, the most you can realistically expect to earn from a studio is around $150,000.</p><p> Game devs working on their own, meanwhile, will struggle unless they strike gold. Perhaps the best example is Eric Barone, the creator of the smash-hit farming sim Stardew Valley. Barone worked on his own for over four years, but his game’s success has repaid him significantly; the developer now has a net worth estimated at $45m.</p><h2 id="Alternatives-Are-Already-Available"><a href="#Alternatives-Are-Already-Available" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives Are Already Available"></a>Alternatives Are Already Available</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/hollow-knight-kickstarter.png"                      alt="A screenshot showing the Hollow Knight kickstarter campaign."                ></p><p> Tipping is an interesting idea, but do we really need one more payment method?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/patreon-vs-ko-fi-for-creators/" >Sites like Patreon and Ko-fi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> approach the issue of funding in different ways. The former focuses on subscription and recurring payments to provide creators with a side income; regular tips, if you like. Ko-fi, meanwhile, encourages small, one-off or regular payments, more akin to the nature of tipping, but less directly associated with service.</p><p> Crowdfunding is also a popular revenue source, at the opposite end of a game’s lifecycle. Hollow Knight raised around $40,000 from just over 2,000 backers via Kickstarter. Given the game’s success, this seems like quite a small amount, but a fundraising campaign can prove an idea is good and provide just enough capital to get started.</p><p> Buying a second copy—or “double-dipping”—is another tactic fans can use to reward game creators. This is more common in the indie scene, where physical collector’s editions are abundant, and make a tangible companion to the digital copy of a game.</p><h2 id="The-Negative-Effects-of-Tipping-Culture"><a href="#The-Negative-Effects-of-Tipping-Culture" class="headerlink" title="The Negative Effects of Tipping Culture"></a>The Negative Effects of Tipping Culture</h2><p> My big fear for developers is that a tipping culture in gaming might duplicate the same problems that others in the service industry face: low pay, poor conditions, and a lack of respect. Game development suffered huge job losses in 2023, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-the-rising-costs-of-games-affect-the-industry/" >the rising cost of game production <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has led to crunch conditions in many studios.</p><p> On the counter side, consumers run a risk from ever-encroaching payment models. Microtransactions have already been broadly accepted as one cost of modern gaming, they just go into the pockets of publishers rather than developers.</p><p> Encouraging a focus on tipping may just be papering over cracks in the model, and could serve to distract from the issue of a sustainable gaming economy that’s future-proofed against <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/types-of-jobs-risk-ai/" >AI and other threats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="When-Tips-Might-Work"><a href="#When-Tips-Might-Work" class="headerlink" title="When Tips Might Work"></a>When Tips Might Work</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/super-cable-boy-itch.png"                      alt="A screenshot of Super Cable Boy’s page on itch.io showing a minimum price with an option to pay extra."                ></p><p> Seeking some positivity, I reached out to two indie game developers for their take on the story.</p><p> Game developer <a class="link"   href="https://www.grimtalin.com/p/home.html" >GrimTalin <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (The Adventures of Elena Temple) picked up on Ybarra’s point about convenience:</p><blockquote><p>“I wouldn’t mind a tip as an indie dev, who would? But I think there are plenty of ways for fans to be supportive, even without a tip option right there when you finish the game.</p><p>What I’d appreciate most would be for you to gift my game to a friend. This way we all win: I get another sale, your friend gets a freebie, and you’re a cool person to both of us.”</p></blockquote><p> Meanwhile, Sørb of <a class="link"   href="https://soerbgames.itch.io/" >SoerbGames <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Super Cable Boy) said:</p><blockquote><p>“I’m not against tipping, but my experience with voluntary payments is that devs usually end up getting paid less.</p><p>I’m a big friend of clear transactions: you pay for something, you get something. Ideally, it is as clear as possible beforehand what it is that’s being paid for and there are no hidden costs, microtransactions, gambling tricks or dark patterns.</p><p>But I generally don’t see anything morally wrong if it leads to a happy customer, as long as indie devs are fairly compensated.”</p></blockquote><p> Super Cable Boy is available on <a class="link"   href="https://itch.io/" >itch.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a digital store that lets you leave a tip when buying a game. It follows a “pay what you want” model also used by Humble Bundle.</p><p> So, while there is skepticism, some developers are clearly open to the idea if it results in much-needed extra income.</p><p> I think this is a reasonable compromise. I don’t want to see developers taken advantage of by a tipping culture that treats them as disposable. But if tipping is simply one form of recompense among many, and developers are fairly rewarded for their toil and innovation, then maybe it’s not all so bad.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/barely-safe-the-risky-overclock-saga/"><u>Barely Safe: The Risky Overclock Saga</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/high-end-graphics-on-a-minimalist-budget/"><u>High End Graphics on a Minimalist Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/are-gpu-prices-set-to-rise/"><u>Are GPU Prices Set to Rise ?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ryzen-rivalry-which-cpu-leads-in-gaming/"><u>Ryzen Rivalry: Which CPU Leads in Gaming?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/why-you-may-be-seen-as-idle-on-discord-what-does-it-mean/"><u>Why You May Be Seen As Idle on Discord - What Does It Mean?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/reducing-risks-dont-tap-into-ps5s-microphone/"><u>Reducing Risks: Don't Tap Into PS5's Microphone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/new-graphics-feature-amds-fsr-3-dlss-35-on-trial/"><u>New Graphics Feature, AMD's FSR 3: DLSS 3.5 on Trial?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-your-games-with-nvidia-g-sync/"><u>Unlocking the Potential of Your Games with Nvidia G-Sync</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/replay-classics-your-journey-through-segas-dreamcatcher-on-android/"><u>Replay Classics: Your Journey Through Sega's Dreamcatcher on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/valves-latest-features-expand-steam-sharing-for-families/"><u>Valve’s Latest Features Expand Steam Sharing for Families</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-budget-friendly-hd-desktop-recording-tools-roundup/"><u>In 2024, Budget-Friendly HD Desktop Recording Tools Roundup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-blender-a-video-editor-for-all-professor/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Blender - A Video Editor for All Professor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-iphone-6-ios-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Repair iPhone 6 iOS? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-premier-list-top-12-online-havens-for-free-photo-resources/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Premier List  Top 12 Online Havens for FREE Photo Resources</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-creating-custom-tiktok-ringtone-for-mobile-devices/"><u>2024 Approved  Creating Custom TikTok Ringtone for Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/complete-guide-on-unlocking-iphone-8-with-a-broken-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Complete Guide on Unlocking iPhone 8 with a Broken Screen? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-the-contemporary-guide-to-achieving-perfect-audio-gradual-decline/"><u>New The Contemporary Guide to Achieving Perfect Audio Gradual Decline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-4k-capturing-applications/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Guide to 4K Capturing Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-inside-the-innovations-a-detailed-look-at-powerdirector-24-release/"><u>[New] Inside the Innovations  A Detailed Look at PowerDirector '24 Release</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/streamlining-windows-update-fixes-for-error-0x800736cc/"><u>Streamlining Windows Update Fixes for Error 0X800736CC</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ace-Gaming-Journey-Recorders-Guide"><a href="#Ace-Gaming-Journey-Recorders-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Ace Gaming Journey Recorders Guide"></a>Ace Gaming Journey Recorders Guide</h2><p> It’s difficult to keep track of your video game collection, especially if it’s digital and across multiple platforms. To solve this, use a video game tracker service to manage your collection so you know what you own, what you need to complete, and what you want to buy in the future.</p><p> We’ve rounded up some of the best services to keep track of your games. Think of them as the Goodreads for video games, or the Letterboxd for video games.</p><p>These are the best video game trackers.</p><h2 id="1-Grouvee"><a href="#1-Grouvee" class="headerlink" title="1. Grouvee"></a>1. Grouvee</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/grouvee-game-page.jpg"                      alt="grouvee"                ></p><p> Grouvee has a clean interface and is easy to navigate. It’s bound to have any game you want to track because it’s powered by Giant Bomb’s API (a user-editable wiki).</p><p> Each video game entry contains the average rating from Grouvee users, a quick summary of the game, release date, platforms, publisher, and other useful information.</p><p> You can assign a status to any game: played, playing, wish list, backlog. If none fit, use “other shelf” to create as many categories as you’d like to further organize your games. You can also select on which systems you played the game—since you might own it on multiple formats, as there are <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/switching-from-console-to-pc-gaming-8-big-differences-explained/" >big differences between PC and console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Going beyond simply cataloging, Grouvee lets you leave comments to share your thoughts on the game as you play it. These are highlighted prominently on game pages, which makes Grouvee a logical choice if you’re after a Goodreads for gaming. You can also track how long it took you to finish a game and what level of completion you achieved.</p><h2 id="2-GG"><a href="#2-GG" class="headerlink" title="2. GG"></a>2. GG</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/gg.jpg"                      alt="gg"                ></p><p> GG is a stylish website that focuses on the simple features you need from a video game tracker.</p><p> From the Explore page, find a specific game or look at trending and newly released games. Each game page features information like release date and genre, screenshots, and the ability to add a review.</p><p> Importantly, you can quickly set your play status for each game. These include options like playing, beaten, and abandoned. Alternatively, create your own custom list if none of these options suit.</p><p> One downside to GG is that you need a paid membership to clone existing lists or merge your own. This can make it quite cumbersome when you first create your game collection as you have to go into each game manually. You also can’t specify which platform you own the game on.</p><h2 id="3-Completionator"><a href="#3-Completionator" class="headerlink" title="3. Completionator"></a>3. Completionator</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Completionator.png"                      alt="Completionator"                ></p><p> Completionator is a fantastic choice as a simple video game tracker, but it’s also packed full of extra features if you want to take it to the next level.</p><p> It’s really easy to create your game collection because you can import your Steam library, alongside importing any lists that you have manually created.</p><p> You get lots of options to track video games, like what platform you own the games on, what condition they’re in, your current play status, and more. Cleverly, the site provides an estimated value for your collection.</p><p> Something that makes Completionator different is its social aspect. It has a forum to chat with others. More interesting, though, is the ability to complete challenges set by other people. This is like a book club, where you all agree to complete a game and discuss it after.</p><h2 id="4-HowLongToBeat"><a href="#4-HowLongToBeat" class="headerlink" title="4. HowLongToBeat"></a>4. HowLongToBeat</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HowLongToBeat.png"                      alt="HowLongToBeat"                ></p><p> As you might guess from the name, HowLongToBeat was designed as a way to find out the length of a game. That’s useful to know if you have a limited amount of time to play or want to crack through your backlog with the shortest games (which is one way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/decide-what-game-to-buy-next/" >decide what game to buy next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .)</p><p> The site also functions as a video game tracker; add games to your backlog and mark their completion state, like whether you only tackled the main story or if you went all out and did the extras too.</p><p> You can import your Steam games and HowLongToBeat will add them to your catalog, which is wonderfully convenient. If you like, sort through these to see how long you will spend playing each one.</p><p> The site is powered by community contribution, so be sure to let others know how long it takes you to complete a game once you’ve finished with it.</p><h2 id="5-Darkadia"><a href="#5-Darkadia" class="headerlink" title="5. Darkadia"></a>5. Darkadia</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Darkadia.png"                      alt="Darkadia"                ></p><p> When most of our games are digital nowadays, it’s a shame to miss out on the satisfaction of seeing everything lined up on shelves (an important factor when <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/physical-games-vs-digital-games-best-to-buy/" >comparing physical games against digital games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .) That’s where video game tracker Darkadia comes in, which brings your virtual collection to life.</p><p> Once you add a game to your shelf, you’re able to browse through all of them at a glance. Click into a game to see information about it, like its release date and developer.</p><p> Importantly, there are many ways to tag your collection. You can mark the different play states (like completed or mastered), along with the date you achieved these and how long it took.</p><p> Two excellent features include the ability to add private notes to a game (perhaps to record its digital game key), plus an export functionality so that you’re not tied into Darkadia’s platform.</p><h2 id="6-The-Backloggery"><a href="#6-The-Backloggery" class="headerlink" title="6. The Backloggery"></a>6. The Backloggery</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Backloggery.png"                      alt="Backloggery"                ></p><p> Backloggery is a simple service compared to others listed here, but it still works as a way to catalog your video games.</p><p> The biggest difference between Backloggery and the other systems is that it doesn’t provide integration with a video game database and so you don’t get to see box art, screenshots, or other nice features. Instead of adding specific game entries to your account, you’re presented with a number of blank fields.</p><p> You fill in the name, system, and region of the game alongside its completion status. Although this provides some flexibility to manage your games however you’d like, it’s more cumbersome an experience than the other sites due to the manual nature. Nevertheless, if you want a simple video game tracker, Backloggery serves its purpose.</p><h2 id="7-Backloggd"><a href="#7-Backloggd" class="headerlink" title="7. Backloggd"></a>7. Backloggd</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/backloggd.jpg"                      alt="backloggd"                ></p><p> Backloggd is a free service to track your video games from all platforms. Use it to log the games you own, are currently playing, and have played. You can also build a wishlist, since Backloggd’s catalog includes games which aren’t yet released.</p><p> Your library is easily searchable through filters and sorting mechanisms, and you can rate and review games to remind yourself of what you thought of them. Plus, there’s an active community, which lets you engage with other players and compare your libraries.</p><p> If you love data, Backloggd has you covered. It provides extensive stats about your library, like your top genres, how the library has grown over the years, your favored platforms, the ownership breakdown (digital, subscription, or physical), and so much more.</p><p> All of this comes on a video game tracker website that is well-designed, easy to navigate, and continually updated. It’s an excellent choice.</p><h2 id="Organize-Your-Collection-With-Game-Launchers"><a href="#Organize-Your-Collection-With-Game-Launchers" class="headerlink" title="Organize Your Collection With Game Launchers"></a>Organize Your Collection With Game Launchers</h2><p> The game tracking service you decide to go for will depend on your needs—whether you want to import from Steam, crave social features, and so on. Take a look at all the ones we’ve covered and see which works best for you. Then enjoy tracking your video games!</p><p> We’ve covered how to track your entire video game collection across all platforms. You might also want to consider organizing all your PC games into a single launcher for easy accessibility.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-0x887a0006-dxgierrordevicehung-error-in-windows-10-and-11/"><u>How to Fix the 0X887A0006: DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_HUNG Error in Windows 10 & 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-complain-against-an-xbox-player/"><u>A Step by Step Guide to Complain Against an Xbox Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-csgo-on-pc-10-frames-up/"><u>Enhance CS:GO on PC - 10 Frames Up</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mastering-xbox-xs-track-your-gaming-hours/"><u>Mastering Xbox X/S: Track Your Gaming Hours</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-making-iphone-a-personal-gaming-center/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Making iPhone a Personal Gaming Center</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-maintain-your-gpu-at-ideal-gameplay-temp-levels/"><u>How to Maintain Your GPU at Ideal Gameplay Temp Levels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/achieve-discord-mastery-mac-installation-tips/"><u>Achieve Discord Mastery: Mac Installation Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/silent-space-sounder-a-next-gen-app-to-remove-distractions-from-your-mobile-audio-experience/"><u>Silent Space Sounder A Next-Gen App to Remove Distractions From Your Mobile Audio Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-download-and-installation-made-easy-for-ez-grabber-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Download and Installation Made Easy for EZ Grabber Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/optimal-space-stewards-premium-service-review-for-2024/"><u>Optimal Space Stewards  Premium Service Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-m1-max-clip-your-ultimate-guidebook/"><u>[New] M1 Max Clip  Your Ultimate Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-your-whatsapp-live-location-is-not-updating-and-how-to-fix-on-your-motorola-moto-g14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Why Your WhatsApp Live Location is Not Updating and How to Fix on your Motorola Moto G14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-2023s-leading-facebook-film-extractors-top-picks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  2023'S Leading Facebook Film Extractors - Top Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-world-of-instant-twitreaction-content/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the World of Instant TwitReaction Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-mp3-cat-sound-effect/"><u>New MP3 Cat Sound Effect</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-ways-to-track-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Ways to Track Samsung Galaxy S23 FE without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Uncover-the-11-Superb-Free-Word-Puzzle-Apps-Today"><a href="#Uncover-the-11-Superb-Free-Word-Puzzle-Apps-Today" class="headerlink" title="Uncover the 11 Superb Free Word Puzzle Apps Today"></a>Uncover the 11 Superb Free Word Puzzle Apps Today</h2><p> When you are in the mood to play a new game on your smartphone, the options can be overwhelming. Both the Android and iOS app stores are packed full of fun and challenging games.</p><p> This is especially true when it comes to word games. So, if you’re looking for something enjoyable to play when you’re bored, here are the best free word games to play on your phone.</p><h2 id="1-Wordscapes"><a href="#1-Wordscapes" class="headerlink" title="1. Wordscapes"></a>1. Wordscapes</h2><p> Wordscapes is one of a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/puzzle-apps-sites-crossword/" >great puzzle apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , combining creating words with a crossword puzzle. You just swipe to connect the letters to create words that fit into the crossword. Keep in mind that not all possible words are correct. They must fit into the crossword puzzle for you to progress.</p><p> If you enjoy relaxing word games, then Wordscapes is definitely one to check out. The puzzle packs are themed with beautiful imagery from sunrises to forests to oceans. The game also has a pleasant soundtrack to enhance your experience. For a casual and challenging word game, Wordscapes is fantastic.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Wordscapes for <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34533/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peoplefun.wordcross" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/wordscapes/id1207472156" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="2-Words-Crush-Hidden-Words"><a href="#2-Words-Crush-Hidden-Words" class="headerlink" title="2. Words Crush: Hidden Words"></a>2. Words Crush: Hidden Words</h2><p> Another letter-connecting word game with a balanced challenge is Words Crush: Hidden Words. You are presented with letters to connect that create words for the theme. But, the trick is that when you swipe through them, the remaining letters fall. So, be careful to connect them correctly when you have more than one of the same letter.</p><p> Try not to make mistakes, and earn stars so that you can unlock additional themes. You can head to the beach, kitchen, farm, and even outer space when you do well. Words Crush: Hidden Words has a simple concept, but enjoyable gameplay.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Words Crush: Hidden Words for <a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU34533/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitmango.wordscrush" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/words-crush-hidden-words/id979759584" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="3-Pictoword"><a href="#3-Pictoword" class="headerlink" title="3. Pictoword"></a>3. Pictoword</h2><p> Maybe when you play a word game, you like to mix pictures with it. If so, take a look at Pictoword. This out-of-the-ordinary word challenge tests your solving skills. You will see two pictures that combine to create a word. For example, one picture might be a key and the other a chalkboard.

You can find several OLED monitors today for under $1,000.</li></ul><p> Are you on the fence about buying an OLED monitor? Since 2022, I’ve been using an OLED monitor as the main display for my PC, and I can confidently say I can’t go back to an LCD monitor anymore. Here’s why you should go for it.</p><h2 id="1-Unmatched-Picture-Quality"><a href="#1-Unmatched-Picture-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Unmatched Picture Quality"></a>1. Unmatched Picture Quality</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/oled-and-lcd-monitor-side-by-side-on-a-desk-showing-picture-quality.jpg"                      alt="OLED and LCD monitor side by side on a desk showing picture quality"                ></p><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> The first thing you’ll immediately notice after upgrading to an OLED monitor, especially if you’re coming from a standard LCD monitor, is the picture quality.</p><p> OLED displays can shut off each pixel individually, and this makes a huge difference when it comes to black levels. The blacks you see on OLED displays during a dark scene are true blacks because the pixels shut off, and as a result, you get an infinite contrast ratio.</p><p> LCD displays, on the other hand, have a backlight that remains on even while showing pitch-black content. Take a look at the image above, for example. You can immediately tell the monitor on the left uses an LCD panel due to its backlighting.</p><p> And if that’s not enough, I want to point out that the monitor on the left has a 4K resolution, whereas the OLED monitor on the right is 1440p. I still prefer watching videos on the OLED monitor despite the lower resolution due to its superior picture quality, no matter what angle I look at it from.</p><p> Even if I look at the monitor from the side, the colors never appear washed out, and the picture quality remains consistent. If you prefer a display with a wide viewing angle, you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/buy-oled-tv-pros-and-cons/" >consider buying an OLED TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or monitor, as these displays are unmatched in that aspect.</p><h2 id="2-True-HDR-Experience"><a href="#2-True-HDR-Experience" class="headerlink" title="2. True HDR Experience"></a>2. True HDR Experience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/oled-monitor-on-a-desk-displaying-hdr-content.jpg"                      alt="OLED monitor on a desk displaying HDR content"                ></p><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Several LCD monitors in the market today advertise HDR support, but how can they truly support HDR content when most of them offer peak brightness levels around 600 nits?</p><p> OLED monitors can go up to 1,000 nits when viewing HDR content, even though their peak SDR brightness is far lower than that of LCD monitors. That’s because the pixels can shut off individually, which gives these displays a huge advantage in a 10 percent window (i.e., 10 percent of the display shows a white screen while the rest is black).</p><p> It’s worth noting that OLED monitors are indeed no match for mini-LED displays or VA monitors in terms of HDR brightness levels. The latter can exceed 1,000 nits in some cases. However, the unmatched black levels and infinite contrast ratio of OLED monitors give them the edge; they offer better visual immersion, especially in a dark room.</p><h2 id="3-Instant-Response-Time-for-Gaming"><a href="#3-Instant-Response-Time-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="3. Instant Response Time for Gaming"></a>3. Instant Response Time for Gaming</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/valorant-game-running-on-an-oled-monitor-mounted-on-a-desk-with-keyboard-and-mouse-below.jpg"                      alt="Valorant game running on an OLED monitor mounted on a desk with keyboard and mouse below"                ></p><p> Hamlin Rozario&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> If you’re a gamer, a high refresh rate OLED monitor will give you a better experience than most LCD gaming monitors. That’s because OLED displays have a near-instant pixel response time of 0.03ms. In comparison, the fastest TN LCD monitors advertise a 0.5ms response time. But what does this mean in real-world use?</p><p> In fast-motion scenes, OLED monitors will appear clearer, as they leave no trails behind moving objects. This means you don’t experience <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-monitor-ghosting-how-do-you-fix-it/" >“monitor ghosting” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — an issue that plagues almost all LCD monitors, even at higher refresh rates.</p><p> Simply put, the lower the monitor’s response time, the less ghosting you’ll experience. However, most gaming monitors have a response time between 1ms and 3ms, which is no match compared to OLED displays.</p><p> Many gaming monitors have a pixel overdrive feature to lower the response time and minimize ghosting. However, this causes another issue known as inverse ghosting, where the pixel changes colors quickly and overshoots what the target color is supposed to be, creating a ghost image on the screen. You won’t experience any of these issues on an OLED display.</p><h2 id="4-Most-OLED-Monitors-Include-Burn-In-Warranty"><a href="#4-Most-OLED-Monitors-Include-Burn-In-Warranty" class="headerlink" title="4. Most OLED Monitors Include Burn-In Warranty"></a>4.

This is mostly why people hesitate to buy an OLED TV or monitor. While it’s true that screen burn-in is unavoidable in the long term, I haven’t seen image retention on my OLED monitor despite using it daily since 2022.</p><p> Sure, if you display a static screen on an OLED monitor for hours daily over a long period, you will eventually see image retention. Fortunately, most OLED monitors in the market today offer OLED panel care features like pixel shift, pixel refresh, and panel refresh. As long as you utilize them, the chances of screen burn-in are minimal.</p><p> If you’re still concerned, we’re happy to let you know that most OLED monitors are backed by a two- or three-year warranty, which includes coverage for screen burn-in. For example, Dell and MSI back their OLED monitors with a three-year warranty, whereas Asus offers a two-year burn-in warranty.

Sure, they used to be expensive in 2022 when the technology was new in monitors, but in 2024, you can find several OLED monitors for under $1,000.</p><p> MSI’s flagship 4K&#x2F;240Hz QD-OLED monitor, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MPG-321URX-QD-OLED-Quantum/dp/B0CTSC3VS4?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032112&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/why-buy-oled-monitor/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >MSI MPG 321URX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , has an MSRP of $950. Likewise, you can find older 2023 models like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQDM/dp/B0BZRBYLP1/?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032112&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/why-buy-oled-monitor/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-%E2%80%8E27GS95QE-Ultragear-DisplayHDR-DisplayPort/dp/B0CSGWXVBN/?th=1&tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032112&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/why-buy-oled-monitor/&asc_campaign=Evergreen" >LG 27GS95QE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for under $900 on Amazon.</p><p> As you can see, you don’t have to burn a hole in your wallet while shopping for an OLED monitor. If anything, they cost a couple hundred dollars more than high-end LCD gaming monitors.

By purchasing a paid game, you can avoid the need for microtransactions and save money in the long run.</li><li>Paid mobile games generally have higher overall quality compared to free ones, with stunning graphics, good dialogue, creative storytelling, and overall polish.</li><li>Buying mobile games supports and benefits both small indie developers and larger game developer teams, allowing them to continue developing new games.</li><li>5. Paid games tend to have better long-term developer support, with consistent updates, bug fixes, and improvements, while support for free-to-play games is mostly limited to big, popular titles.</li></ul><p> There are millions of games on the App Store and Play Store, many of which are free. It’s those free-to-play games that most of us opt for—after all, why buy a game when there are lots of free options to choose from?</p><p> Consider the saying, “The best things in life are free.” This may be true in some instances, but not necessarily when it comes to mobile games.</p><p> Paid mobile games have several advantages over free ones, making for a better mobile gaming experience. Here are five reasons to buy mobile games instead of playing them for free.</p><h2 id="1-Enjoy-an-Ad-Free-Experience"><a href="#1-Enjoy-an-Ad-Free-Experience" class="headerlink" title="1. Enjoy an Ad-Free Experience"></a>1. Enjoy an Ad-Free Experience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/turned-on-iphone-displaying-pokemon-go-charizard-application.jpg"                      alt="turned on iphone displaying pokemon go charizard application"                ></p><p> Ads are annoying and intrusive, detracting from your mobile gaming experience. And if you’re playing a free-to-play mobile game, you’ll definitely encounter ads.</p><p> Of course, you can try one or two things to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-trick-disable-ads-mobile-games/" >disable mobile game ads <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . For instance, you can put your phone in airplane mode, but this isn’t without its issues. What if the game you’re playing requires an internet connection? Or what if enabling airplane mode doesn’t work?</p><p> That’s why, for the best ad-free experience, you should download a paid game instead of a free-to-play one. By the way, in case you’re wondering why we’re using free-to-play instead of free in this article, it’s because there’s a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/free-games-vs-free-to-play-games/" >difference between free and free-to-play games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Avoid-Making-In-App-Purchases"><a href="#2-Avoid-Making-In-App-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoid Making In-App Purchases"></a>2. Avoid Making In-App Purchases</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/a-man-holding-a-phone-and-a-credit-card.jpg"                      alt="A man holding a phone and a credit card"                ></p><p> In-app purchases, or IAPs, are a thorn in the side of every mobile gamer who plays free-to-play games. Often, you’ll find that you can’t progress quickly or access special in-game items without paying.</p><p> Without IAPs, you’ll spend twice as long to complete tasks and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/grinding-video-games/" >grinding through the game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to achieve goals. If you’re playing a competitive game, you’ll be at a disadvantage compared to players who do spend on in-app purchases.</p><p> Even when you’re not competing against other players, there can be restrictions like limited time to use an item, waiting for tickets to recharge, being unable to unlock certain chapters, and so much more.</p><p> To avoid all the above, you might end up either giving up on the game or making microtransactions. The problem with microtransactions is that they can add up until you end up spending much more than if you’d purchased the game.</p><p> We know free <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mobile-games-microtransactions-reasons-why/" >mobile games have microtransactions for a reason <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but they can be excessive and ruin the mobile gaming experience.</p><p> In the end, if you’re going to spend money on IAPs, why not make a one-time purchase instead and save your money in the long run?</p><h2 id="3-Paid-Mobile-Games-Are-Higher-Quality"><a href="#3-Paid-Mobile-Games-Are-Higher-Quality" class="headerlink" title="3. Paid Mobile Games Are Higher Quality"></a>3. Paid Mobile Games Are Higher Quality</h2><p> We don’t mean that free-to-play games are poor in quality. On the contrary, there are many <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mobile-games-you-can-enjoy-without-paying/" >great free-to-play mobile games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can enjoy. However, when it comes to overall quality, paid games are better.</p><p> Compare free-to-play and paid games on any app store. Free-to-play games are numerous, and you’re bound to find twice as many low-quality ones, while paid games are fewer and mostly high-quality; this is because, with paid games, developers put in a lot of effort so they can recoup what they spent during development.</p><p> If a developer were to make a low-quality game, no one would want to pay for it, which would mean a substantial financial loss.</p><p> So, if you’re looking for games with stunning graphics, good dialogue, creative storytelling, and all-around polish, check the paid games section of the App Store or Play Store.</p><h2 id="4-Support-Mobile-Game-Developers"><a href="#4-Support-Mobile-Game-Developers" class="headerlink" title="4. Support Mobile Game Developers"></a>4. Support Mobile Game Developers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/people-sitting-at-a-table-with-computers-on-it.jpg"                      alt="People sitting at a table with computers on it"                ></p><p> One of the best ways to give back to any industry is by supporting it financially, which also applies to the mobile gaming industry. Buying mobile games is one way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/support-game-developers-without-microtransactions/" >support mobile game developers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , particularly smaller indie ones.</p><p> Small developer teams and solo developers don’t have as much exposure or resources as larger ones, so they tend to struggle with making a profit. When you buy their games, you’re enabling them to continue to develop new ones. As an extra step, you can buy directly from their website, so all the revenue goes to them.</p><p> Even large game developer teams benefit from people purchasing their games. After all, if no one’s doing so, that’s a large chunk of revenue down the drain. If you can afford it, purchase paid mobile games to support mobile game developers, big and small.</p><h2 id="5-Paid-Games-Have-Better-Long-Term-Developer-Support"><a href="#5-Paid-Games-Have-Better-Long-Term-Developer-Support" class="headerlink" title="5.

While free-to-play games enjoy developer support, they are mostly limited to big, popular titles.</p><p> With paid games, developers will likely offer phone, email, or chat support. Paid games also receive more support from developers through consistent updates, bug fixes, and other improvements.</p><h2 id="Purchase-Mobile-Games-Instead-of-Playing-for-Free"><a href="#Purchase-Mobile-Games-Instead-of-Playing-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Purchase Mobile Games Instead of Playing for Free"></a>Purchase Mobile Games Instead of Playing for Free</h2><p> There are several reasons to purchase games instead of playing for free. You don’t have to deal with pesky ads, nor do you need to make microtransactions to progress or enjoy access to certain features.</p><p> Paid games are typically of higher quality and receive more support from developers. And when you buy games, you ensure that game developers can keep making new games.</p><p> If you want a perfect mobile gaming experience, buying a game is the way to go.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-excellence-with-nvidias-novel-gaming-app/"><u>Unlocking Excellence with Nvidia's Novel Gaming App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/game-pass-advantages-the-new-reality-for-xbox-gold-users/"><u>Game Pass Advantages: The New Reality for Xbox Gold Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steams-latest-update-reimagines-game-sharing-for-families/"><u>Steam's Latest Update Reimagines Game Sharing for Families</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/advanced-connectivity-hubs-for-ps5-users/"><u>Advanced Connectivity Hubs for PS5 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-power-of-steams-big-screen-design/"><u>Unlocking the Power of Steam's Big Screen Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/overclocking-my-graphics-card-was-a-bad-idea-heres-why/"><u>Overclocking My Graphics Card Was a Bad Idea: Here's Why</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/optical-vs-mechanical-switches-whats-best-for-gaming/"><u>Optical Vs.

If you play a lot of games with a controller or use Steam in a living room gaming setup, Big Picture mode could be just what you’re looking for to take your gaming rig to the next level.</p><p> If that sounds like something you would be interested in, this article will explain exactly what Steam’s Big Picture mode is and how to use it.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#What-Is-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="What Is Steam’s Big Picture Mode?"></a>What Is Steam’s Big Picture Mode?</h2><p> Big Picture mode is a Steam feature that gives the platform an all-new user interface. This UI is easy to navigate with a controller and features larger font to make it easier to read when you’re gaming on television screens. This allows you to enjoy your Steam games from the comfort of your sofa rather than perched at your desk, hunched over your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/big-picture-mode-settings.jpg"                      alt="Big Picture Mode UI"                ></p><p> Big Picture mode looks similar to the home screen interfaces of many of your favorite video game consoles. It provides you with all the functionality of the desktop app but in a new easy-to-read format.</p><h2 id="Why-Should-I-Use-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#Why-Should-I-Use-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Why Should I Use Steam’s Big Picture Mode?"></a>Why Should I Use Steam’s Big Picture Mode?</h2><p> Big Picture mode is designed specifically to help gamers <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-use-console-controllers-steam/" >set up and use console controllers to play games on Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Not everyone likes gaming with a keyboard and mouse, some would prefer to hook Steam up to their TV and relax on the couch with a controller. There are many <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-ways-to-stream-video-games-from-your-pc-to-your-main-tv/" >ways to stream PC games to your TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and Big Picture mode is the perfect way to bring everything together and make it feel like you’re playing on a home console.</p><p> But although it’s designed to help gamers use Steam with a controller instead of a mouse and keyboard, you don’t have to be gaming in your living room to use Big Picture mode. Steam’s Big Picture mode works well in any setting, and it isn’t just for TV use.</p><h2 id="How-to-Launch-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#How-to-Launch-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How to Launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode"></a>How to Launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode</h2><p> If you would like to use Steam’s Big Picture mode, first ensure that your system meets the requirements. Big Picture mode currently runs on Windows 7 or newer, MacOS 10.11 or later, Linux machines using up-to-date Ubuntu versions, and SteamOS.</p><p> If your device meets the above requirements, you are ready to continue. Here are some basic instructions on how to launch Big Picture mode.</p><h3 id="How-to-Enter-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#How-to-Enter-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How to Enter Big Picture Mode"></a>How to Enter Big Picture Mode</h3><p> There are a few different ways to launch Big Picture mode on Steam. The first and easiest method is by pressing the home button on your controller. Alternatively, you can press the<strong>Big Picture mode icon</strong> in the top-right corner of the screen. It looks like a small display monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/how-to-enter-big-picture-mode-on-steam-second-option.jpg"                      alt="How to Enter Big Picture Mode on Steam Second Option"                ></p><p> You can also enter Big Picture mode by selecting<strong>View</strong> from the menu in the top left corner and pressing<strong>Big Picture Mode</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/how-to-enter-big-picture-mode-on-steam.jpg"                      alt="How to Enter Big Picture Mode on Steam"                ></p><p> If you primarily use Steam with a controller, you can also set up Steam to boot up in big Picture mode every time you open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/start-steam-in-big-picture-mode-setting.jpg"                      alt="Start Steam in Big Picture Mode Setting"                ></p><p> To do that, head to your<strong>Settings</strong> , select<strong>Interface</strong> , and press<strong>Start Steam in Big Picture Mode</strong> .</p><h3 id="How-to-Exit-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#How-to-Exit-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="How to Exit Big Picture Mode"></a>How to Exit Big Picture Mode</h3><p> To exit Big Picture mode, head to the<strong>Menu</strong> , press<strong>Power</strong> , and then select<strong>Exit Big Picture</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/how-to-exit-big-picture-mode-steam.jpg"                      alt="How to Exit Big Picture Mode Steam"                ></p><p> If your keyboard is nearby, you can also press the<strong>Alt</strong> and<strong>Enter</strong> keys at the same time.</p><h2 id="Controller-Support-Levels"><a href="#Controller-Support-Levels" class="headerlink" title="Controller Support Levels"></a>Controller Support Levels</h2><p> Although you can open any Steam game in Big Picture mode, not every game has full controller support. Steam uses controller icons to show controller compatibility.</p><p> If you see a partially-filled controller icon next to a game’s title, that game offers partial controller support. The use of a mouse and keyboard may be necessary while downloading, launching, or playing the game.</p><p> If you see a filled-in controller icon next to a game’s title, that game offers full controller support. You should be able to download, launch, and play this game with only a controller.</p><h2 id="You-Can-Now-Use-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode"><a href="#You-Can-Now-Use-Steam’s-Big-Picture-Mode" class="headerlink" title="You Can Now Use Steam’s Big Picture Mode"></a>You Can Now Use Steam’s Big Picture Mode</h2><p> This has been a basic guide on how to use Steam’s Big Picture mode. If you use a controller while gaming on a PC or television, you can now enter Big Picture mode whenever you wish. It is as easy as holding the home button down on your controller.</p><p> Now you can get comfy and enjoy Steam from the warm embrace of your sofa rather than straining your back by hovering over your desk with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/this-app-lets-you-play-nintendo-classics-on-your-iphone-heres-how/"><u>This App Lets You Play Nintendo Classics on Your iPhone: Here's How</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ai-ally-in-gaming-top-6-approaches-with-chatgpt/"><u>AI Ally in Gaming: Top 6 Approaches with ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/secure-your-playthroughs-backup-and-repeat-screenshots/"><u>Secure Your Playthroughs: Backup and Repeat Screenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-performance-gaming-from-logitech-mice/"><u>Ultimate Performance Gaming From Logitech Mice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/crank-up-the-challenge-with-frustrating-fiddlers/"><u>Crank Up the Challenge with Frustrating Fiddlers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/next-level-gaming-10-must-try-games-on-google-play-pc/"><u>Next-Level Gaming: 10 Must-Try Games on Google Play PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-steam-decks-cloud-connectivity-problems/"><u>Resolving Steam Deck's Cloud Connectivity Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/top-10-facts-on-m1-max-clips/"><u>Top 10 Facts on M1 Max Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/top-10-airplay-apps-in-meizu-21-pro-for-streaming-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Meizu 21 Pro for Streaming | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-logic-pros-approach-to-softening-audio-tracks-gradually/"><u>2024 Approved  Logic Pro's Approach to Softening Audio Tracks Gradually</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/wav-converter-101-everything-you-need-to-know/"><u>Wav Converter 101 Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-approach-to-perfect-slow-mo-videos-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step-By-Step Approach to Perfect Slow Mo Videos on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uncomplicated-pc-record-functionality/"><u>2024 Approved  Uncomplicated PC Record Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/top-10-photo-editing-software-options-beyond-windows-10-photos-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 Photo Editing Software Options Beyond Windows 10 Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-10-top-rated-digital-video-cutting-tools/"><u>[New] In 2024, 10 Top-Rated Digital Video Cutting Tools</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Brilliant-Blend-of-Tradition-and-Innovation-Why-Pi"><a href="#A-Brilliant-Blend-of-Tradition-and-Innovation-Why-Pi" class="headerlink" title="A Brilliant Blend of Tradition and Innovation: Why Pi?"></a>A Brilliant Blend of Tradition and Innovation: Why Pi?</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>The Raspberry Pi 5 offers a significant upgrade in processing power with a new quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor, leading to faster speeds and improved power efficiency.</li><li>The GPU in the Raspberry Pi 5 is a Broadcom VideoCore VII, providing several times the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4 and supporting OpenGL ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.2.</li><li>Despite its improved performance, the Raspberry Pi 5 remains power-efficient, thanks to a power-saving processor, LPDDR4X RAM, and an advanced PMIC, resulting in efficient performance for various tasks, including retro gaming.</li></ul><p> The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been the top dog in the Raspberry Pi line-up for quite some time, but now that title belongs to the upcoming Raspberry Pi 5. This little single-board computer boasts some impressive specs and may just offer the very upgrade your retro gaming project needs.</p><p> Here are some of the reasons to use a Raspberry Pi 5 for your retro gaming project, instead of previous models and other alternatives.</p><h2 id="1-The-Processor-Is-More-Powerful"><a href="#1-The-Processor-Is-More-Powerful" class="headerlink" title="1. The Processor Is More Powerful"></a>1. The Processor Is More Powerful</h2><p> Although the Raspberry Pi 5 improves on its predecessor in a number of ways, the processor is the most noticeable upgrade. The Raspberry Pi 5 sports a new application processor, the BCM2712, derived from the 28-nanometer BCM2711 (Raspberry Pi 4) with certain enhancements.</p><p> This chip features a quad-core, 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor, clocked at 2.4GHz, up from the 1.8GHz base clock speed offered by the Raspberry Pi 4. The Cortex-A76 is a noteworthy processor that was featured in the Exynos 990 system-on-chip and used in Rockchip RK3588 and RK3588s.</p><p> The Cortex-A76 is three generations ahead of the Cortex-A72 and offers more instructions per clock (IPC) at a lower energy consumption rate. This allows for faster processing speeds, better power efficiency, and improvement in machine learning capability over the Raspberry Pi 4B. According to the official <a class="link"   href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/" >Raspberry Pi 5 page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this new board offers two to three times the speed of the Raspberry Pi.</p><p> There will be two RAM options at release, 4GB and 8GB, but other variants should be available later. We might even see a 16GB RAM Raspberry Pi 5.</p><h2 id="2-The-GPU-Is-Better"><a href="#2-The-GPU-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="2. The GPU Is Better"></a>2. The GPU Is Better</h2><p> The Raspberry Pi 5 features a Broadcom VideoCore VII GPU, up from the VideoCore VI found with the Raspberry Pi 4. The VideoCore VII GPU supports OpenGL ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.2, with fully open-source Mesa drivers from Igalia.</p><p> This all-new GPU offers a significant upgrade from the Raspberry Pi 4. It offers several times the performance of the Raspberry Pi 4 in most graphics benchmarks.<a class="link"   href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/raspberry-pi-5-graphics" >Phoronix reported <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that the Raspberry Pi 5 was capable of running YQuake2 (a modded, open-source version of Quake II) at 230fps while the Raspberry Pi 4 struggled with 90fps. Also, Vulkan compute performance was much faster with the Raspberry Pi 5.</p><p> Additionally, the Raspberry Pi 5 is now capable of running two 4K displays @60Hz with HDR support using the two micro-HDMI ports supplied on the board. Playing retro games on a 4K monitor might be a bit overkill, but it is good to know that you can.</p><h2 id="3-It-Is-Still-Remarkably-Power-Efficient"><a href="#3-It-Is-Still-Remarkably-Power-Efficient" class="headerlink" title="3. It Is Still Remarkably Power-Efficient"></a>3. It Is Still Remarkably Power-Efficient</h2><p> While it offers much faster performance than the last generation, the Raspberry Pi 5 is still quite efficient. It is even more efficient than the Raspberry Pi 4 for the same processing workload due to a power-saving processor, LPDDR4X RAM, and an advanced PMIC.</p><p> We have to wait till the Raspberry Pi 5 is released before we get specific power consumption numbers. We do know that the Raspberry Pi 5 draws more power than the Raspberry Pi 4 when running at full throttle. It has a peak power consumption of 12W compared to Pi 4’s peak of 8W. This increase in power consumption won’t matter for basic productivity tasks and light browsing, but it may become significant when running heavier workloads.</p><p> The Raspberry Pi 5 uses a new power management integrated circuit (PMIC) which provides up to 20A of current to power the Cortex-A76 and other digital logic in the BCM2712 application processor. The PMIC allows the Raspberry Pi to sport a shiny new real-time clock and an actual onboard power button. This means that you can make a <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >handheld Raspberry Pi gaming console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without having to mess around with the GPIO pins. You may be surprised to know that there are several <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-on-a-raspberry-pi/" >ways to turn on a Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="4-It-Can-Run-DreamCast-GameCube-and-PSP-Games"><a href="#4-It-Can-Run-DreamCast-GameCube-and-PSP-Games" class="headerlink" title="4. It Can Run DreamCast, GameCube, and PSP Games"></a>4. It Can Run DreamCast, GameCube, and PSP Games</h2><p> Since the Raspberry Pi 5 isn’t out yet and graphics driver support is still in the early stages, it is hard to say for sure what retro gaming consoles the Pi 5 will be able to emulate. Currently, the Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm is the most optimized operating system for the Raspberry Pi 5. It is not yet available for download, but will ship with the Raspberry Pi 5.</p><p> Based on ETA Prime’s video, the Raspberry Pi 5 can run Nintendo 64 (better than the Raspberry Pi 4), Dreamcast, GameCube, and even PSP games. Performance on some of these consoles was not amazing, but even at this early stage of development it is clear to see that the Raspberry Pi 5 marks a great deal of improvement over its predecessor.</p><p> We are keeping our fingers crossed that this may be the Raspberry Pi that is finally powerful enough to emulate PS2 games.</p><h2 id="5-Cheaper-Than-Alternatives"><a href="#5-Cheaper-Than-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="5. Cheaper Than Alternatives"></a>5. Cheaper Than Alternatives</h2><p> The Raspberry Pi has not lost its edge when it comes to pricing. Although there are more <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/powerful-sbc-extra-computing-power/" >powerful single-board computer alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market, the Raspberry Pi 5 is competitively priced. It is not the cheapest SBC, but it does maintain a fair balance between price and performance.</p><p> The 4GB and 8GB variants are priced at $60 and $80 (excluding taxes), respectively. 1GB and 2GB models will be even cheaper. However, be sure to buy from authorized resellers only, to avoid paying scalper prices.</p><p> According to Eben Upton in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/" >Pi 5 launch announcement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the company will “ring-fence all of the Raspberry Pi 5s we sell until at least the end of the year for single-unit sales to individuals, so you get the first bite of the cherry.” So, that should mitigate <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/raspberry-pi-stock-levels-finally-improving/" >Raspberry Pi availability issues <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> early on.</p><h2 id="6-Better-Software-Support-Than-Most-Alternatives"><a href="#6-Better-Software-Support-Than-Most-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="6. Better Software Support Than Most Alternatives"></a>6. Better Software Support Than Most Alternatives</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/odroidn2aplusa.jpg"                      alt="ODROID N2+ SBC"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-n2-with-4gbyte-ram-2/" >Hardkernel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Raspberry Pi 5 maintains a key advantage of the platform over its competitors: software support. Most Raspberry Pi alternatives do not have mainline Linux support, instead providing a few custom images. However, these builds get outdated very quickly as development slows and the manufacturer moves on to other products.</p><p> Raspberry Pi, on the other hand, provides consistent long-term software support and drivers are usually patched upstream to maintain mainline kernel support. As a result, you will most likely be able to run your favorite retro game distribution on a Raspberry Pi. While the Raspberry Pi 5 will not be the most powerful single-board computer on the market, it will be one of the best-supported.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Raspberry-Pi-for-Retro-Gaming-Yet"><a href="#The-Best-Raspberry-Pi-for-Retro-Gaming-Yet" class="headerlink" title="The Best Raspberry Pi for Retro Gaming Yet"></a>The Best Raspberry Pi for Retro Gaming Yet</h2><p> Raspberry Pi 5 will be available for purchase in late October, shortly after the release of the official operating system for the single-board computer, Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm. Demand will be high for this board, so be sure to pre-order one as soon as possible.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unleashing-hidden-pleasures-in-playstation-5/"><u>Unleashing Hidden Pleasures in PlayStation 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/understanding-why-youre-labeled-idle-on-discord-platform/"><u>Understanding Why You're Labeled 'Idle' On Discord Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steam-hits-back-against-easy-refund-scams/"><u>Steam Hits Back Against Easy Refund Scams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/maximize-opera-capabilities-unlocking-free-discord-time/"><u>Maximize Opera Capabilities - Unlocking Free Discord Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/dropping-paywalls-5-reasons-to-keep-your-games-home/"><u>Dropping Paywalls: 5 Reasons to Keep Your Games Home</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/upgrade-gameplay-display-tvs-fullscreen-in-playnite/"><u>Upgrade Gameplay Display: TV's Fullscreen in Playnite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/can-you-adapt-retro-dock-to-work-with-oled-switch/"><u>Can You Adapt Retro Dock to Work With OLED Switch?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/grasp-total-console-playtime-using-xbox-series-xs/"><u>Grasp Total Console Playtime Using Xbox Series X/S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719173196069-bigger-frames-better-experiences-in-gaming/"><u>Bigger Frames, Better Experiences in Gaming!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elite-handheld-games-with-controller-support/"><u>Elite Handheld Games with Controller Support</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-cutting-techniques-for-sports-entertainment-films/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Cutting Techniques for Sports Entertainment Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/cut-the-clutter-convert-videos-discover-the-best-alternatives-for-flv-to-yt/"><u>Cut the Clutter, Convert Videos  Discover the Best Alternatives for Flv to YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-likes-and-shares-for-financial-gain-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leveraging Likes and Shares for Financial Gain on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/top-picks-for-professional-video-opening-tools-for-2024/"><u>Top Picks for Professional Video Opening Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-effortless-transfer-facebook-videos-from-pcmac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Effortless Transfer  Facebook Videos From PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-time-saving-techniques-capturing-your-google-voice-conversations/"><u>[New] Time-Saving Techniques  Capturing Your Google Voice Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-best-tools-to-hard-reset-realme-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Best Tools to Hard Reset Realme 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-innovation-showcase-leading-4k-recorders-of-the-year/"><u>[New] In 2024, Innovation Showcase  Leading 4K Recorders of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-guide-to-capturing-lol-showdowns-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Guide to Capturing LOL Showdowns for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-ubuntu-video-editors-top-picks-for-creators/"><u>New In 2024, Free Ubuntu Video Editors Top Picks for Creators</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

To do so, head back to the Prime Gaming website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/link-twitch-account-to-prime-gaming.jpg"                      alt="Link Twitch Account to Prime Gaming"                ></p><p> Select your<strong>account name</strong> in the top right corner of the screen and select<strong>Link Twitch account</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/link-accounts-to-link-twitch-account-to-prime-gaming.jpg"                      alt="Link Accounts to Link Twitch Account to Prime Gaming"                ></p><p> This will open a popup, so select<strong>Link accounts</strong> to get started.

How to Use Your Free Twitch Sub With Amazon Prime"></a>3. How to Use Your Free Twitch Sub With Amazon Prime</h2><p> There are a few hoops to jump through to gain access to your monthly Twitch Subscription with Prime Gaming, but now that you’ve completed the above steps, you’re ready to claim it.</p><p> To finally use your free sub, head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.twitch.tv/" >Twitch website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and open your favorite streamer’s channel.</p><p> At the bottom right of the stream window, you will see a box labeled<strong>Subscribe</strong> . Select that to bring up the subscription window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/subscribe-button-location-on-twitch.jpg"                      alt="Subscribe Button Location on Twitch"                ></p><p> A regular subscription to a Twitch channel costs $4.99&#x2F;month, which you will see in the bottom right of the subscription window.</p><p> If you have a free Prime Gaming sub, however, a checkbox labeled<strong>Use Prime Sub</strong> will be present. Check that box to redeem your free monthly Twitch subscription and select<strong>Subscribe with Prime</strong> to confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/use-prime-sub-button-on-twitch.jpg"                      alt="Use Prime Sub Button on Twitch"                ></p><p> The checkbox will only be available if Twitch subscriptions are allowed in your country, you have already activated Prime Gaming, the channel you are trying to subscribe to is a Twitch Affiliate or Partner, and you haven’t used your free subscription for the month.</p><p> If any of these conditions aren’t met, the option won’t be available to you.</p><p> Once you have successfully used your Prime Gaming sub, you can view and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/manage-twitch-subscriptions/" >manage your Twitch subscriptions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the website.</p><p> Free things are always hard to pass up, and since subscriptions are what keep Twitch, and its streamers going, your one free sub every month with Prime is easily one of the most <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/twitch-features-every-user-should-know/" >important Twitch features that every user should know about <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> An Amazon Prime subscription not only provides you with many shows and movies to watch but also gives you the chance to support your favorite creators for free.</p><p> Subscriptions build up, and you no doubt have a growing list of monthly payments to subscription services already. But at least with Amazon Prime, you can scratch one Twitch subscription fee off your list each month.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/digital-battles-selecting-the-best-game-device/"><u>Digital Battles: Selecting the Best Game Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-magic-behind-nvidias-g-sync-technology/"><u>Unveiling the Magic Behind Nvidia's G-Sync Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/digital-goods-get-em-for-xbox/"><u>Digital Goods: Get 'Em for Xbox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/harmonizing-playstation-5-memberships-for-efficiency/"><u>Harmonizing PlayStation 5 Memberships for Efficiency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-tier-gaming-setup-with-modular-keyboard-akkos-mod007b/"><u>Top-Tier Gaming Setup with Modular Keyboard - Akko's MOD007B</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-steam-data-coordination-errors/"><u>Resolving Steam Data Coordination Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-mechanics-behind-nvidia-g-sync-for-gamers/"><u>Unraveling the Mechanics Behind Nvidia G-Sync for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/chatgpt-scripting-mastery-for-gaming-worlds/"><u>ChatGPT Scripting Mastery for Gaming Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-reducing-camera-movement-pro-tips-for-smoother-videos-in-ae/"><u>New In 2024, Reducing Camera Movement Pro Tips for Smoother Videos in AE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-azure-transcription-in-your-apps/"><u>2024 Approved  Integrating Azure Transcription in Your Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/what-is-the-best-pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-on-vivo-y36-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On Vivo Y36? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-framing-moments-with-notes-composers-and-clip-assembly-in-filmography/"><u>2024 Approved Framing Moments with Notes Composers and Clip Assembly in Filmography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-screen-recorders-face-off-determining-superiority-of-bandicam-and-camtasia-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Screen Recorders Face-Off  Determining Superiority of Bandicam & Camtasia for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-premiere-pro-exposure-corrections-to-fix-overlit-iphone-videos/"><u>[Updated] Premiere Pro Exposure Corrections to Fix Overlit iPhone Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-install-and-uninstall-audacity-on-ubuntu/"><u>New In 2024, How to Install and Uninstall Audacity on Ubuntu</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/expertly-chosen-top-5-premium-drones-for-professionals/"><u>Expertly Chosen  Top 5 Premium Drones for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-instagrams-rising-stars-discover-the-magic-behind-their-growth-in-9-steps/"><u>[New] Instagram's Rising Stars  Discover the Magic Behind Their Growth in 9 Steps</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

I’ll be covering these accessories in detail later.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-base-wheel-and-clamp.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 base, wheel, and clamp"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The R5 Bundle came in the largest box, housing the ES Steering Wheel, R5 Wheel Base, SR-P Lite pedals, table clamp, power supply, cables, tools, nuts, and bolts. It was surprising how well they could pack everything into a relatively small space despite not having to assemble anything except the table clamp. You will also need to move the brake pedal closer to the center since it’s way too far to the left to fit the R5 wheel base in between.</p><p> The accessories came in smaller boxes, with only the clutch pedal themed the same as the main R5 Bundle box, while the rest arrived in plain, white cardboard boxes with black text and an image.</p><h2 id="MOZA-R5-First-Impressions"><a href="#MOZA-R5-First-Impressions" class="headerlink" title="MOZA R5 First Impressions"></a>MOZA R5 First Impressions</h2><p> Taking out the ES Steering Wheel is the first thing you’ll do when opening up the box, and it’s certainly exciting. The faux leather feels and smells good, but apart from the touch, the shiny brushed design on the face and rattly buttons didn’t resonate well with me.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-quick-release-detached.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 quick release detached"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The thing that caught my attention about the rim is the quick release. It was intimidating in a good way and instilled the sense that this isn’t a toy, but a serious piece of kit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-without-steering-wheel.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 without steering wheel"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The R5 Wheel Base is dense and heavy, more than I imagined, further exciting me and solidifying its presence as serious equipment. It has a thick and durable layer of powder-coating, which is a nice touch, preventing scratches and fingerprints. It also has some fins, which I suppose are for heat dissipation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/closeup-of-r5-quick-release.JPG"                      alt="Closeup of R5 quick release"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> However, the quick release on the wheel base feels like it’ll eventually get scratched, especially with a sticker stating that the quick release might have scratches from quality assurance testing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/sr-p-lite-pedals-with-clutch.JPG"                      alt="SR-P Lite pedals with clutch"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> The pedals are also heavy with a thick powder coating, but the edges are quite sharp, which makes them a little scary to handle. I was also disappointed to find that all the pedal faces are the same shape and size and completely flat with no adjustability. This could pose a problem, which I’ll discuss in the driving experience later.</p><h2 id="MOZA-R5-Bundle-Hardware-Setup-Experience"><a href="#MOZA-R5-Bundle-Hardware-Setup-Experience" class="headerlink" title="MOZA R5 Bundle Hardware Setup Experience"></a>MOZA R5 Bundle Hardware Setup Experience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-on-desk.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 on desk"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Setting up the R5 Bundle was pretty easy; you probably won’t even need to look at the instructions since everything just makes sense. The only things that I had to use the tools for were to attach the table clamp to the wheel base, move the brake pedal to the center, and attach the Brake Performance Kit.</p><p> I was worried that I’d have a mess of cables to deal with every time I wanted to set it up and take it down, as I am just using my desk to race on. Thankfully, there are only three cables and I was quickly able to think of a system to set it up and stow it away easily after racing, which I’ll get into detail in the desk usage section.</p><p> I was able to clamp it to my desk and get in position after just about 20 minutes since unboxing—and that’s including adding the clutch pedal and brake mod.</p><h2 id="MOZA-Pit-House-Software"><a href="#MOZA-Pit-House-Software" class="headerlink" title="MOZA Pit House Software"></a>MOZA Pit House Software</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-pit-house-software-with-configured-games-list.jpg"                      alt="MOZA Pit House software with configured games list"                ></p><p> I thought I’d have a headache trying to get everything ready on the software side for driving, but the MOZA Pit House software on PC impressed me.

I was able to easily grab a configuration file from a local sim racer for Assetto Corsa, and importing it wasn’t a complicated process.</p><p> I did face two issues that were fixed by resetting the wheel base in the Pit House software. First was the “Hands-Off Protection” safety feature, which disconnects the FFB when your hands aren’t on the wheel in case of large crashes. It wasn’t working for me until I reset the wheel base. Even then, it still sometimes flicked if the crash wasn’t big enough, but still significant enough to cause some pain.</p><p> Secondly, and more significantly, the wheel base was turning on its own. It wouldn’t do this while driving, or not that I’ve noticed anyway, but the wheel felt grainy and turned about 60-degrees clockwise on its own. It wasn’t until four weeks into playing with it did I actually attempt to reset the wheel base and it made the wheel feel incredibly smooth, and it didn’t turn on its own anymore.</p><h2 id="MOZA-Racing-Mobile-App-Experience"><a href="#MOZA-Racing-Mobile-App-Experience" class="headerlink" title="MOZA Racing Mobile App Experience"></a>MOZA Racing Mobile App Experience</h2><p> The MOZA Racing mobile app is also quite handy, but I wasn’t able to make it work the first time. I left it alone for a few days to focus on the driving experience and using Pit House, but it magically worked when I tried it again. I may have just needed to restart either the wheel base, software, or my PC.</p><p> The mobile app has all the adjustments you can make as with the Pit House software, including the advanced FFB settings, but you can’t reset the wheel base or update it from the mobile app. That’s fine since you’d have it plugged to a PC to do those things anyway. I also noticed that applying different pedals curves sometimes bugged out (as you can see in the first image in the gallery below).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/pedal-curve-settings-bugging-out.jpg"                      alt="Pedal curve settings bugging out"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/pedal-curve-settings.jpg"                      alt="Pedal curve settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-racing-moible-app-connected-hardware.jpg"                      alt="MOZA Racing moible app connected hardware"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/ffb-frequency-settings.jpg"                      alt="FFB frequency settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/wheel-base-settings-advanced.jpg"                      alt="Wheel base settings advanced"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-racing-mobile-app-wheel-base-settings.jpg"                      alt="MOZA Racing Mobile App Wheel Base settings"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> The app could use some language improvements though, as the wording can be quite strange, such as “Enter the car” to change the settings, “SteeringWheel Recenter,” and “Unconnected to the screen”.</p><h2 id="Desk-Usage"><a href="#Desk-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Desk Usage"></a>Desk Usage</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-beside-headphones.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 beside headphones"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The MOZA R5 is mounted on my desk since I don’t have a dedicated sim rig yet, but as mentioned, I was able to figure out a system for setting it up and stowing it away quickly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/sticky-pads-for-sr-p-lite-pedals.jpg"                      alt="Sticky pads for SR-P Lite pedals"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> I’m using the pedals as a foot rest to replace a box that I previously used. I used the included sticky pads, and they were pretty effective without the brake mod, but with the brake mod, you will need to mount it to something. The sticky pads are also washable and reusable, so you don’t have to worry about dust getting on them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/sr-p-lite-pedals-mounted-to-wooden-box.JPG"                      alt="SR-P Lite pedals mounted to wooden box"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> I eventually had a wooden box made and bolted the pedals down to that. It’s not pretty, but it gets the job done, and I’m way more consistent with it bolted down. I don’t have to worry about the pedals moving and messing up my inputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-on-edge-of-table.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 on edge of table"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> When I’m done racing, I usually stow it away at the far edge of my desk and unplug the USB and pedal cables. It’s pretty convenient to set up, as I don’t have to move the wheel base far. The wheel can also stay detached, so it’s not in the way all the time. My table is a bit wobbly though, so the monitor gets all shaky, especially when driving Rally cars.</p><h2 id="Quick-Release-System"><a href="#Quick-Release-System" class="headerlink" title="Quick Release System"></a>Quick Release System</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/r5-quick-release.JPG"                      alt="R5 Quick Release"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The quick-release (QR) system is one of the greatest strengths of this wheel over something like the Fanatec CSL DD or the Cammus C5, where you can’t change the wheel. The MOZA R5’s QR is based on the D1 Spec QR system, which is used by real race cars.</p><p> The Fanatec QR system has had many issues, and has since been superceded by their QR2 system, but it’s expensive for something that should be considered standard. For the MOZA R5, having to upgrade the QR system isn’t a consideration.</p><p> The thin black paint on the QR system did eventually get scratched up over a few weeks of use, but that’s to be expected as it’s hard and heavy metal constantly rubbing on each other. Despite the cosmetic damage, I doubt detaching and reattaching wheels would lead to any significant damage. They could probably leave that part unpainted, but that would detract from the overall look of the base.</p><h2 id="MOZA-R5-Bundle-Driving-Experience"><a href="#MOZA-R5-Bundle-Driving-Experience" class="headerlink" title="MOZA R5 Bundle: Driving Experience"></a>MOZA R5 Bundle: Driving Experience</h2><p> Coming from a Logitech G29, the driving experience is wildly different. It’s no longer a clunky mess that feels like it’s about to rattle itself to pieces. It legitimately feels immersive and connected. I’ve separated the driving experience into three sections so I can go into detail for each major component.</p><h3 id="MOZA-R5-Wheel-Base"><a href="#MOZA-R5-Wheel-Base" class="headerlink" title="MOZA R5 Wheel Base"></a>MOZA R5 Wheel Base</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/turning-with-formula-wheel-mod.JPG"                      alt="Turning with Formula Wheel mod"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Before I go into any details, I went from a 1:55 to a 1:51 on Monza in Asssetto Corsa Competizione despite not having driven for over a year. This was even before resetting the wheel base to fix the grainy and self-turning issue.</p><p> The amount of detail you get over a non-direct drive wheel is massive, making you feel a deeper connection with the car. However, as the novelty faded through testing and putting myself in the reviewer mindset, here are my takes:</p><p> The direct drive motor on the R5 provides a lot of detailed feedback, but it is only 5.5 Nm at peak torque and 4.4 Nm sustained. This means that while it does provide a lot of detail, you will need to pay attention to what the wheel is trying to communicate to you. I tend to grip the wheel very lightly, so I don’t dampen out the details. The harder I grip, the less I know what the car is doing since the forces staying on the limit of grip are very subtle.</p><p> That being said, I’m confident I’d be able to reach close to my full potential with just the R5 wheel base. It’s all a matter of my own skill and wrapping my head around what the force feedback is trying to tell me. I wouldn’t have imagined getting this experience for only $499 back when I had my G29, which I bought for around $380 at the time.</p><p> I was able to try the Simagic Alpha Mini at a local tech event before receiving the R5, and I can confidently say that a higher torque wheel base is better. It was more tiring, but I felt the subtle details a lot more clearly. It was also significantly smoother, which I think MOZA could also achieve with some updates.</p><h3 id="MOZA-SR-P-Lite-Pedals-and-Brake-Performance-Kit"><a href="#MOZA-SR-P-Lite-Pedals-and-Brake-Performance-Kit" class="headerlink" title="MOZA SR-P Lite Pedals and Brake Performance Kit"></a>MOZA SR-P Lite Pedals and Brake Performance Kit</h3><p> Considering the prices of the R5 base and the ES Wheel alone are $299 and $129, leaving just $71 for the pedals—the SR-P Lite does its job quite well. Using precise hall-effect sensors and a solid all-metal construction, it’s not a bad set of pedals. However, I do think the pedals are the weakest point of this bundle, and I have a few complaints about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/brake-performance-kit-for-sr-p-lite-pedals.JPG"                      alt="Brake Performance Kit for SR-P Lite pedals"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Firstly, the Brake Performance Kit is a must. Without it, the brake feel is just lacking, and it’s hard to become consistent without some form of resistance. With the brake mod, these are great value pedals and it’ll help you get quite close to your full potential. Heck, even the G29 had a small elastomer in the brake. I do appreciate that you have control over the output curves in the Pit House app though, allowing you to simulate a load cell’s behavior to a certain extent.</p><p> I wanted to maximize my experience, so I had a wooden box made to mount the pedals, but without the hard-mounting, I’d understand that a stiffer pedal is hard to use as it would slip more easily even with the sticky pads.</p><p> I’m pretty disappointed about the pedal faces as well, since it makes it hard to heel and toe if you do decide to get the clutch pedal. However, these shouldn’t be a problem for you if you don’t plan to learn heel and toe or just drive GT3 and Formula 1 cars.</p><p> On the whole, I’d say they’re good enough if you don’t use heel and toe. For beginner to intermediate-level drivers, these are enjoyable and good enough to make you fast and consistent. I’d suggest adding a little lubrication to the hinges to improve the precision, though.</p><h3 id="ES-Steering-Wheel-and-Formula-Wheel-Mod"><a href="#ES-Steering-Wheel-and-Formula-Wheel-Mod" class="headerlink" title="ES Steering Wheel and Formula Wheel Mod"></a>ES Steering Wheel and Formula Wheel Mod</h3><p> The ES Steering Wheel is a great D-shaped rim for a bundled item. I wouldn’t deliberately opt for it, but it’s a great starting point. It offers 22 face buttons, which is plenty for most people.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-front-view.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 front view"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> It’s solid and feels nice, even without gloves. It’s on the smaller side at 11 inches, but on a 5.5Nm base, it allows you to feel the forces better than a larger wheel. I did notice a bit of rattling noise, which makes it feel like a toy, but I only ever noticed it when I drove without sound. However, you can upgrade to a 12-inch round wheel mod for drifting and enlarging the rim.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/driving-with-formula-mod-for-es-steering-wheel.JPG"                      alt="Driving with Formula mod for ES Steering Wheel"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The Formula Wheel Mod is one that I enjoy a lot. I don’t use it all the time since I like having the flexibility of driving Rally cars, but the mod looks and feels good. It uses a rubber grip instead of a leather wrap, but I honestly like this as I don’t have to worry about it breaking down in the future. Using the mod got rid of the rattling noise, and it allows you to see more of the virtual dashboard, which I really appreciate.</p><p> I also like that it has a matte black finish instead of the shiny brushed style on the original ES wheel. I’d be careful driving with it, though, as the thick metal can really hurt the hands during crashes, especially your thumbs.</p><h2 id="Should-You-Buy-the-MOZA-R5-Bundle-and-Are-the-Add-Ons-Worth-It"><a href="#Should-You-Buy-the-MOZA-R5-Bundle-and-Are-the-Add-Ons-Worth-It" class="headerlink" title="Should You Buy the MOZA R5 Bundle, and Are the Add-Ons Worth It?"></a>Should You Buy the MOZA R5 Bundle, and Are the Add-Ons Worth It?</h2><p> The MOZA R5 Bundle at only $499 is amazing value that’s hard to find even from other brands. You’d probably want to go with Fanatec for console support, but I’m not a fan of Fanatec’s expensive upgrade path, locked-down ecosystem, and high shipping fees.</p><p> If you just want to get racing on PC immediately and don’t want to think about upgrades, ordering the base bundle with the Brake Performance Kit and the Formula Wheel Mod are amazing value. However, it does lose value points if you start factoring in upgradability due to the SR-P Lite pedals. While the pedals are a major weak point in this bundle, I still think they’re good enough not to need an upgrade for a while, at least.</p><p> The only thing I don’t really find worth it is the clutch pedal. If you really want a clutch pedal, you’re most likely going to progress into heel and toe downshifting. Unless you plan to get a custom pedal face made, I think you’re better off buying the R5 alone with a table clamp and the SR-P load cell pedals, then using a real steering wheel with a D1 Spec QR, which you can find cheaply online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/moza-r5-on-desk.JPG"                      alt="MOZA R5 on desk"                ></p><h5 id="MOZA-R5-Bundle-1"><a href="#MOZA-R5-Bundle-1" class="headerlink" title="MOZA R5 Bundle"></a>MOZA R5 Bundle</h5><p> 8&#x2F; 10</p><p> $520$700 Save $180</p><p> The MOZA R5 Bundle is a direct-drive sim racing wheel with everything you need to start your sim racing journey.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveil-the-Extraordinary-with-Big-Box-Cabinetry"><a href="#Unveil-the-Extraordinary-with-Big-Box-Cabinetry" class="headerlink" title="Unveil the Extraordinary with Big Box Cabinetry"></a>Unveil the Extraordinary with Big Box Cabinetry</h2><p> If you’re a gamer of a certain age, you likely have fond memories of your local arcade. Clutching your coins, challenging locals, and the rush of a crowd watching you succeed: the arcade delivered an experience unlike any other.</p><p> The good news is modern technology makes it possible to not only replicate those golden years, but make the experience of playing via an arcade even better than you remember. The secret to that sauce is a frontend designed with arcade play in mind, and it’s hard to beat Big Box, courtesy of LaunchBox—here’s why.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets"><a href="#What-Is-Frontend-Software-for-Arcade-Cabinets" class="headerlink" title="What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?"></a>What Is Frontend Software for Arcade Cabinets?</h2><p> Think about the components needed to operate an arcade cabinet. You at least need a joystick with a set of buttons, speakers, a monitor, a cabinet, and a device to run the whole thing, like a desktop. But how do you navigate the system once it’s set up? That’s where frontend software comes in.</p><p> Frontend software finds the games installed on your device, displays them in an easy-to-navigate library, and lets you select each game via your arcade cabinet’s controls alone. It’s the same principle behind the software that allows you to explore your library on a PS5 or via the Steam client on your desktop using a gaming controller.</p><p> A frontend also adds order to the chaos that is your ROM collection. You want to know what you’re going to be playing before you select it. So you need to add key metadata for each game, like the title, platform, thumbnail art, etc., to make everything look nice and tidy.</p><p> This can take days of work alone. But not with Big Box. Let’s dig a bit deeper and learn why a premium subscription to LaunchBox is worth the cost of admission alone for Big Box if you’re setting up your own arcade cabinet.</p><h2 id="1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata"><a href="#1-Big-Box-Automatically-Imports-Metadata" class="headerlink" title="1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata"></a>1. Big Box Automatically Imports Metadata</h2><p> Whether you’ve tackled big projects, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/portable-retro-gaming-console-build-with-raspberry-pi/" >building a portable retro gaming console using a Raspberry Pi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or added a few classic arcade games to your work desktop, you know how painful it is to organize your collection. You are forced to add in every bit of metadata manually in most cases, including hunting down individual bits of media for each game, like a bezel, screenshot, video, and so on.</p><p> It’s painful work, and for those with massive collections, you’ll be more prone to not organize anything. Don’t do that! Organize now to make it easier to find precisely what you want to play, and you’ll use it more frequently than not, guaranteed.</p><p> Leveraging the power of Big Box via EmuMovies automatically finds all of the metadata for each game automatically, allows you to essentially set it and forget it! But you’ll need to be a premium member of both, then link your EmuMovies account to LaunchBox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/configure-emumovies-1.jpg"                      alt="Linking EmuMovies and Launchbox"                ></p><p> Once linked, everything from bezels and marquees to videos, screenshots, and even descriptions about each game will populate each game’s entry. So when you’re searching through your library in Big Box, you get a vibrant, informative listing about each game so you know what you’re about to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/import-flyers-bezels-etc.jpg"                      alt="Importing metadata into Launchbox"                ></p><p> This saves days’ worth of work alone, and means <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/launchbox-premium-worth-buying/" >LaunchBox Premium is worth the cost of admission <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> highly recommend getting a lifetime subscription to both LaunchBox and EmuMovies. You’re looking at $135 for both licenses as of July 2023.</p><p> But in terms of ease-of-use and the time saved alone, it’s going to be money well spent. Especially if you want your arcade cabinet to grow with you as you keep adding games via Steam or another source.</p><h2 id="2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library"><a href="#2-Big-Box-Adds-Context-to-Your-Library" class="headerlink" title="2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library"></a>2. Big Box Adds Context to Your Library</h2><p> Want to know the importance of context? Look at this listing below as an example. If I had not used EmuMovies as I discussed a moment ago, this cabinet would be nothing but a list of games.</p><p> But because I imported the metadata a moment ago, now this listing has a description, trailer, a banner image, and even music from the game. It’s as informative as a listing of an episode or film on your favorite streaming service, making it easy to choose the game you want to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/07/emu-movies-front-page.jpg"                      alt="Game page in EmuMovies"                ></p><p> If you’re already familiar with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-launchbox-how-it-works/" >LaunchBox and how it works <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you already know that you can add custom filters for your games, like the number of players per game or by genre. The filters you create in LaunchBox also appear in Big Box, making it easy to find the right game for the occasion.</p><h2 id="3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls"><a href="#3-Big-Box-Gives-You-Hotkeys-and-Customizable-Menu-Controls" class="headerlink" title="3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls"></a>3. Big Box Gives You Hotkeys and Customizable Menu Controls</h2><p> If you’re building your arcade cabinet for the first time, you’re probably wondering how the heck you’re going to be able to exit a game or adjust the volume. You may think you need dedicated buttons, and while that’s one route, Big Box solves this problem by allowing you to hotkey certain tasks.</p><p> For example, when I want to exit a game, I tap my<strong>Player 1 Start button</strong> and<strong>A button</strong> simultaneously twice to activate the<strong>Close the Active Window</strong> value, which exits my game. I can also do a different button combination for the volume control, among other functions.</p><h2 id="4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees"><a href="#4-Big-Box-Adds-Second-Screen-Support-for-Digital-Marquees" class="headerlink" title="4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees"></a>4. Big Box Adds Second Screen Support for Digital Marquees</h2><p> When you populate your library with metadata via EmuMovies, you probably notice that a marquee file is always downloaded. These files are used with a second screen, displayed as a marquee like a traditional arcade cabinet.</p><p> Once you have <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-dual-monitors/" >set up dual monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your arcade system, go into Big Box then select<strong>Options &gt; General &gt; Marquee Screen &gt; Screen 2</strong> . Now, whenever you highlight a game in Big Box, your second screen will display the marquee for that particular game, usually reflective of the cabinet it was in during its heyday. It’s a nice touch that goes a long way toward making your cabinet feel authentic yet new.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/second-screen-marquee-big-box.jpg"                      alt="Example of a second screen marquee in BigBox"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Unbroken Software LLC&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1gBLJ2IZJI" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell"><a href="#5-Use-Big-Box-In-Place-of-Your-Windows-Shell" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell"></a>5. Use Big Box In-Place of Your Windows Shell</h2><p> You don’t want to have to use a mouse to open Big Box every time your start the device running your cabinet. It’s preferable if you can dive right into your arcade cabinet’s frontend with as few steps as possible. Fortunately, Big Box makes it happen if your arcade cabinet is powered by Windows.</p><p> First, be sure that the device powering your arcade cabinet automatically logs into your account. For example, there are a few <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/automatically-sign-user-in-windows-10/" >ways to automatically sign into your account in Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Whatever operating system you are using, be sure it automatically logs in every time the device starts.</p><p> Next, start Big Box from LaunchBox. Then, go to <strong>System &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Enable Using Big Box as the Windows Shell &gt; Yes.</strong> The next time you reboot your device, Big Box will replace the Windows shell. If you need to get into Windows, you can still close Big Box via the Task Manager to gain access to Windows again.</p><h2 id="Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends"><a href="#Big-Box-Takes-the-Headache-Out-of-Arcade-Frontends" class="headerlink" title="Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends"></a>Big Box Takes the Headache Out of Arcade Frontends</h2><p> The amount of time and frustration saved alone is worth the cost of admission for LaunchBox and EmuMovies. It’s layered tidily in Big Box, making navigating your library of games via arcade controls so easy, you’ll wonder why other frontends are so complicated. Give it a shot, and you’ll become one of the converted.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-steams-missing-game-detections/"><u>Resolving Steam's Missing Game Detections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/personalize-ps5-interface-colors/"><u>Personalize PS5 Interface Colors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/next-gen-energy-top-choice-charger-kits-for-sonys-ps5-controller/"><u>Next-Gen Energy: Top Choice Charger Kits for Sony's PS5 Controller</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/play-by-the-seat-of-your-pants-with-classic-psp-on-iphone/"><u>Play by the Seat of Your Pants with Classic PSP on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/secure-silent-gaming-with-xbox-series-xs/"><u>Secure Silent Gaming with Xbox Series X/S</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/simplify-fun-enter-the-realm-of-idles/"><u>Simplify Fun: Enter the Realm of Idles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/boost-your-gaming-with-an-immersive-multiplayer-adventure-using-ea-play-ps5/"><u>Boost Your Gaming with an Immersive Multiplayer Adventure Using EA Play PS5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719170667310-discovering-nvidias-latest-app-elevate-your-gameplay/"><u>Discovering Nvidia's Latest App: Elevate Your Gameplay!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-controller-enabled-phone-games-selection/"><u>Top Controller-Enabled Phone Games Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-spotify-location-after-moving-to-another-country-on-nubia-z50s-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Nubia Z50S Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-track-motorola-moto-g13-without-app-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Ways to Track Motorola Moto G13 without App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/demystifying-ai-game-generators-from-definition-to-distinction-for-2024/"><u>Demystifying AI Game Generators From Definition to Distinction for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-world-of-wide-web-watching-via-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the World of Wide Web Watching via FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-advanced-video-snapper-windows/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Advanced Video Snapper (Windows)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-social-sensation-skills-making-a-buzz-on-your-profiles-wall/"><u>[Updated] Social Sensation Skills  Making a Buzz on Your Profile's Wall</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-video-recording-and-editing-basics-with-adobe-connect/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Video Recording & Editing Basics with Adobe Connect</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-excellence-started-with-quality-cameras-and-lenses-for-2024/"><u>Video Excellence Started with Quality Cameras and Lenses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/elevating-your-gaming-the-xbox-recorder-playbook/"><u>Elevating Your Gaming  The Xbox Recorder Playbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-free-avi-video-rotators-for-windows-mac-android-and-iphone-in-year/"><u>In 2024, The Best Free AVI Video Rotators for Windows, MAC, Android, and iPhone in Year</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Many soccer fanatics and more casual players still adore that retro game because it’s both an accessible yet in-depth soccer management simulator that’s not overly complex, with many playable leagues and a big database of players.</p><p> Eidos Interactive made Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 a freely available download from 2008, and online communities have kept this classic retro game alive and kicking ever since. This is how you can play the Championship Manager 01&#x2F;02 soccer management game on a Windows 11&#x2F;10 PC.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP"><a href="#1-Download-and-Extract-the-Championship-Manager-01-02-ZIP" class="headerlink" title="1.

The entire case is solid and durable, though it is a bit bland, as it features nothing more than a semi-transparent exterior and small Nintendo Switch branding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hori-switch-holder.png"                      alt="HORI Switch Holder"                ></p><h5 id="Hori-Game-Card-Case-1"><a href="#Hori-Game-Card-Case-1" class="headerlink" title="Hori Game Card Case"></a>Hori Game Card Case</h5><p>Best Overall</p><p> The Hori Game Card Case holds up to 24 cards, is reasonably priced, and is officially licensed by Nintendo, making it the ideal way to store all your games.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Officially licensed by Nintendo</li><li>Holds up to 24 cartridges</li><li>Compact size</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Bland design</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Game-Nintendo-Switch-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01NASY99Z?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$10 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Nintendo-Switch-Cartridge-Holder-Hyperkin-8-in-1-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case"><a href="#Best-Budget-Nintendo-Switch-Cartridge-Holder-Hyperkin-8-in-1-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case"></a>Best Budget Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hyperkin-catridge-holder.jpg"                      alt="Hyperkin catridge holder"                ></p><p>Hyperkin</p><p> It doesn’t carry many games, but the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/8-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07TR7H11H?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is both affordable and compact. It can hold eight cartridges, is built from thick and durable plastic, and features well-designed slots that allow for easy access while still securing your games in place. Eight cartridges might be a bit on the low end for Switch owners who’ve been playing for years, but when you consider how cheap the case is, there’s no denying it poses great value.</p><p> Hyperkin is also a trusted name in the third-party product market, with a variety of popular controllers, cases, and portable consoles in its catalog. That means you shouldn’t have any reliability issues with the 8-in-1 carrying case even though it’s the cheapest cartridge holder on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hyperkin-switch-holder.png"                      alt="Hyperkin Switch Holder"                ></p><h5 id="Hyperkin-8-in-1-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-1"><a href="#Hyperkin-8-in-1-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-1" class="headerlink" title="Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case"></a>Hyperkin 8-in-1 Retro Style Cartridge Case</h5><p>Best Budget</p><p> Though it only holds eight games, the Hyperkin Retro Style Cartridge Case is durable, secure, and highly affordable.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Secure slots and durable exterior</li><li>Great price</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Only holds 8 games</li><li>Boring design</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/8-Retro-Style-Cartridge-Case-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07TR7H11H?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032179&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-nintendo-switch-cartridge-holders/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$10 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Most-Compact-Nintendo-Switch-Cartridge-Holder-Amazon-Basics-Game-Storage-Case"><a href="#Most-Compact-Nintendo-Switch-Cartridge-Holder-Amazon-Basics-Game-Storage-Case" class="headerlink" title="Most Compact Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Amazon Basics Game Storage Case"></a>Most Compact Nintendo Switch Cartridge Holder: Amazon Basics Game Storage Case</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/amazon-basics-catridge-holder.jpg"                      alt="Amazon Basics Catridge Holder"                ></p><p>Amazon</p><p> Amazon seems to make everything these days, but you might be shocked to learn that it also has a lineup of Switch storage cases.

Aside from that quirk, there’s little to dislike here. At just over three inches wide and three inches long, it’s one of the most compact cases on the market.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Obstacles-Preventing-GameFi-From-Gaming-Audience"><a href="#5-Obstacles-Preventing-GameFi-From-Gaming-Audience" class="headerlink" title="5 Obstacles Preventing GameFi From Gaming Audience"></a>5 Obstacles Preventing GameFi From Gaming Audience</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>GameFi’s potential among gamers is limited due to token instability, as crypto assets are known for their price fluctuations. This means that users could potentially lose a significant amount of value earned through gameplay.</li><li>Scams are a prevalent issue in the GameFi space, with phony games, scam tokens, and compromised user safety being a real concern. Criminals can take advantage of the popularity of P2E games and deceive users for financial gain.</li><li>High transaction fees associated with crypto transactions can discourage gamers from entering the GameFi space, as a significant portion of their earnings would be consumed by these fees. This loss of earnings is not appealing to gamers looking to make money through gameplay.</li><li>The focus on earning money through gameplay can shift the priority away from the actual gaming experience. This can potentially lead to developers neglecting game quality, introducing bugs, or providing poor progression, diminishing the overall enjoyment for gamers.</li><li>5. GameFi lacks proper regulation, leaving gamers vulnerable to different risks. Malicious actors can take advantage of loopholes, and even legitimate developers may evade responsibility if promises or financial obligations fall through. Regulation is needed to protect gamers and create a safer environment.</li><li>Overall, GameFi faces challenges that make its future uncertain. While improvements are possible if developers address the issues, the inherent risks and drawbacks of the crypto industry present significant obstacles.</li></ul><p> Crypto and gaming both form huge parts of the tech industry, and combining the two has given way to GameFi. GameFi has some exciting attributes, but there are several reasons why it doesn’t have much potential among gamers.</p><p> So, what are the problems with GameFi, and why will they seal its fate?</p><h2 id="What-Is-GameFi"><a href="#What-Is-GameFi" class="headerlink" title="What Is GameFi?"></a>What Is GameFi?</h2><p> GameFi (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gamefi/" >short for gaming finance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is a blend of the gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries, wherein users can play games to earn crypto tokens and other decentralized assets, such as NFTs. GameFi allows blockchain-based apps to shift into the gaming industry, attracting users with the lure of digital tokens.</p><p> GameFi is also known as <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/are-play-to-earn-games-legit/" >play-to-earn (P2E) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . P2E games often look and perform like typical games, with the tokenomics element usually being the only difference.</p><p> Some notable examples of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/top-play-to-earn-mobile-crypto-games/" >popular P2E games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are Axie Infinity, Star Atlas, and Tamadodge. Each of these games has one or more of their own token types that users can earn. Some games, including Axie Infinity, reward winners with NFTs that they can sell for Ethereum or another cryptocurrency.</p><p> In P2E games, almost everything can be tokenized, from avatars to weapons to land. You can often receive these assets by completing quests and winning tournaments, but the nature of the P2E model changes from game to game.</p><p> While GameFi may seem innovative, many downsides affect players and investors.</p><h2 id="1-Token-Instability"><a href="#1-Token-Instability" class="headerlink" title="1. Token Instability"></a>1. Token Instability</h2><p> If there’s one thing we can all agree on about crypto, it’s that assets are almost always unstable in price. From new, smaller tokens to market leaders like Bitcoin, price fluctuations have been a problem from the beginning.</p><p> This naturally affects GameFi, as many P2E games reward users with crypto tokens. If a GameFi token’s price increases, that’s great news for gamers. But as we all know, cryptocurrency price drops and market crashes are by no means rare. If an individual spends hours building a solid holding of assets by playing a P2E game, much of their time and effort will go to waste if the reward token loses a large chunk of its value.</p><p> Even if a P2E game solely rewards users with NFTs, cryptocurrency price fluctuations directly affect how much a user can get through the sale of their P2E NFTs. For instance, if an NFT is worth 2 ETH and Ethereum’s price drops by 10%, the NFT owner stands to lose 10% of their original profit when they <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-nft-marketplaces-buying-all-kinds-digital-assets/" >sell this NFT on a marketplace <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like OpenSea.</p><p> GameFi developers could aim to adopt stablecoins over regular cryptos in P2E games, as this provides more price stability and protects users from really suffering when the market turns downward.</p><h2 id="2-Scams"><a href="#2-Scams" class="headerlink" title="2. Scams"></a>2. Scams</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/crypto-scams-social-media.jpg"                      alt="person having crypto stolen from laptop"                ></p><p> Scams are, unfortunately, native to the crypto realm, and GameFi is no exception to this rule. If there’s money to be stolen, chances are criminals will find some way to access it.</p><p> This is where phony P2E games, scam tokens, and compromised user safety come into play. While developing a game from scratch takes time, it’s not difficult to create a scam website that alleges to host a great P2E game with high rewards.</p><p> It’s also important to remember that many criminals are tech-savvy, so developing a simple yet shady P2E game, especially as part of a group effort, isn’t out of the question.</p><p> What’s more, a P2E game may be harmless in and of itself, but the tokens being earned by players will soon drop in value. For instance, malicious operators can launch a game and reward players with Token A. Token A has a decent value, which draws in users. The P2E game is played for weeks or months, and the increasing player base boosts Token A’s price further.</p><p> At this point, all seems well. But in the background, malicious operators have kept a large proportion of Token A’s supply to themselves. Now, when Token A reaches a peak price, the operators will sell their majority holding, causing the circulating supply to skyrocket. Now, Token A’s price will crash, leaving unsuspecting players with worthless earnings.</p><p> Some big names have been associated with P2E scandals, including YouTuber Logan Paul.</p><p> Paul, along with a team of developers and marketers, developed the CryptoZoo P2E game, wherein players could buy NFT “eggs” and breed new animal avatars to earn ZOO tokens.</p><p> People invested in CryptoZoo but lost thousands when it was revealed that Paul and his development team had effectively (allegedly) rug-pulled investors. Investors are yet to be refunded, and a lawsuit has been filed.</p><h3 id="3-High-Transaction-Fees"><a href="#3-High-Transaction-Fees" class="headerlink" title="3. High Transaction Fees"></a>3. High Transaction Fees</h3><p> You’ll almost always incur a fee when you conduct a crypto transaction. Some cryptos have low fees, whereas others can reach unreasonable levels. Transaction fees usually increase or decrease with a blockchain network’s transaction demand. Other factors, such as the size of the transaction, also play a role here.</p><p> Higher transaction fees can put people off getting into GameFi, as a large chunk of their earnings will be stripped away through these mandatory charges. It’s a loss and isn’t something that attracts gamers.</p><h3 id="4-Prioritizing-Money-Over-the-Game"><a href="#4-Prioritizing-Money-Over-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="4. Prioritizing Money Over the Game"></a>4. Prioritizing Money Over the Game</h3><p> Naturally, when a game offers digital assets in return for playtime, users will put the earnings at the front and center of why they play the game.</p><p> There’s nothing inherently wrong with this, but avid gamers may argue that adding real-world tokenomics to a video game somewhat removes the heart of it. Developers may choose to cut corners by leaving in bugs or providing poor game progression, factors which can severely affect the enjoyment and satisfaction people receive when they game.</p><h3 id="5-Lack-of-Regulation"><a href="#5-Lack-of-Regulation" class="headerlink" title="5. Lack of Regulation"></a>5. Lack of Regulation</h3><p> Cryptocurrency and DeFi already lack proper regulation (though <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-government-sec-going-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/" >crypto regulation may soon change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), but GameFi, a newer addition to the blockchain industry, suffers from this issue even more.</p><p> In the US, no specific legal regulations surround GameFi, which could allow malicious actors to get away with a fair few swindles. Even legitimate game developers may be able to wriggle through a few loopholes without proper regulation, leaving gamers worse off.</p><p> For instance, an individual may spend months playing a P2E game they love, amassing a solid holding of tokens or NFTs. But when the time comes to cash out by selling these assets on an exchange or NFT marketplace, it turns out that their value has plummeted due to a drop in demand.</p><p> This isn’t anyone’s fault, but the developer can dodge any liability when gamers ask for compensation. If the game has made any financial promises, the developers may also be able to keep their hands clean if these promises fall through.</p><h2 id="Will-GameFi-Last"><a href="#Will-GameFi-Last" class="headerlink" title="Will GameFi Last?"></a>Will GameFi Last?</h2><p> No one knows for sure if GameFi will sink or swim, but the nature of this sector makes long-term success difficult.</p><p> There’s certainly a cycle that seems to limit the lifespan of P2E games. Many P2E games use the funds spent by preexisting players to reward new players. This model only lasts so long as the game keeps doing very well, and the funds keep coming in—it’s basically a Ponzi scheme.</p><p> A drop in players or asset demand leaves game operators with a shortage of funds, meaning they have no funds or assets with which to reward. This can lead to the game’s downfall.</p><p> Even without this model, crypto token instability always poses a risk to P2E games. Take Illuvium, for example. This popular P2E game hit news headlines in August 2023 when its in-game token, ILV, suffered a big drop in value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/illuvium-price-graph.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of coinmarketcap illuvium seven day price graph"                ></p><p> Between August 14 and 22, the price of one ILV token went from $53 to $42, a drop of almost 21% in just over a week. This drop doesn’t seem to be the result of any major scandal or market crash. Rather, it seems to be a product of a lack of interest.</p><p> It’s been a while since Illuvium’s developers have given gamers anything new, with many getting bored with waiting. While top-tier games without the P2E structure focus heavily on user satisfaction and experience, P2E developers often have more of a focus on increasing the in-game token value.</p><h2 id="GameFi’s-Future-Is-Precarious"><a href="#GameFi’s-Future-Is-Precarious" class="headerlink" title="GameFi’s Future Is Precarious"></a>GameFi’s Future Is Precarious</h2><p> While GameFi isn’t dead in the water yet, its many drawbacks have placed its future in a shaky position. If GameFi developers listen to criticism, things may improve, but the nature of the crypto industry, along with constant scams, still poses many risks and challenges.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/game-on-office-seat-style/"><u>Game on, Office Seat Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-your-opera-experience-with-a-trial-of-free-nitro-membership/"><u>Enhance Your Opera Experience with a Trial of Free Nitro Membership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719170974624-discover-the-joy-of-gaming-youtubes-new-minigames-invite-you-to-play/"><u>Discover the Joy of Gaming: YouTube’s New Minigames Invite You to Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/reviving-video-game-classics-on-a-budget-a-pi-story/"><u>Reviving Video Game Classics on a Budget - A Pi Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-hunt-down-gamers-a-steams-journey/"><u>How to Hunt Down Gamers: A Steam's Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/from-broken-to-superior-reviving-xbox-d-pads/"><u>From Broken to Superior - Reviving Xbox D-Pads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steam-decks-new-frontier-external-memory-expansion/"><u>Steam Deck's New Frontier: External Memory Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/customize-your-interactive-language-in-steam/"><u>Customize Your Interactive Language in Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/supercharge-live-streams-select-best-7-bots-for-twitch-expertise/"><u>Supercharge Live Streams: Select Best 7 Bots For Twitch Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/get-to-know-the-new-ps5-slim-must-know-details/"><u>Get to Know The New PS5 Slim: Must-Know Details</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-youtube-audio-library-you-wont-miss/"><u>Updated YouTube Audio Library You Wont Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/most-effective-5-image-editing-programs-on-iphone-x-7-8/"><u>Most Effective 5 Image Editing Programs on iPhone (X, 7, 8)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-guided-process-importing-snapchats-into-local-gallery/"><u>In 2024, Guided Process  Importing Snapchats Into Local Gallery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-finding-repository-of-explosive-roar-samples/"><u>Updated In 2024, Finding Repository of Explosive Roar Samples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-free-scape-discovering-the-artistic-no-money-backdrops-of-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, FREE-Scape  Discovering the Artistic No-Money Backdrops of TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-fixing-shorts-the-thumbnail-not-showing-dilemma-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fixing Shorts  The Thumbnail Not Showing Dilemma for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-how-to-stabilize-shaky-videos-in-after-effects-3-ways/"><u>New How to Stabilize Shaky Videos in After Effects 3 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-optimal-method-integrating-links-into-tiktok-bios/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Optimal Method  Integrating Links Into TikTok Bios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-optimizing-video-meetings-with-tighter-focus-areas/"><u>[New] Optimizing Video Meetings with Tighter Focus Areas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-vimeos-potential-screen-and-webcam-capture-mastery/"><u>Unlocking Vimeo's Potential  Screen and Webcam Capture Mastery</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="20-Creative-Messaging-Match-Ups-for-Friendly-Banter"><a href="#20-Creative-Messaging-Match-Ups-for-Friendly-Banter" class="headerlink" title="20 Creative Messaging Match-Ups for Friendly Banter"></a>20 Creative Messaging Match-Ups for Friendly Banter</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Play text-based games with friends using SMS text messaging or chat apps like WhatsApp or iMessage. There’s no need to download another app!</li><li>You can play classic games everyone will have heard of, like 20 Questions, I Spy, Song Lyrics, Kiss, Marry, Kill, and What If…?</li><li>Keep yourself entertained with more original ideas, such as Story Builder, Simple Quiz, Abbreviations, Where Am I?, and List Builder.</li></ul><p> While there is an app for everything, you don’t need to download any apps to play games with your friends. Text-based games can provide hours of fun, and all you need is SMS text messaging or a chat app such as WhatsApp or iMessage.</p><p> While there are plenty of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-mobile-games-no-ads/" >free mobile games without ads or in-app purchases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you may want to play something even simpler. The uncomplicated games listed below can be played over text or chat without the need to download and install yet another app on your phone.</p><p> If you play these in a messaging app, you’re also not limited to just two participants. Suggest playing one of these in a group chat with family or friends, and you suddenly have a multiplayer option open to you.</p><h2 id="1-Story-Builder"><a href="#1-Story-Builder" class="headerlink" title="1 Story Builder"></a>1 Story Builder</h2><p>Close</p><p> As a writer, I tell stories for fun. But even non-writers who aren’t used to creating worlds, characters, and plots by themselves could gain enjoyment from this simple-yet-effective game.</p><p> With<strong>Story Builder</strong> , one of you begins the story by messaging an opening sentence to the other person. The other person then messages the second sentence in the story back to the first person. Slowly but surely, the two of you build a story over the course of several texts or a messaging thread.</p><p> Variations of this game include sentences containing a certain number of words or characters, or sentences with exactly 160 characters in them (which, as quaint as it sounds these days, is how many characters a single SMS text message can handle).</p><h2 id="2-20-Questions"><a href="#2-20-Questions" class="headerlink" title="2 20 Questions"></a>2 20 Questions</h2><p>Close</p><p> This is the classic<strong>20 Questions</strong> that originated in the US and spawned various radio and television shows. The concept of this game is simple, and yet it requires a degree of intelligence to succeed.</p><p> One of you thinks of an object or a person, while the other fires questions at them via text or messages. Your “Yes&#x2F;No” responses help the guesser narrow down the possibilities until they can make an educated guess as to exactly what it is you were thinking of.</p><p> Variations include limiting the object being thought of to a particular genre. Or, you can increase&#x2F;decrease the number of questions the guesser can ask. Feel free to experiment, and take the game in new and interesting ways.</p><h2 id="3-I-Spy"><a href="#3-I-Spy" class="headerlink" title="3 I Spy"></a>3 I Spy</h2><p>Close</p><p> This is the classic<strong>I Spy</strong> , a game that has been a favorite of families for generations. Surely we have all whiled away a long car journey as a child doing this. And the version played via text or a chat app is just as much fun.</p><p> Begin by telling your opponent where you are to at least give them a fighting chance of succeeding. Then look around your environment until your eye fixes on something in particular. Your opponent then has to guess what thing you have spied, with only the first letter of the object to guess from.</p><p> Variations of I Spy include giving clues after each negative response to a wrong guess or limiting the number of guesses allowed.</p><h2 id="4-Song-Lyrics"><a href="#4-Song-Lyrics" class="headerlink" title="4 Song Lyrics"></a>4 Song Lyrics</h2><p>Close</p><p> Assuming you’re not exclusively interested in instrumental music, you should know certain lines from certain songs. Whether because of an emotional attachment or simply because they sound good together, most people have been affected by song lyrics in some way.</p><p> The<strong>Song Lyrics</strong> game plays on that by having one person quote lines from a song to the other via text or in a messaging thread. The other person then has to guess the song the lyrics are from. It helps if this is played with someone you’re close to or with whom you share similar music tastes. Because if you choose a metal song, your classical music-loving mother is unlikely to ever guess correctly.</p><p> Variations include quoting classic lines from movies or plots from games instead of lyrics from songs. Failure to guess correctly could mean having to phone up and sing the chorus of the song to your opponent. A fate all but the biggest reality TV wannabe would surely want to avoid.</p><h2 id="5-Abbreviations"><a href="#5-Abbreviations" class="headerlink" title="5 Abbreviations"></a>5 Abbreviations</h2><p>Close</p><p> Abbreviations are everywhere, as you can see from our list of <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/30-trendy-internet-acronyms-slang-need-know-fit/" >internet acronyms you need to know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s even possible to abbreviate your entire life by describing what you are up to with just the first letters of each word in that description.</p><p> To play<strong>Abbreviations</strong> , one of you abbreviates the activity you’re currently engaged in. For example: “In a coffee shop in town” becomes “IACSIT”, and the other person sets about trying to un-abbreviate your short sentence back to its original form. Be prepared for some rude replies and some long message threads.</p><p> Variations include giving more than just the first letter of each word, and abbreviating something other than your current activity. Such as what you truly think of the person you are playing against. Whatever variant you play, the key is to steer the guesser in the right direction.</p><h2 id="6-List-Builder"><a href="#6-List-Builder" class="headerlink" title="6 List Builder"></a>6 List Builder</h2><p>Close</p><p> We all make lists of some kind. They detail everything from our chores for the day to our overall aims in life; from what groceries we need to the gadgets we want to buy in the future. When turned into a game,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/format-manage-lists-microsoft-word/" >making lists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a lot of fun; especially in a message thread.</p><p><strong>List Builder</strong> is a competitive game in which each player takes a turn to name something belonging to a particular genre. This could include capital cities, actors from a certain series of movies, or anything else your mind can conjure up. The winner is the last person to successfully add an item to the list. Once someone taps out because they can’t think of anything, the game ends.</p><p> Variations include going through the alphabet one letter at a time, or requiring the next answer to start with the same letter the last answer ended with.</p><h2 id="7-Where-Am-I"><a href="#7-Where-Am-I" class="headerlink" title="7 Where Am I?"></a>7 Where Am I?</h2><p>Close</p><p> The reason we all carry smartphones with us everywhere we go is that we’re not always at home. This makes this game perfect for playing on your mobile device.</p><p> With<strong>Where Am I?</strong> , each player takes it, in turn, to describe one feature of their surroundings, while the other tries to guess where they are. You can make this game as easy or as hard as you like by varying the level of detail you give to your opponent.</p><p> Variations of the game include limiting your surroundings to a house, with the room you’re in being the correct answer, or asking which shop in town you are in. You could also change it to<strong>Who Am I With?</strong> by describing the person or people who are there with you instead.</p><h2 id="8-Kiss-Marry-Kill"><a href="#8-Kiss-Marry-Kill" class="headerlink" title="8 Kiss, Marry, Kill"></a>8 Kiss, Marry, Kill</h2><p>Close</p><p> You may know of<strong>Kiss, Marry, Kill</strong> as something else. The “Kiss,” for instance, may be a word implying something more than just a peck on the cheek. However, the basic concept is the same, and it is fun as long as no offense is taken by the answers given.</p><p> One person names three people, be they celebrities or individuals you both know, and asks, “Kiss, Marry, Kill?” The other person then has to determine which of the three they would kiss, which they would marry, and which they would kill. All in jest, you understand. None of the three are actually going to happen.</p><p> Variations include dropping certain names into the mix you know will upset your friend. Or changing the question entirely. As long as there are three choices and three names in the mix, the sky’s the limit with this one.</p><h2 id="9-What-If…"><a href="#9-What-If…" class="headerlink" title="9 What If…?"></a>9 What If…?</h2><p>Close</p><p> If you’re prone to daydreaming (which, let’s face it, we all are), you should be familiar with the concept of<strong>What If?</strong> Once one of these scenarios pops into your brain, you can spend several minutes working out which option you would choose in that scenario. This is perfect fodder for a texting game.</p><p> One of you messages the other a What If? scenario and asks what they would do in that situation. There are no correct or incorrect answers here. It’s not only fun to see the responses given, it can also give you an insight into your friend or family member’s outlook on life.</p><p> Variations include leaving the question open-ended with any answer possible, or giving multiple-choice answers and forcing the other person to choose from one of those.</p><h2 id="10-Simple-Quiz"><a href="#10-Simple-Quiz" class="headerlink" title="10 Simple Quiz"></a>10 Simple Quiz</h2><p>Close</p><p> Quizzes of any kind can be fun, even if they’re supposedly testing your IQ level. And they don’t have to be long, drawn-out affairs with a quiz master asking difficult questions and enjoying watching you struggle to find the answers.</p><p> In the form of a texting game you can play on a chat app,<strong>Simple Quiz</strong> requires one of you to message the other a general knowledge question. The other person then has to try to give the correct answer, or, if they don’t know, the funniest joke answer imaginable.</p><p> Variations include switching this to a test of web browsing skills as they try to find the answer online in the shortest time possible.</p><p> These games range from the simple to the more complex.

Here are some things to consider before buying a handheld gaming console and how to choose which one is best for you.</p><h2 id="1-Decide-on-Your-Budget"><a href="#1-Decide-on-Your-Budget" class="headerlink" title="1 Decide on Your Budget"></a>1 Decide on Your Budget</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rog-ally.jpg"                      alt="rog ally"                ></p><p> Hannah Stryker &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> This question is often the most significant deciding factor on which handheld console you’re buying or if you’re buying one in the first place. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X cost $500 a piece, with both offering 1TB storage. On the other hand, the top-of-the-line Nintendo Switch is priced at $350 but only comes with 64GB of internal storage.</p><p> If you prefer PC games or titles available on Steam, the Steam Deck starts at $400 for the 256GB model. But if you want the 1TB model, you must pay $650—$150 more than the PS5 or the Xbox Series X.</p><p> The base-model ROG Ally is priced at $500—the same as the PS5 and Xbox Series X—but has a more powerful processor than those consoles. The ROG Ally with the Z1 Extreme chip costs $700, but it’s even more powerful, allowing you to play newer AAA games. While both ROG Ally models only have a 512GB SSD, they both have a microSD slot, allowing you to expand their storage.</p><p> Although these may look pricey, they’re still cheaper than you’ll spend building a gaming PC. According to our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/well-rounded-pc-buying-guide/" >well-rounded PC buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll likely pay about $1,000 to build a mid-range gaming PC, while higher-end builds could start at $1,500 or more. However, desktop PCs are more likely to last longer, as you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/upgrades-will-improve-pc-performance/" >upgrade your PC to improve its performance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the future.</p><h2 id="2-Choose-Which-Games-You-Want-to-Play"><a href="#2-Choose-Which-Games-You-Want-to-Play" class="headerlink" title="2 Choose Which Games You Want to Play"></a>2 Choose Which Games You Want to Play</h2><p> Before buying a handheld console, you must consider which games you like. If you’re into PlayStation exclusives, you’re pretty much stuck with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-sony-playstation-portal-handheld/" >the PlayStation Portal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> unless you want to use PlayStation Plus to stream games to Windows-based handhelds, like <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-asus-rog-ally/" >the Asus ROG Ally <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> On the other hand, Nintendo fans will likely stick with the Switch, especially as the company isn’t a fan of emulators and has continuously blocked and sued emulator developers. If most of your game library is on Steam, then the Steam Deck makes sense as your primary gaming handheld choice.</p><p> If you want to run games that are not on Steam and don’t want to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-install-windows-on-steam-deck/" >install Windows on your Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can pick other handhelds like the ROG Ally or MSI Claw, which are portable Windows computers. That way, you’ll have more leeway to install the apps you like.</p><p> However, not all games are optimized for handheld gaming, even if you can install them on one of these consoles. This is especially true for <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-real-time-strategy-games-rts-games/" >real-time strategy games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , often designed to be played on a larger screen with a mouse and keyboard. If these are the games you like, we suggest sticking to your PC or at least getting a console dock, like these <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-rog-ally-docks/" >great ROG Ally docks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a genuine Valve Docking Station for the Steam Deck.</p><h2 id="3-Determine-Whether-You-Want-to-Use-a-Dock"><a href="#3-Determine-Whether-You-Want-to-Use-a-Dock" class="headerlink" title="3 Determine Whether You Want to Use a Dock"></a>3 Determine Whether You Want to Use a Dock</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/valve-steam-deck-docked.jpg"                      alt="valve steam deck docked"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" >Valve <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While handheld gaming consoles give you portability and let you play anywhere, it’s often better to game on a large TV screen. If you don’t have another gaming console attached to your TV or don’t want to spend money on multiple gaming devices, consider getting a handheld that works with a dock.</p><p> The best example of a handheld design for docked gaming is the Nintendo Switch. Even though <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/the-nintendo-switch-is-6-years-old-celebrating-the-popular-game-console/" >the Switch is already a six-year-old console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s still an excellent device for both portable and console gaming, especially as it comes with a dock in the box. You also don’t need to purchase separate controllers, as the Switch’s built-in controllers slide off to let two people play simultaneously.</p><p> But if the games you like aren’t Nintendo games, consider getting a handheld console that you can attach to a larger screen through a dock or cable. That way, you can enjoy gaming on a larger screen when available. However, note that you might need a controller or a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to enjoy gaming on your TV via your handheld, so you should consider these additional expenses if you don’t have them yet.</p><h2 id="4-Check-How-Long-Your-Gaming-Sessions-Last"><a href="#4-Check-How-Long-Your-Gaming-Sessions-Last" class="headerlink" title="4 Check How Long Your Gaming Sessions Last"></a>4 Check How Long Your Gaming Sessions Last</h2><p> The biggest advantage of a gaming handheld is that you can play your games anywhere you are. But the caveat here is that you can only play for so long before you need to recharge.</p><p> For example,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-review-ultimate-portable-gaming-console/" >our Steam Deck review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> showed that it only lasts about an hour and a half when playing some demanding titles, so you’ll have to plug it into the wall to continue playing (or bring a massive power bank with you).</p><p> Of course, the handheld’s portability still is a significant advantage over a gaming desktop or laptop. That’s because you can just pull out your handheld console from your bag to start playing.</p><p> But if your games use a lot of battery power, the handheld’s portability advantage diminishes, as you need to find an outlet to recharge it while you’re playing. But if you only play games for less than an hour a day or prefer older, simpler games that don’t require that much power, then a handheld gaming console will make sense for you.</p><h2 id="5-Check-the-Specs"><a href="#5-Check-the-Specs" class="headerlink" title="5 Check the Specs"></a>5 Check the Specs</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/02/steam-deck-ssd-installed-without-sleeve-1.JPG"                      alt="Steam Deck SSD installed without sleeve"                ></p><p> Jhet Borja&#x2F;MakeUseOf  </p><p> If you’ve decided to buy a handheld gaming console, don’t forget to check the specifications of your options. That’s because not all gaming consoles are made the same.</p><p> For example, the PlayStation Portal only works via streaming—meaning it will stream games from your PlayStation 5. So, if you don’t have a strong internet connection at home and at the places where you intend to use the Portal, it’s not a suitable handheld for you.</p><p> The Logitech G Cloud is also a primarily streaming device. That means you’ll need a high-speed internet connection and a game streaming subscription before you can even game on it.</p><p> If you want to play games even if you’re offline, consider getting a device that stores games locally, like the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or ROG Ally. However, you should also check the storage capacity of the device you’re getting, see if it has expandable memory, or see if you could upgrade its storage.</p><p> Other handhelds, like the ROG Ally, also give you processor options. So you should check the games you’re playing and see if it’s worth going for the more powerful (and expensive) handheld or if you should settle for the more affordable base model.</p><p> If you just want a portable gaming device to play on today and don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on a gaming rig, then buying a gaming handheld is the sensible choice. Just ensure that you’ve considered the things we’ve listed above so that you can pick the right device for you and avoid buyer’s remorse.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/streamlining-your-playstyle-for-cs2-on-mac/"><u>Streamlining Your Playstyle for CS2 on Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719166266886-mastering-new-york-times-word-challenge-unlock-your-brain/"><u>Mastering New York Times: Word Challenge - Unlock Your Brain</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bargain-buying-bonanza-for-gamers-top-11-low-cost-video-game-retailers/"><u>Bargain Buying Bonanza for Gamers - Top 11 Low-Cost Video Game Retailers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/step-by-step-playing-legacy-xbox-games-on-pc/"><u>Step-by-Step: Playing Legacy Xbox Games on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bring-back-childhood-fun-with-iphone-gaming-classics/"><u>Bring Back Childhood Fun with iPhone Gaming Classics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/chatgpt-and-dungeons-6-secrets-to-perfect-assistantship/"><u>ChatGPT & Dungeons: 6 Secrets to Perfect Assistantship</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/join-the-fun-why-netflixs-gameplay-seduces-us/"><u>Join the Fun: Why Netflix's Gameplay Seduces Us</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-best-15-online-photo-editors-you-should-try/"><u>[New] Best 15 Online Photo Editors You Should Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-audio-capture-devices-win-and-mac-edition/"><u>Updated Top 10 Audio Capture Devices Win & Mac Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-interpreting-the-purpose-behind-a-facebooks-blue-video-icon/"><u>2024 Approved  Interpreting the Purpose Behind a Facebook's Blue Video Icon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-audio-edition-understanding-avs-softwares-core-strengths-and-evaluating-other-choices-for-2024/"><u>New The Ultimate Audio Edition Understanding AVS Softwares Core Strengths and Evaluating Other Choices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-optimizing-your-viewing-experience-amazon-prime-video-aspect-ratio-guide/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Optimizing Your Viewing Experience Amazon Prime Video Aspect Ratio Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-for-people-wanting-to-mock-gps-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-devices-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, For People Wanting to Mock GPS on Samsung Galaxy F04 Devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-quick-creation-of-fortnite-visuals/"><u>[New] Quick Creation of Fortnite Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/play-store-stuck-on-downloading-of-vivo-s17-pro-7-ways-to-resolve-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Play Store Stuck on Downloading Of Vivo S17 Pro? 7 Ways to Resolve | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Access-Advantages-Analysis-Xbox-Game-Pass-Vs-PS-Essential-Comparison"><a href="#Access-Advantages-Analysis-Xbox-Game-Pass-Vs-PS-Essential-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Access Advantages Analysis: Xbox Game Pass Vs. PS+ Essential Comparison"></a>Access Advantages Analysis: Xbox Game Pass Vs. PS+ Essential Comparison</h2><p> Both the PlayStation and Xbox platforms offer great games and plenty of features out of the box. But to get the most out of your PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, or Xbox One, you need to sign up for their premium services: PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass, respectively.</p><p> If you’re considering buying a new console, its premium service could help you decide which one to get. Let’s compare PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass to see what they offer you.</p><h2 id="PlayStation-Plus-and-Xbox-Live-Gold-Have-Changed"><a href="#PlayStation-Plus-and-Xbox-Live-Gold-Have-Changed" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold Have Changed"></a>PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold Have Changed</h2><p> In September 2023,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-live-gold-is-becoming-xbox-game-pass-core-what-you-need-to-know/" >Microsoft retired the long-running Xbox Live Gold name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the Xbox’s online service. In its place is a new tier of Xbox Game Pass, called Game Pass Core. Similarly, in June 2022,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/new-playstation-plus-subscriptions-explained/" >PlayStation Plus expanded to include three different tiers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The base tier of PlayStation Plus (Essential) is most similar to Game Pass Core. As a result, we’ll spend most of this comparison on PS Plus Essential and Game Pass Core, then briefly cover the other tiers at the end.</p><h2 id="PlayStation-Plus-Essential-and-Game-Pass-Core-Basics"><a href="#PlayStation-Plus-Essential-and-Game-Pass-Core-Basics" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Plus Essential and Game Pass Core: Basics"></a>PlayStation Plus Essential and Game Pass Core: Basics</h2><p> Neither PlayStation Plus nor Game Pass Core are required for the basic functionality of your console. You can enjoy media apps like Netflix and Spotify, buy digital games, and play single-player titles without subscribing.</p><p> The PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S consoles all allow you to share certain benefits of one subscription with every user on the console. As long as you designate your console as your primary system and keep your subscription active, anyone using it can play games online without having to pay for their own subscription. For more, we’ve shown <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-game-sharing-playstation-5/" >how to gameshare on PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-gameshare-on-xbox-series-x/" >how to gameshare on Xbox Series consoles <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p>Let’s walk through the primary benefits of both services.</p><h2 id="Access-to-Online-Multiplayer-for-Paid-Titles"><a href="#Access-to-Online-Multiplayer-for-Paid-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Access to Online Multiplayer (for Paid Titles)"></a>Access to Online Multiplayer (for Paid Titles)</h2><p> The key benefit to both PS Plus and Game Pass Core is online multiplayer. On the PS4 and PS5, as well as the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, the relevant service is required for all online multiplayer in paid games, whether competitive or cooperative.</p><p> Thankfully, PlayStation and Xbox both let you enjoy free-to-play multiplayer games like Fortnite and Rocket League online without a subscription. Only paid games require a membership for online play.</p><h2 id="“Free”-Games-Are-Included"><a href="#“Free”-Games-Are-Included" class="headerlink" title="“Free” Games Are Included"></a>“Free” Games Are Included</h2><p> Both PlayStation Plus and Game Pass Core offer “free” games (included as part of the cost) with your subscription. However, these work differently across the two services.</p><h3 id="PlayStation-Plus-Free-Games"><a href="#PlayStation-Plus-Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Plus Free Games"></a>PlayStation Plus Free Games</h3><p> Each month, PlayStation Plus subscribers get to add a few free games to their library. Since the PlayStation 5’s launch, there have been three games per month. Generally, two of them are PS4 games, with at least one PS5 title that may also have a PS4 version.</p><p> The new PS Plus games arrive on the first Tuesday of each month and stay available until the first Tuesday of the following month. As long as you add the games to your library when they’re free, they’re yours to keep as long as your Plus subscription stays active.</p><p> If you let your subscription lapse, you’ll lose access to any free Plus games you grabbed. However, should you ever re-subscribe, you’ll get access to those games again.</p><h3 id="Game-Pass-Core’s-Included-Catalog"><a href="#Game-Pass-Core’s-Included-Catalog" class="headerlink" title="Game Pass Core’s Included Catalog"></a>Game Pass Core’s Included Catalog</h3><p> Under Xbox Live Gold, Microsoft offered a similar setup, called Games with Gold, that provided you with “free” titles every month. This isn’t the case under Game Pass Core; instead, there is a small catalog of titles you can enjoy with your subscription.</p><p> Game Pass Core includes “more than 25 titles” across a range of genres. Microsoft has stated that these may vary across regions, and more titles will be added a few times per year. At launch in September 2023, some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Doom Eternal</li><li>Fallout 4</li><li>Forza Horizon 4</li><li>Ori &amp; The Will of the Wisps</li><li>Psychonauts 2</li></ul><p> If you previously subscribed to Xbox Live Gold, any Xbox 360 titles you claimed through Games With Gold are yours to keep. You can still access Xbox One titles as long as you stay subscribed to Game Pass Core (or Ultimate).</p><h2 id="Digital-Game-Discounts"><a href="#Digital-Game-Discounts" class="headerlink" title="Digital Game Discounts"></a>Digital Game Discounts</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PS-Plus-Discounts-Store.png"                      alt="PS Plus Discounts on Store"                ></p><p> In addition to the free games, PlayStation Plus and Game Pass Core both offer a variety of discounts on their respective digital stores.</p><p> Of course, there are differences in the frequency and volume of what’s available. It’s hard to compare the services directly in this area, as the sales vary in frequency and value. You might find a Game Pass-exclusive sale on the Microsoft Store, or deeper discounts with PlayStation Plus than non-members get.</p><p> These discounts extend to DLC and consumable items, so it’s not just full titles. With PS Plus, you’ll also sometimes get exclusive access to betas, plus some freebies like add-ons for various games or profile avatars.</p><h2 id="Other-Subscription-Features"><a href="#Other-Subscription-Features" class="headerlink" title="Other Subscription Features"></a>Other Subscription Features</h2><p> We’ve covered the main features above, but PlayStation Plus and Game Pass Core both have a few other considerations to keep in mind.</p><h3 id="Cloud-Save-Storage"><a href="#Cloud-Save-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Cloud Save Storage"></a>Cloud Save Storage</h3><p> PlayStation Plus gives you space to store your game saves in the cloud. Subscribers get 100GB for PS4 saves and another 100GB for PS5 saves. This space allows you to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/protect-your-game-saves/" >back up your precious save data <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as well as easily transfer your saves to another console.</p><p> However, both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S provide cloud storage without a subscription. Microsoft says “as your game library grows, so does your cloud storage,” so the exact amount isn’t known.</p><h3 id="Party-Chat-and-Share-Play"><a href="#Party-Chat-and-Share-Play" class="headerlink" title="Party Chat and Share Play"></a>Party Chat and Share Play</h3><p> On both PS4 and PS5, even without PS Plus, you can create parties to chat with your friends no matter what game you’re playing. Xbox consoles also allow you to do this; you don’t need Xbox Game Pass to join a party and chat with friends.</p><p> PlayStation also offers a pair of features called Share Screen and Share Play. Share Screen lets friends watch you play games, while Share Play lets someone else take control of a game—they can either take over from you or join as a second player in local play.</p><p> You need PlayStation Plus to host a Share Play session. Both people need PS Plus to use the “play a game together” feature.</p><h3 id="PlayStation-Game-Help"><a href="#PlayStation-Game-Help" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation Game Help"></a>PlayStation Game Help</h3><p> The PS5 has a feature called Game Help that lets you see tips and tricks for supported games. It works without leaving your current game, so you don’t have to pull up a separate walkthrough in the browser.</p><p> This isn’t available on PS4, and requires a PS Plus subscription to use on PS5.</p><h3 id="Automatic-Updates-and-Other-Perks"><a href="#Automatic-Updates-and-Other-Perks" class="headerlink" title="Automatic Updates and Other Perks"></a>Automatic Updates and Other Perks</h3><p> Finally, PS Plus enables some convenient features on PS4 and PS5, such as automatically downloading game updates in Rest mode. It also gives you priority shipping if you order physical goods from Sony’s online store.</p><h2 id="The-Cost-of-PS-Plus-and-Game-Pass-Core"><a href="#The-Cost-of-PS-Plus-and-Game-Pass-Core" class="headerlink" title="The Cost of PS Plus and Game Pass Core"></a>The Cost of PS Plus and Game Pass Core</h2><p> For a long time, the retail price of Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus Essential was the same: $60 per year. However, this has changed as of 2023.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-much-does-playstation-plus-cost/" >PlayStation Plus’s pricing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has seen a major hike across all its tiers.</p><p> As of this writing, PlayStation Plus Essential costs $80&#x2F;year when you subscribe annually. Meanwhile, Xbox Game Pass Core has the same $60&#x2F;year price as Xbox Live Gold did.</p><p> If you’re patient, you can likely spot deals on either service that let you save $10 or more on a yearly subscription. As a result, you shouldn’t ever have to pay full price, especially if you wait to renew your subscription until Black Friday or other seasonal sales.</p><p> You can join either service on a monthly basis, but this ends up costing a lot more. Both services cost $10&#x2F;month when paid monthly, while PS Plus Essential also offers a 3-month plan for $25. Unless you’re only looking to play online for a short time, paying yearly makes much more sense.</p><h2 id="Other-Xbox-Game-Pass-and-PlayStation-Plus-Plans"><a href="#Other-Xbox-Game-Pass-and-PlayStation-Plus-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Other Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Plans"></a>Other Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Plans</h2><p> As mentioned above, we’ve looked at PlayStation Plus Essential and Xbox Game Pass Core here, but there are other plans available for each service.</p><p> PlayStation Plus Extra ($135&#x2F;year) includes access to hundreds of PS4 and PS5 games via the Game Catalog, while PS Plus Premium ($160&#x2F;year) tacks on a library of classic titles from every PlayStation generation. Both include the same online multiplayer benefits.</p><p> On the Xbox side, you can sign up for Game Pass for Console ($11&#x2F;month) or PC Game Pass ($10&#x2F;month). While both of these include access to hundreds of games, neither lets you play online on Xbox. If you want the full Game Pass catalog as well as access to online play, you’ll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription ($17&#x2F;month). This includes full Game Pass access on both Xbox and PC, plus access to online multiplayer on console.</p><p> See our <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-xbox-game-pass-everything-need-know/" >overview of Xbox Game Pass <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-plus-essential-vs-extra-vs-premium/" >comparison of the PlayStation Plus tiers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for full details about each of them.</p><p> Depending on what you’re interested in, both of these options can provide more value than the base subscription. If you’re interested in even a few of the games available on the service for your console, it’s cheaper to play them through this service than to buy them outright.</p><p> We’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/playstation-now-vs-xbox-game-pass/" >compared Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a deeper look at both, including how their streaming offerings differ.</p><h2 id="Premium-Gaming-With-PS-Plus-and-Xbox-Game-Pass"><a href="#Premium-Gaming-With-PS-Plus-and-Xbox-Game-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Premium Gaming With PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass"></a>Premium Gaming With PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass</h2><p> Now you know what PlayStation Plus and Game Pass Core each offer, and can decide whether they’re worthwhile for you.</p><p> There’s no real “winner” between the two services, but they do have some small differences. Either one is required for online multiplayer, and the free games and discounts are effectively a wash. With free-to-play games and party chat now available at no cost on either system, there are fewer differences than ever.</p><p> Xbox including cloud saves without a subscription is nice, though PlayStation Plus does offer a few perks that Xbox doesn’t match. It’s up to your preferences whether PlayStation’s hit-or-miss monthly “free” games beat out a small but solid selection of titles with Game Pass Core.</p><p> Whichever system you play on, you’ll get a lot of value out of either service.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/strategies-to-simulate-steam-disconnection/"><u>Strategies to Simulate Steam Disconnection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/addressing-non-responsive-controllers-in-windows-environment/"><u>Addressing Non-Responsive Controllers in Windows Environment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/meta-in-gaming-decoded-what-it-is-and-should-you-comply/"><u>Meta in Gaming Decoded: What It Is & Should You Comply?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elite-frame-rate-165hz-monitors/"><u>Elite Frame Rate 165Hz Monitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elite-xbox-joysticks-compared-2024/"><u>Elite Xbox Joysticks Compared 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-excellence-with-nvidias-novel-gaming-app/"><u>Unlocking Excellence with Nvidia's Novel Gaming App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/a-guide-for-parents-to-monitor-children-on-discord/"><u>A Guide for Parents to Monitor Children on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-the-future-of-gaming-streamline-your-experience-with-steam-and-meta-quest/"><u>Discover the Future of Gaming: Streamline Your Experience with Steam and Meta Quest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-imei-unlokers-for-your-htc-u23-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top IMEI Unlokers for Your HTC U23 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlock-the-full-content-masterful-techniques-to-download-igtv-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlock the Full Content  Masterful Techniques to Download IGTV Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/111-must-learn-croatian-language-skills-before-your-next-trip-to-the-coastal-paradise/"><u>111 Must-Learn Croatian Language Skills Before Your Next Trip to the Coastal Paradise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/planning-to-use-a-pokemon-go-joystick-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Samsung Galaxy A05s? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-earnings-update-navigating-youtube-monetization/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Earnings Update  Navigating YouTube Monetization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-quickcapture-stop-and-save-screenshot-command/"><u>[Updated] QuickCapture  Stop & Save Screenshot Command</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-tiktok-viral-videos-on-twitter/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 TikTok Viral Videos on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dynamic-viewership-statistics-platforms/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Dynamic Viewership Statistics Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-androidprocessmedia-has-stopped-on-infinix-note-30-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Android.Process.Media Has Stopped on Infinix Note 30 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In the Steam desktop client, click<strong>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Remote Play</strong> . Now, toggle on the<strong>Enable Remote Play</strong> option if it’s disabled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/enabling-remote-play-in-steam-desktop-app.jpg"                      alt="Enabling Remote Play in Steam desktop app"                ></p><h3 id="Setting-Up-the-Steam-Link-App"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Steam-Link-App" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Steam Link App"></a>Setting Up the Steam Link App</h3><p> Open the Steam Link app and tap<strong>Allow &gt; Get Started</strong> .

First, adjust the streaming settings of the Steam Link app itself. In the Steam Link app, tap<strong>Settings (gear icon) &gt; Streaming</strong> , then choose either<strong>Default</strong> ,<strong>Enhanced 1080p</strong> , or<strong>Enhanced 4K</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/steam-link-streaming-settings-1.jpg"                      alt="Streaming settings in the Steam Link app"                ></p><p> Additionally, you can adjust the streaming options on your computer. In the Steam desktop client, click<strong>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Remote Play</strong> .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Comprehensible-Guide-for-Itch-io’s-Great-Gaming-Finds"><a href="#A-Comprehensible-Guide-for-Itch-io’s-Great-Gaming-Finds" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensible Guide for Itch.io’s Great Gaming Finds"></a>A Comprehensible Guide for Itch.io’s Great Gaming Finds</h2><h3 id="Quick-Links"><a href="#Quick-Links" class="headerlink" title="Quick Links"></a>Quick Links</h3><ul><li><a href="#use-tags-and-filters">Use Tags and Filters</a></li><li><a href="#check-out-game-bundles">Check Out Game Bundles</a></li><li><a href="#check-the-itch-io-blog">Check the itch.io Blog</a></li><li><a href="#check-out-game-jams">Check Out Game Jams</a></li><li><a href="#follow-developers">Follow Developers</a></li><li><a href="#look-at-user-reviews-and-ratings">Look at User Reviews and Ratings</a></li><li><a href="#check-out-community-recommendations">Check Out Community Recommendations</a></li></ul><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Find indie games on itch.io using tags that describe the genre of the game.</li><li>Check out game bundles on itch.io for discounted packages containing multiple games, offering a variety of titles at a lower price.</li><li>Keep an eye on game jams on itch.io to discover hidden gems for free, showcasing unique and innovative indie games from different genres.</li></ul><p> Many independent game developers display their fun, creative, and unique experiences on itch.io. However, the platform’s saturation can make it hard to find great titles. Try these methods I use to discover indie games worth playing on itch.io.</p><h2 id="1-Use-Tags-and-Filters"><a href="#1-Use-Tags-and-Filters" class="headerlink" title="1 Use Tags and Filters"></a>1 Use Tags and Filters</h2><p> On itch.io, you can use various tags and filters to find great indie games. I am a big fan of <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-roguelike-and-roguelite-video-games/" >roguelite video games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so I use the<strong>Roguelite</strong> tag to ensure I only see the relevant results.</p><p> On the itch.io homepage, you will find the frequently used tags in the<strong>Popular Tags</strong> section on the left. But if you want to search for a particular tag, click the<strong>Browse All Tags</strong> link.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itch-io-home-page.png"                      alt="The itch.io homepage."                ></p><p> Click the<strong>Find Tag</strong> dropdown in the top-right corner and select the tag you want (e.g.,<strong>2D</strong> ,<strong>Platformer</strong> ,<strong>Action</strong> ,<strong>Puzzle</strong> ,<strong>Horror</strong> ,<strong>Visual</strong> <strong>Novel</strong> , and<strong>Adventure</strong>).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/search-indie-tag-itch.png"                      alt="Searching for the tags on itch.io."                ></p><p> You can add more tags to refine your search further. To do that, click the<strong>Select a Tag</strong> dropdown and choose the tags you want (you can also search for them).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/add-roguelite-tag-itch.png"                      alt="Adding tags to a search on itch.io."                ></p><p> The games will be sorted by what’s popular, but to find the great games, I usually look at the<strong>Top Rated</strong> and<strong>Top Sellers</strong> tabs. This has led me to discover fun roguelites like <a class="link"   href="https://aquadiun.itch.io/corebreaker" >Corebreaker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://overboy.itch.io/xenopunch" >Xenopunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Check-Out-Game-Bundles"><a href="#2-Check-Out-Game-Bundles" class="headerlink" title="2 Check Out Game Bundles"></a>2 Check Out Game Bundles</h2><p> The itch.io website has a <a class="link"   href="https://itch.io/bundles" >Bundles page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where you can find game bundles created by developers. These are promotional packages containing multiple games. Each bundle is sold at a discounted price, and when you purchase it, you get instant access to all the games.</p><h2 id="3-Check-the-itch-io-Blog"><a href="#3-Check-the-itch-io-Blog" class="headerlink" title="3 Check the itch.io Blog"></a>3 Check the itch.io Blog</h2><p> The <a class="link"   href="http://itch.io/blog" >itch.io blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a surprisingly good place to find sales and bundles of some great indie games. These promotions are curated based on various themes, such as winter, summer, Halloween, or Valentine’s Day. The blog also highlights “Games of the Week,” where the team curates several great indie games for you to try.</p><h2 id="4-Check-Out-Game-Jams"><a href="#4-Check-Out-Game-Jams" class="headerlink" title="4 Check Out Game Jams"></a>4 Check Out Game Jams</h2><p> Game jams are a fantastic way to discover hidden gems for free. On itch.io, game jams take place throughout the year, so keep your eye on the <a class="link"   href="https://itch.io/jams" >Game Jams page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to see upcoming events on the calendar. Look for past game jams to try highly rated game submissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/past-game-jams-itch.png"                      alt="The page to see past game jams on itch.io."                ></p><p> These game jams usually have creative and innovative indie games from different genres. Developers usually display talent in crafting unique experiences at these events. Fun games I have discovered through game jams on itch.io include <a class="link"   href="https://featurekreep.itch.io/inside-job" >Inside Job <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://aramilion.itch.io/bready-or-not-unsurvivor" >Bready or not - unSURVIVOR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and <a class="link"   href="https://kyboon.itch.io/let-there-be-cat" >Let There Be Cat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Since these are game jams, don’t expect fully fleshed-out games with lots of content and complex features. Developers usually have time constraints and a limited scope to work with, as well as specific problems to solve. Many enter them to learn about game development and to tackle unique challenges.</p><h2 id="5-Follow-Developers"><a href="#5-Follow-Developers" class="headerlink" title="5 Follow Developers"></a>5 Follow Developers</h2><p> If a particular indie developer has a game you like, you can follow them to stay updated on their latest releases. This allows you to see what games they have in their collections and those they have rated highly.</p><p> Another way to discover developers to follow is by looking at your feed, which shows you recommendations based on your activity on itch.io. I usually switch to the<strong>Featured Games Feed</strong> or<strong>Global Feed</strong> tab to see what is trending based on my interests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/itch-feed-featured-games.png"                      alt="The feed on itch.io showing featured games."                ></p><p> Keep in mind that this feed doesn’t only show games, but things like asset packs and comics as well.</p><h2 id="6-Look-at-User-Reviews-and-Ratings"><a href="#6-Look-at-User-Reviews-and-Ratings" class="headerlink" title="6 Look at User Reviews and Ratings"></a>6 Look at User Reviews and Ratings</h2><p> If you have a problem deciding whether a game is good, you can look at its rating. On the game’s itch.io page, scroll down past the description and click<strong>More Information</strong> . Here, you can see how many users rated the game (out of five stars).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/more-information-game-itch.png"                      alt="A game&#39;s page on itch.io showing more information so the rating can be seen."                ></p><p> You can also scroll down to the comments to see the sentiments around the game. Also, it can be a fantastic way to interact with the developer.</p><h2 id="7-Check-Out-Community-Recommendations"><a href="#7-Check-Out-Community-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="7 Check Out Community Recommendations"></a>7 Check Out Community Recommendations</h2><p> The itch.io community has the <a class="link"   href="https://itch.io/board/13293/recommend-a-game" >Recommend a Game page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This is where people post games that they’ve enjoyed and why. It’s a good place to see the discussion around the game, ask questions, and even find people and developers to follow.</p><p> Keep in mind that itch.io is just one of the many platforms to find great indie games. You can also find them on Steam, PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Xbox Marketplace, Nintendo eShop, and others. And If you love itch.io for its free games, there’s also a way to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-free-games-on-steam/" >find free games on Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/steams-ultimate-visual-experience-big-picture/"><u>Steam’s Ultimate Visual Experience: Big Picture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/8-revolutionary-features-of-edge-for-gamers/"><u>8 Revolutionary Features of Edge for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/fixing-xboxs-unresponsive-d-pad-drift/"><u>Fixing Xbox's Unresponsive D-Pad Drift</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-duality-of-pimax-crystal-headset-sharpness-vs-stability/"><u>The Duality of Pimax Crystal Headset: Sharpness vs Stability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/sony-ps5-audio-via-bluetooth-technology/"><u>Sony PS5 Audio via Bluetooth Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/deciphering-amds-rdna-35-tech-details-and-launch-estimates/"><u>Deciphering AMD’s RDNA 3.5: Tech Details and Launch Estimates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unwinding-through-play-six-burnout-remedies/"><u>Unwinding Through Play: Six Burnout Remedies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/8-secrets-to-dominate-the-new-york-social-chess-game/"><u>8 Secrets to Dominate the New York Social Chess Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-app-not-available-in-your-country-play-store-problem-on-itel-a60-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix App Not Available in Your Country Play Store Problem on Itel A60 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-master-video-trimming-with-kapwings-online-editor/"><u>Updated In 2024, Master Video Trimming with Kapwings Online Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/boosting-obs-streams-direct-to-facebook-feed/"><u>Boosting OBS Streams Direct to Facebook Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-fake-gps-location-apps-on-android-of-your-tecno-spark-go-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Fake GPS Location Apps on Android Of your Tecno Spark Go (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-online-video-converter-for-instagram/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Online Video Converter for Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-watchers-whispers-essential-websites-for-got-sound-files/"><u>[New] The Watchers' Whispers  Essential Websites for GoT Sound Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-how-android-enables-seamless-screen-capturing-for-2024/"><u>[New] How Android Enables Seamless Screen Capturing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-best-route-generator-apps-you-should-try-on-vivo-s18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Best Route Generator Apps You Should Try On Vivo S18 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-video-editing-mastery-on-mac-os-x-mavericks-edition/"><u>Updated Video Editing Mastery on Mac OS X Mavericks Edition</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-Up-Your-Game-With-These-Unique-ChatGPT-Titles"><a href="#Step-Up-Your-Game-With-These-Unique-ChatGPT-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Step Up Your Game With These Unique ChatGPT Titles"></a>Step Up Your Game With These Unique ChatGPT Titles</h2><h3 id="Quick-Links"><a href="#Quick-Links" class="headerlink" title="Quick Links"></a>Quick Links</h3><ul><li><a href="#murder-mystery-mayhem">Murder Mystery Mayhem</a></li><li><a href="#oregon-trail">Oregon Trail</a></li><li><a href="#poker">Poker</a></li><li><a href="#console-gpt">Console GPT</a></li><li><a href="#cookie-clicker">Cookie Clicker</a></li><li><a href="#cute-little-zombies">Cute Little Zombies</a></li></ul><p> Bored of using ChatGPT for programming, chatting, and learning? It’s time to start using it for gaming instead.</p><p> ChatGPT has a wealth of games in its custom GPT store, covering everything from, RPGs and Dungeons and Dragons-style adventures, classic retro games, card games, quizzes, mysteries, and so much more.</p><h2 id="1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem"><a href="#1-Murder-Mystery-Mayhem" class="headerlink" title="1. Murder Mystery Mayhem"></a>1. Murder Mystery Mayhem</h2><p> Let’s start with one of the top-rated games on ChatGPT’s custom GPT store. Murder Mystery Mayhem is a procedurally generated game where you play the role of a detective in the year 1925.</p><p>Close</p><p> As with all good investigations, Murder Mystery Mayhem begins by setting the scene, including an image of the scene and the six suspects, along with names, roles, and potential interview points. You then begin questioning each suspect, attempting to find holes in their story, check alibis, and uncover crucial evidence.</p><p> The story isn’t completely linear, but you don’t have much room to develop your detective’s character. I wrote that “I was pacing the room, looking at each suspect in turn, trying to detect a tell, anger, or worry,” but was informed that was outside the boundaries of the game by the Officer (the police officer present at the investigation with you).</p><p> Once you finger your suspect, you call in the Officer to make the arrest. Collar the wrong perp, and the game is over, and you begin with a new mystery.</p><p> Murder Mystery Mayhem is good fun, with the location and murderer changing round by round, and each suspect has new alibis and evidence to reveal. The changes keep it feeling fresh, and one game played through to the end can keep you engaged and seeking the truth for well over an hour. (Don’t forget, you don’t have to play it all at once!)</p><h2 id="2-Oregon-Trail"><a href="#2-Oregon-Trail" class="headerlink" title="2. Oregon Trail"></a>2. Oregon Trail</h2><p> Dying of dysentery has become a longstanding meme from the original Oregon Trail game, but you can now relive that horrifying experience in ChatGPT. The Oregan Trail custom GPT brings one of the first edu-games (not_the_ first, mind!) to ChatGPT… where you can suffer through the wilderness all over again.</p><p>Close</p><p> You begin as the Oregon Trail does: choosing your character and buying supplies, then heading out into the wilderness. Most of your input to the game is choosing between the numbered options, such as where to head next, whether to buy more supplies, explore a new area, hunt for supplies, talk to the locals, look at the map, and so on.</p><p> It’s a basic version of the classic game, but it’s engaging enough. The custom GPT’s scripting doesn’t allow you to go off-piste and, say, rob the local convenience store for supplies (nor did the original), but it’s certainly a lot easier without so many setbacks constantly upending and destroying your party. It’s a much easier version, that’s for sure.</p><h2 id="3-Poker"><a href="#3-Poker" class="headerlink" title="3. Poker"></a>3. Poker</h2><p> From the potential death and horror of the Oregon Trail to something a little more relaxing: Poker. You play against the AI in this Poker custom GPT, starting with 10,000 credits, and play standard five-card Texas hold’em until someone’s credits run out.</p><p>Close</p><p> My only major gripe about this poker game is that ChatGPT seems to mimic your choices, such as check, raise, and so on, which can make the game predictable (or at least less random).</p><h2 id="4-Console-GPT"><a href="#4-Console-GPT" class="headerlink" title="4. Console GPT"></a>4. Console GPT</h2><p> Now, this is a cool idea of how a custom GPT can span multiple types of input to create a custom game with a unique storyline.</p><p> When you first boot Console GPT, you meet the message “BOOT UP AND INSERT GAME.” But you don’t have a game cartridge to boot yet. Instead, you have to head to the <a class="link"   href="https://glif.app/@fab1an/glifs/clotu9ul2002vl90fh6cmpjw0" >Console GPT Glif page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a custom AI art tool that will create your “cartridge.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cyber-syndicate-cartridge-ai-image.jpg"                      alt="cyber syndicate cartridge ai image"                ></p><p> Input the type of game you want in the text box, select<strong>Glif It!</strong> , and watch as your creation comes to life. I went with “retro-futurism crime lord” and was presented with “Cyber Syndicate,” a game where you “navigate a neon-soaked, cyberpunk metropolis teeming with high-tech heists and digital espionage,” with a goal of becoming the ultimate syndicate leader.</p><p> Now, download the Cyber Syndicate cartridge (as an image; it’s not really a cartridge file) by hovering over the image and selecting<strong>Download</strong> .</p><p> Head back to Console GPT and use the image upload button to insert the cartridge. For me, Cyber Syndicate instantly whirrs into life, declaring “COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE DETECTED. LOADING ‘CYBER SYNDICATE.’” The first scenario boots along with a 70 percent full health bar, three options, and, most interestingly, the option to visualize the scene.</p><p>Close</p><p> The narrative flow is a bit shaky, and Console GPT could use some extra commands to remember other parts of the story, but it’s good fun for a while. For example, one moment, I was a lone operative in a bar, and the next, I was planning a heist in a room with the rest of my assembled team.</p><h2 id="5-Cookie-Clicker"><a href="#5-Cookie-Clicker" class="headerlink" title="5. Cookie Clicker"></a>5. Cookie Clicker</h2><p> Not content with card games, custom cartridge adventures, or adventuring? Why not give a custom GPT idle game a try instead?</p><p>Close</p><p> I have to say, this implementation of Cookie Clicker is jarring. Cookie Clicker is one of the most well-known idle games of all time, building up your cookie income over time.</p><p> The custom GPT Cookie Clicker is decidedly different. You’re still building up a cookie empire in a similar style, but because ChatGPT doesn’t run automated commands and cannot keep the numbers ticking over like the original game, it requires more input.</p><p> Still, if you’re into idle games and want to try something different, it could be worth a try.</p><h2 id="6-Cute-Little-Zombies"><a href="#6-Cute-Little-Zombies" class="headerlink" title="6. Cute Little Zombies"></a>6. Cute Little Zombies</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://adventureinked.wixsite.com/gpts/" >Adventure Inked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has developed more than 200 ChatGPT text adventure games, so there are far too many to list here. Cute Little Zombies is a perfect example of why its text adventures are great, giving you a heap of different scenarios to play through, all with cute little AI-generated images to help build the story out.</p><p>Close</p><p> You’re first presented with a list to choose your preferred type of zombie apocalypse. Perhaps you prefer a “Classic Horde,” or maybe you’re more into a “Biotech Disaster” or “Apocalyptic Cult?” Either way, Cute Little Zombies’ list of eight scenarios has you covered. Once you select, the game sets the scene, dropping you into a world filled with ravenous zombies, ready to make you one of their own.</p><p> What I like about Cute Little Zombies is that along with the numbered action options, it also makes it clear you can enter another action you want to take, which helps make the game a little more personal. Plus, the images created within the custom GPT game are ridiculously cute, and the storytelling is decent. I mean, it’s not going to win any prizes for writing, but it’s good enough to draw you in.</p><p> Gaming on ChatGPT is fun, but there is one major frustration that cannot be escaped: ChatGPT’s input limit. As you can only send ChatGPT Plus a limited number of messages (around 40 every three hours), any in-depth gaming will be interrupted periodically to reset the counter. The counter doesn’t roll over, either. You’re not building up extra hours of ChatGPT messages by not messaging; ChatGPT tracks your usage from when you send your first message during a session.</p><p> ChatGPT’s games are entertaining, and custom GPT games can add an extra dimension with some clever designs, but that limit means you’ll always have more fun with a regular game instead.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/customization-mastery-the-ultimate-guide-to-personalizing-the-xbox-game-bar-in-windows/"><u>Customization Mastery: The Ultimate Guide to Personalizing the Xbox Game Bar in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/peak-into-vrs-expensive-ecosystem-exploring-four-factors/"><u>Peak Into VR's Expensive Ecosystem: Exploring Four Factors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719172767277-enhance-csgo-on-pc-10-frames-up/"><u>Enhance CS:GO on PC - 10 Frames Up!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/7-strategies-to-maximize-your-fps-in-csgo/"><u>7 Strategies to Maximize Your FPS in CS:GO</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-cost-dynamics-in-game-purchases-on-steam/"><u>Analyzing the Cost Dynamics in Game Purchases on Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/using-smart-technology-for-xbox-controller-free-use/"><u>Using Smart Technology for Xbox Controller-Free Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719170557511-prioritize-these-five-game-changing-mouse-features-today/"><u>Prioritize These Five Game-Changing Mouse Features Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unraveling-cloud-synch-issues-in-steam-devices/"><u>Unraveling Cloud Synch Issues in Steam Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-the-dynamic-evolution-in-mmo-worlds/"><u>Exploring the Dynamic Evolution in MMO Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/mobile-identification-showdown-iphone-x-and-galaxy/"><u>Mobile Identification Showdown  IPhone X and Galaxy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/attention-stirrer-supreme/"><u>Attention Stirrer Supreme</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-reimagining-your-video-presentation-update-facebook-covers-today-for-2024/"><u>[New] Reimagining Your Video Presentation  Update Facebook Covers Today for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/easy-methods-for-saving-online-meetings-for-2024/"><u>Easy Methods for Saving Online Meetings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/ispoofer-is-not-working-on-infinix-note-30-5g-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iSpoofer is not working On Infinix Note 30 5G?
