And that’s okay. Everyone deserves a little alone time every once in a while. But you don’t want to seem rude and just flat-out ignore your friends as you see their chat box pop up on Steam.</p><p> Thankfully, there is a way that you can make yourself appear offline on Steam, even when you’re online. That way, you can experience all the joys of being online without having to worry about anyone trying to bother you during your alone time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Would-I-Want-to-Appear-Offline-on-Steam"><a href="#Why-Would-I-Want-to-Appear-Offline-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="Why Would I Want to Appear Offline on Steam?"></a>Why Would I Want to Appear Offline on Steam?</h2><p> There is a way that you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-steam-offline-mode" >play games fully offline on Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . But the problem is that when you actually go offline on Steam, you are unable to play any games that require an internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/13632811731c559bc127701456401507af159186a9de22e1aa59a5e7f9127b24.jpg"                      alt="A Person Playing A Game On Computer"                ></p><p> That means no Among Us, no Apex Legends, and no Valorant.

Appearing offline allows you to play games without them being advertised to all your friends and family. So, if you’re ever indulging in your guilty-pleasure game and don’t want others to know, appearing offline will take that stress off your shoulders.</p><p> Appearing offline means you can still play anything you want without any of your Steam friends being able to tell you’re online, so you’re able to fully enjoy Steam, incognito style.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Appear-Offline-on-Steam-Even-When-I’m-Online"><a href="#How-Do-I-Appear-Offline-on-Steam-Even-When-I’m-Online" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Appear Offline on Steam Even When I’m Online?"></a>How Do I Appear Offline on Steam Even When I’m Online?</h2><p> Appearing offline on Steam is incredibly fast and simple, and you will probably have it done by the time anyone even realizes you were online in the first place.

But what exactly is it? And how does it affect your gameplay?</p><p> So, let’s explore what a procedurally generated world is, how it works, and a few examples of games that use this technology.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Procedural-Generation"><a href="#What-Is-Procedural-Generation" class="headerlink" title="What Is Procedural Generation?"></a>What Is Procedural Generation?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/procedurally-generated-game-map.jpg"                      alt="procedurally generated game map"                ></p><p> Most games have manually-created worlds, like the Grand Theft Auto series and Call of Duty. This means that each and every loaded game will look the same, no matter how many times you play it.</p><p> While this is crucial for games that mimic reality or for esports titles that focus on player skill, it also means that you can only play a game so many times until you get bored. Furthermore, a sizeable manually-created map means a large game file. For example, GTA V’s San Andreas—a recreation of Southern California—is 95GB.</p><p> So, to save space and create a unique map for every game, developers used procedural generation. Instead of building a map piece-by-piece, procedurally generated games use an algorithm to create their worlds.</p><p> This means that even if you play the game repeatedly, the title will give you unique environments with every play-through. Furthermore, procedural generation isn’t limited to creating a game’s physical world. Developers also use it so their games will have unique dialogues, storylines, and even NPC decisions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Does-Procedural-Generation-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Procedural-Generation-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Procedural Generation Work?"></a>How Does Procedural Generation Work?</h2><p> Procedural generation starts with the algorithm and the seed. This is the basis of what you’re trying to make, and the game will use this as the template for its creation. As the<a class="link"   href="https://x-team.com/blog/procedural-generation-evolutionary-algorithms-and-possible-worlds/" >X-Team blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> puts it, the seed is “the DNA for a specific copy of whatever you’re trying to procedurally produce.”</p><p> For example, you can use the human body as the seed of your procedural generation. You can then introduce variables to your algorithm, so the final product will always look like a person but have unique features with each run.</p><p> With procedural generation, your seed ensures that you get your desired result with each run of your algorithm, while your variables give you unique results. If you pair your variable with a random number generator or RNG (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/lesson-gamers-rng/" >what is an RNG? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), you could potentially create an absurdly large or even infinite number of variations for your game.</p><h2 id="Which-Games-Use-Procedural-Generation"><a href="#Which-Games-Use-Procedural-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Which Games Use Procedural Generation?"></a>Which Games Use Procedural Generation?</h2><p> Many titles use procedural generation for their titles. In fact, this method of creating game worlds has been around since 1978, with its introduction in Beneath Apple Manor and Rogue in 1980.</p><p> So, here are a few modern titles which use this method when creating a game session.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135359/19272" target="_top" id="2135359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135359/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="No-Man’s-Sky"><a href="#No-Man’s-Sky" class="headerlink" title="No Man’s Sky"></a>No Man’s Sky</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/no-mans-sky-trailer-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="No Mans Sky trailer screenshot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: PlayStation&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLtmEjqzg7M&t=1s&ab_channel=PlayStation" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> This title is one of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-space-based-exploration-crafting-games/" >the best space exploration games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> today owing to its use of procedural generation.

So, let’s explore what a meta is and whether you should follow it.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Meta-in-Gaming"><a href="#What-Is-a-Meta-in-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Meta in Gaming?"></a>What Is a Meta in Gaming?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/esport-arena1.jpg"                      alt="A group of e-sports players in an arena."                ></p><p>OpenAI &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Designing a multiplayer game is tricky. Ideally, the game should provide players with lots of options at their disposal, giving them ways to develop their own play styles.</p><p> At the same time, the developer needs to balance each playstyle so that everyone is on an even playing field and nobody has an innate advantage.</p><p> On paper, this sounds easy; in practice, not so much. During play, players will discover that a specific playstyle, item, or tactic will give them better results. As such, to maximize their success, the players begin basing their game plan around it.</p><p> For example, imagine there’s a player-versus-player (PVP) game where players can pick between Warrior, Wizard, and Rogue. The developers will ideally want each option to be of equal power, but if the players find that the Wizard is the most powerful and the Rogue is the weakest, more people will play Wizard and fewer will play Rogue.</p><p> This shift of behavior will become the game’s “meta.” This will stay true until the Wizard is “nerfed” (decreased in power) or the Rogue is “buffed” (increased in power) to stabilize the meta.</p><p> Metas aren’t just limited to games with inherently unequal dynamics like video games with different character classes. They can affect games where both sides are on equal standing. The game of chess gives both sides the same amount of pieces, yet there is still a meta surrounding the best openers and counter-openers. And a lot of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-learning-chess-phone-ios-android/" >apps that teach people chess <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will educate players on what these meta-based moves are. Metas are found in all manner of games, even<a class="link"   href="https://gamerant.com/dungeons-dragons-5e-stop-metagaming/" >dungeon masters have to be guard against player metagaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> overpowering the fun of their Dungeons &amp; Dragons sessions.</p><p> At this point, you might be curious where the term meta came from. People sometimes claim that “meta” is an acronym, standing for “most efficient tactic available.” There’s no evidence of that, though it is a clever example of a “backronym,” where people retroactively turn a word into an acronym. Instead, the term likely stemmed from the existing word “meta,” which means something that refers to itself. This is because the meta is essentially a game based on a game, where strategies and tactics are devised before a round even starts.</p><h2 id="Are-Metas-Good-or-Bad-for-Gaming"><a href="#Are-Metas-Good-or-Bad-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Are Metas Good or Bad for Gaming?"></a>Are Metas Good or Bad for Gaming?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/woman-playing-first-person-shooter-on-gaming-pc.jpg"                      alt="woman playing first person shooter on gaming pc"                ></p><p> DC Studio&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/over-shoulder-view-african-american-gamer-2177467491" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> You can’t define metas as a strictly good or bad thing in gaming. It wholly depends on how the meta develops, and how the developers handle it after it arises.</p><p> That’s one of the fascinating things about metas. The core game can remain and persist through both good and bad meta changes. Let’s look at how a meta can help or hurt a game.</p><h3 id="How-Metas-Can-Help-Games"><a href="#How-Metas-Can-Help-Games" class="headerlink" title="How Metas Can Help Games"></a>How Metas Can Help Games</h3><p> Metas can sometimes be seen as “flavors of the month.” This is especially true for a game that receives consistent updates that tweak how the game is played. In this way, metas can help keep the game from going “stale” and introduce new play methods.</p><p> For example, the trading card game Magic the Gathering started its life as a physical card game, but it now has a digital client called “Magic the Gathering Arena” which is one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-free-pc-games/" >best free PC games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out there.</p><p> As an aside, there may be no finer example to use than Magic the Gathering on account of how its creator, game designer Richard Garfield, took the rarely used term “metagame” and injected it into the mainstream in the 1990s through his<a class="link"   href="https://edt210gamestechsociety.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2000-garfield-metagame.pdf" >conversations about game design and the “meta” strategies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> found within the Magic the Gathering game system.</p><p> Magic the Gathering has the Standard format, where new batches of cards are introduced every six months, and cards become illegal to play in Standard after two years of their release unless it’s reprinted. This allows Standard to have a “rotating meta” where there’s a flow of new cards coming in and older cards falling out of Standard. Any particularly overpowered or annoying cards are banned.</p><p> The end result is a meta that shifts every six months, which keeps Magic the Gathering from getting boring and allows players to find new combos and playstyles with the new cards. And while Magic the Gathering has had its fair share of oppressive metas, they have either been banned or drifted out of Standard. It’s a great example of how a game can shed a bad meta, introduce a good one, and keep players happy and engaged.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135416/19272" target="_top" id="2135416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135416/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-Metas-Can-Harm-Games"><a href="#How-Metas-Can-Harm-Games" class="headerlink" title="How Metas Can Harm Games"></a>How Metas Can Harm Games</h3><p> Metas are not always positive. If a meta is too “powerful,” it will warp the game around it. In severe instances, players will be at an active disadvantage if they do not, or cannot follow what the meta dictates.</p><p> To stay on the topic of trading card games, Hearthstone is one of the best<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-awesome-cross-platform-mobile-multiplayer-games/" >cross-platform mobile multiplayer games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out there. Hearthstone had a period where its meta revolved around a card called “Dr. Boom,” which had great stats and a powerful effect. And given how Hearthstone is designed, any deck could run Dr. Boom.</p><p> The card was so good that people would add it as a “must-have” no matter what archetype their deck was. And people would concede if their opponent managed to play Dr. Boom and they hadn’t drawn it yet. Deck builders had to ask themselves if their deck could handle Dr. Boom; if it couldn’t, it was a bad deck.</p><p> Eventually, Dr. Boom got a nerf and the meta re-stabilised itself, but the card was forever deemed a meta-warper by Hearthstone players.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-You-Follow-the-Meta-in-Games"><a href="#Should-You-Follow-the-Meta-in-Games" class="headerlink" title="Should You Follow the Meta in Games?"></a>Should You Follow the Meta in Games?</h2><p> Because metas aren’t strictly good or bad, it’s important to know whether or not you should follow them.</p><p> Let’s look at why you might want to follow along, why you might want to ignore the meta, and how to do so selectively.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Following-the-Game-Meta-Can-Enhance-Your-Enjoyment"><a href="#Following-the-Game-Meta-Can-Enhance-Your-Enjoyment" class="headerlink" title="Following the Game Meta Can Enhance Your Enjoyment"></a>Following the Game Meta Can Enhance Your Enjoyment</h3><p> If a meta is healthy and you enjoy playing in it, there’s nothing wrong with following it. After all, the meta developed because people found the best way to achieve something within the game.</p><p> In fact, you may enjoy following the meta and finding your own unique spin on it to fit your playstyle. Or you may even find an even better way to play. Both of which can feel very personally fulfilling.</p><p> You might be asking yourself, how can you “follow” something that is a sort of abstract game-upon-a-game layered over the existing game rules and structure you can see?</p><p> If you want to dig into the metas of the games you enjoy (or want to learn more about) a great place to start is gaming forums. Check if your game has a dedicated subreddit on reddit.com or elsewhere, like in forums on the developer’s website, Steam, or so on. Gaming blogs aren’t bad either, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find any publication as committed to the meta-analysis of a single game as that game’s subreddit.</p><p> That’s where you’ll find people actively discussing, debating, and often complaining about the meta of a given game. You’ll have plenty of reading material!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="But-Sometimes-Following-the-Meta-Kills-the-Fun"><a href="#But-Sometimes-Following-the-Meta-Kills-the-Fun" class="headerlink" title="But Sometimes Following the Meta Kills the Fun"></a>But Sometimes Following the Meta Kills the Fun</h3><p> On the flip side, some people don’t like following the meta. They instead prefer to play as they desire, regardless of if it’s the best tactic in-game.</p><p> As such, if you find a game’s meta boring and have an awful time when you play it, it’s not worth getting invested in the game.</p><p> If you want a practical approach to testing whether you should follow the meta for a game, just dive right in first. If you’re having fun, keep playing. If you feel like you could have a lot of fun but you’re just not getting some key gameplay loop or mechanic, do a little light reading on game forums or game blogs to get a feel for it.</p><p> You might learn just enough to get the basic meta without feeling overwhelmed, or you might love it and dig in to learn everything you can about the current meta of the game. A graduated approach lets you get caught up in the meta only as much as you want.</p><p> Competitive or cooperative, many games have metas, however, and it can be difficult to fully avoid them. Whether or not you follow them depends on what you want from the game, and how healthy the meta is.</p><p> So you should never feel bad stepping back from a game when you realize that the game’s meta has tricked you into a grind or play style you don’t enjoy!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dominate-search-results-powerful-youtube-seo-techniques-exposed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Dominate Search Results Powerful YouTube SEO Techniques Exposed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-instagrams-qanda-sticker-usage-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Instagram's Q&A Sticker Usage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-snapchat-to-subscribers-jake-pauls-youtube-quest/"><u>[Updated] Snapchat to Subscribers Jake Paul’s Youtube Quest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiled-top-5-visual-treats-on-social-medias-giant/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiled Top 5 Visual Treats on Social Media's Giant</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-fixing-tekken-8-launch-issues-on-windows-and-mac-systems/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to Fixing Tekken 8 Launch Issues on Windows and Mac Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-understanding-the-features-of-macxdvd-programs/"><u>Comprehensive Guide: Understanding the Features of MacXDVD Programs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blue-screen-error.techidaily.com/comprehensive-solutions-for-dealing-with-the-unusual-unexpected-store-exception-in-windows-10/"><u>Comprehensive Solutions for Dealing with the Unusual 'Unexpected Store Exception' In Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-recording-win-11s-superior-camcorders-for-2024/"><u>Cutting-Edge Recording Win 11'S Superior Camcorders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/improve-gameplay-and-accuracy-a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-steam-deck-keys/"><u>Improve Gameplay and Accuracy: A Comprehensive Guide to Using Steam Deck Keys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-additional-tips-about-sinnoh-stone-for-honor-v-purse-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Additional Tips About Sinnoh Stone For Honor V Purse | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-insiders-handbook-acquiring-high-quality-cost-free-images/"><u>In 2024, The Insider's Handbook Acquiring High-Quality, Cost-Free Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/innovative-input-devices-for-top-gamers/"><u>Innovative Input Devices for Top Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mastering-the-art-of-deleting-ps5-users/"><u>Mastering the Art of Deleting PS5 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/pinnacle-picture-quality-improving-xbox-series-x/"><u>Pinnacle Picture Quality: Improving Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/reignite-your-consoles-zest-with-these-tips/"><u>Reignite Your Console's Zest with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-non-conformists-guide-to-mastering-nycs-social-networks/"><u>The Non-Conformist’s Guide to Mastering NYC's Social Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-20-versatile-game-pairs-for-social-fun-across-devices/"><u>Top 20 Versatile Game Pairs for Social Fun Across Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/xbox-game-pass-unveiled-the-lowdown/"><u>Xbox Game Pass Unveiled: The Lowdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/xbox-revolutionizing-gaming-through-cloud-technology/"><u>Xbox: Revolutionizing Gaming Through Cloud Technology</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

With reasonable specs and a portable form factor, emulation on the Steam Deck is in a great place, but which emulators are the best?</p><p>Let’s have a look at the nine best emulators for the Steam Deck.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Dolphin"><a href="#1-Dolphin" class="headerlink" title="1. Dolphin"></a>1. Dolphin</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_dolphin_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of the dolphin emulator in the steam deck ui"                ></p><p> Emulation of the sixth and seventh console generations is a treat on the Steam Deck, with its power easily being able to comfortably run any game you can think of from this time. So, Dolphin, the Wii and GameCube emulator, is a must-have.</p><p> With minimal setup, GameCube games can be run at higher resolutions and higher frame rates. With a little elbow grease, the motion-dependent library of the Wii can be accessed with a combination of trackpad controls and gyro use. Dolphin should be one of the first stops you make with a new Steam Deck.</p><h2 id="2-Cemu"><a href="#2-Cemu" class="headerlink" title="2. Cemu"></a>2. Cemu</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_cemu_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of cemu emulator in the steam deck ui"                ></p><p> The next stop is another Nintendo console. Cemu is your answer to running Wii U games on your Steam Deck. This is also the best emulator solution to run Breath of the Wild, a popular emulation choice for the Steam Deck.</p><p> Rather than trying to emulate the much more challenging Switch, consider that some of the Switch’s biggest titles were originally on the Wii U, which makes Cemu an extremely attractive offering for performance-mindful players.</p><h2 id="3-PCSX2"><a href="#3-PCSX2" class="headerlink" title="3. PCSX2"></a>3. PCSX2</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_pcsx2_emulator_steamdeck.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of pcsx2 emulator running on steam deck"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Breaking away from the Nintendo consoles, PCSX2 is a tried and true PlayStation 2 emulator. In terms of performance, the Steam Deck has no problem meeting the demands of PS2-era games.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-the-ps2-is-the-best-console-of-all-time/" >With the PS2 considered by some to be the best console of all time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , PCSX2 will add an immense amount of value to your emulation library.</p><p> This is helped by the program generally performing better on Linux-based systems than it does on Windows, meaning that even emulation veterans will be surprised with the results here.</p><h2 id="4-PPSSPP"><a href="#4-PPSSPP" class="headerlink" title="4. PPSSPP"></a>4. PPSSPP</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_ppsspp_emulator_steamdeck.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of the ppsspp emulator runnung on steam deck"                ></p><p> The PSP was one of the first handhelds that really focused on performance and visuals. While the results might seem quaint today, the PSP has a full library of games geared towards portability. It’s a perfect match for the Steam Deck.</p><p> PPSSPP will bring this library to your Steam Deck. Just don’t be too surprised when the crunchy visuals are a bit more apparent on the Deck’s large screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134247/18498" target="_top" id="2134247">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134247" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134247/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-melonDS"><a href="#5-melonDS" class="headerlink" title="5. melonDS"></a>5. melonDS</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_melonds_emulator_steamdeck.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of melonds steam deck ui"                ></p><p> Why not add in another classic handheld while we’re at it? MelonDS aims to bring fast and accurate emulation for the original DS.</p><p> Most DS emulators struggle to comfortably present the two screens of the DS, and emulating the DS on most portable hardware provides lackluster results.</p><p> Thankfully, with the large screen of the Steam Deck, and the customizability of melonDS, you shouldn’t run into any problems laying out the screens exactly how you’d like.</p><h2 id="6-Citra"><a href="#6-Citra" class="headerlink" title="6.

You’ll have to manage where each screen is displayed, though it isn’t a problem on the Deck’s capable resolution.</p><p> This is another console with a broad library, so picking it up is a must.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135412/19272" target="_top" id="2135412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135412/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-mGBA"><a href="#7-mGBA" class="headerlink" title="7. mGBA"></a>7. mGBA</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_mgba_emulator_steamdeck_ui.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of the mgba emulator in the steam deck ui"                ></p><p> mGBA will be your answer to emulating anything from the Game Boy library. Not just the original Game Boy, but every Game Boy game up to the Game Boy Advance.</p><p> These games will look a little chunky being blown up on the Steam Deck screen, but you’ll have access to customization options to tweak to your liking. mGBA is a great addition to any growing emulation library, and feels right at home on the Steam Deck.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Ryujinx"><a href="#8-Ryujinx" class="headerlink" title="8.

The Switch is a very similar concept to the Steam Deck, so the chance to emulate Switch games should be a no-brainer.</p><p> Unfortunately, Switch emulation isn’t to the state where you can expect effortless high performance on the Deck. You can expect to play a great many games, but with differing results.</p><p> That’s why you’ll want both Ryujinx and Yuzu. Ryujinx focuses on accurate emulation, while Yuzu focuses on performance.</p><p> Between the two of these emulators, you’ll likely be able to run a huge chunk of the Switch library. Just adjust your expectations, and get acquainted with<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-optimize-steam-deck/" >common Steam Deck optimization methods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that will improve performance.</p><h2 id="9-MAME"><a href="#9-MAME" class="headerlink" title="9.

It runs great and is intuitively designed, but is naturally a lot more complicated than the previous emulators discussed.</p><p> You’ll be looking at a much longer setup time with MAME on the Steam Deck, but you’ll be gaining access to one of the largest game libraries yet.</p><p> Control configuration is going to be one of the biggest issues with MAME on the Deck. Thankfully, the Deck boasts an impressive amount of configurable buttons and touchpads. If there’s a will, there will be a way.</p><h2 id="Get-EmuDeck"><a href="#Get-EmuDeck" class="headerlink" title="Get EmuDeck"></a>Get EmuDeck</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_emulators_listed_in_steamdeck_ui.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of emulators listed in steam deck ui"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> With all of the above emulators in mind, we have access to a decent chunk of gaming history. Keep in mind that you’ll want to get the Linux versions of these emulators, unless you’ve installed Windows onto your Steam Deck.</p><p> You’ll also need to navigate Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode to configure a lot of these emulators to your preference. While this is a valid method and a chance to try some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-use-steam-deck-desktop-mode-without-dock/" >tips to use the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode without a dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , EmuDeck makes the process a lot easier.</p><p> EmuDeck turns the process of setting up dozens of emulators into an almost-one-click process. Every emulator mentioned in this list is available on EmuDeck.</p><p> It’s highly recommended you consider EmuDeck if you’re looking to easily set these emulators up. For users who aren’t very familiar with Desktop Mode, it’s almost a must.</p><p> Another reason EmuDeck is important is its ability to convert ROMs directly into gaming mode-compatible shortcuts.

While the graphics are super simple, the gameplay can prove rather challenging.</p><p> The goal is to get the numbered ball to the larger circle within a certain number of bounces. This limited number shows on the smaller circle. Once you use the last bounce, the ball explodes if it hasn’t reached its destination.</p><p> While some stages are complex, the game lacks timers and other restrictions. So you can play at your own pace. To restart a level, just tap twice on the screen. With 99 levels, ULTRAFLOW’s bound to keep you busy for a while.</p><p> And if that’s not enough, there’s also ULTRAFLOW 2, with an extra 180 levels available completely for free.

While it might miss the chiptunes you grew up with; the original EDM soundtrack is still pretty pleasant.</p><p> The goal is to race to the finish line in various objective-based missions assigned by the “Mother” computer system. What sets DATA WING apart from other racers is the unique driving system. Your ship flies automatically, and you tap left or right to steer towards either direction.</p><p> To apply brakes, simply tap both sides at the same time. You can also thrust off walls, using the momentum to your advantage to pass other racers.</p><p> Though DATA WING is about racing, it does have a story spanning two hours with 40 levels to complete. Ultimately, this is a fun, story-driven, competitive racing game that gets your blood pumping.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> DATA WING for<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DanVogt.DATAWING" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1206723870" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-OHM-A-Virtual-Science-Centre"><a href="#5-OHM-A-Virtual-Science-Centre" class="headerlink" title="5.

The graphics are beautiful and pull you into the fascinating world of energy and electricity.</p><p> In OHM, you’ll learn about energy and how it works. It explains how energy becomes electricity from an atomic level, working its way up to more significant objects, like transportation. The game comprises several puzzle-based chapters featuring different topics that it explains in a fun and interactive way.</p><p> OHM’s puzzles are mostly straightforward, but that’s what you’d expect from a game that’s supposed to serve an educational purpose. But as the learning progresses, the puzzles get trickier. It never gets too complicated, though, making the game perfect for children.</p><p> After all, who said you couldn’t have fun and learn something simultaneously?

PewPew"></a>6. PewPew</h2><p> Love Geometry Wars but don’t feel like paying a premium? PewPew lets you experience multidirectional shoot-em-up action at no cost.</p><p> The graphics in PewPew are basic, but it’s perfect if you crave bright neon shape outlines against a black background. PewPew has a high frame rate and features five different game modes: Pandemonium, Dodge This, Assault, Chromatic Conflict, and Asteroids.</p><p> Pandemonium includes enemies that explode or spin maniacally upon death, causing chaos for you. Dodge This challenges you to collect boxes while avoiding enemies. Assault is like classic Geometry Wars, where you fight waves of enemies.</p><p> Chromatic Conflict involves killing only enemies that match your ship’s current color, which gets a bit tricky and requires observation and patience. Finally, Asteroids is like the classic game of the same name that you’ve probably played before.</p><p> As if these game modes aren’t enough, PewPew also has playable ships to unlock and leaderboards to climb. It’s incredible how this game is free with no strings attached.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> PewPew on<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jyaif.pewpew" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/pewpew/id314964252" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="7-Underhand"><a href="#7-Underhand" class="headerlink" title="7. Underhand"></a>7. Underhand</h2><p> Want something completely free but also unique? Then check out Underhand by Spoopy Squad—there’s nothing else like it.</p><p> Underhand bills itself as a CCG, which usually stands for “collectible card game,” but here stands for “cultist card game.” That means you take on the role of a cult leader and must manage your cult’s resources effectively.</p><p> Meanwhile, you must respond to various event cards drawn from the deck. Your response to events determines the success of your cult and how far it will go.</p><p> Your cult’s primary goal is to summon an “Ancient One,” but again, this depends on your resource management and success. Otherwise, the cult may fall prey to the trials and tribulations of time itself. Either way, Underhand provides a thrilling choice-based adventure that anyone can enjoy.</p><p> We recommend you carefully go through the tutorial initially because otherwise, you’ll likely end up getting lost. However, once you start playing, it’s hard to stop.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Underhand by Spoopy Squad for<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU36314/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free)</p><h2 id="8-Simon-Tatham’s-Puzzles"><a href="#8-Simon-Tatham’s-Puzzles" class="headerlink" title="8.

Now, with just a few taps on your smartphone, you can compete against opponents worldwide and hone your skills in single-player matches in your favorite mobile sports games.</p><p> Below, we’ve created a list of the best sports games for mobile users, each offering unique features that have earned them a spot on our list. We’ve included a game from every popular sport on this list, so no matter which sports your passion lies in, you’re likely to find a game that caters to your interests.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Table-Tennis-Touch"><a href="#1-Table-Tennis-Touch" class="headerlink" title="1.

The game boasts four engaging modes: Career, Quick Game, and Arcade.</p><p> The Quick Game mode can be played against AI-controlled opponents from various countries. All you have to do to play is hit the ball across the table by swiping your racket. You’re awarded a point if your opponent misses the ball, and you lose a point to your opponent if you miss the ball instead.</p><p> One thing disappointing about the game is that you cannot play against real opponents. Although a multiplayer mode is provided, accessing it requires downloading a separate multiplayer version of Table Tennis Touch called Ping Pong Fury.</p><p> Ping Pong Fury, although popular, lacks many of the features present in Table Tennis Touch, such as offline gameplay and career and arcade modes. The game’s developers should consider integrating a multiplayer mode within Table Tennis Touch itself.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Table Tennis Touch for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/table-tennis-touch/id860620713" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.yakuto.TableTennisTouch" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Tennis-Clash"><a href="#2-Tennis-Clash" class="headerlink" title="2.

The gameplay mechanics are easy to master—all you have to do is position where you want to hit the ball and swipe on the screen to deliver a hit. You earn a point when your opponent fails to return the ball and concede a point if you miss the ball yourself.</p><p> In Tennis Clash, you can play offline matches against an AI opponent or with real players worldwide in iconic locations such as New York, Sydney, Rio, Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, and more. Additionally, you can join or create clubs and play in exciting events.</p><p> One thing that the developers of Tennis Clash could work on is the match-making ability of the game. Several players have complained about being matched to opponents with a far higher skill level. The in-game purchases to level up your player are also a bit costly.</p><p> Aside from these drawbacks, we’d say the game offers the best realistic tennis action we’ve seen in any other tennis game so far.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Tennis Clash for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tennis-clash-sports-stars-game/id1346179411" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfgco.games.sports.free.tennis.clash" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="3-Real-Cricket-22"><a href="#3-Real-Cricket-22" class="headerlink" title="3.

The game is about building your ultimate dream team and dominating the football pitch. You can swap and compare different players, form different lineups and formations, and unlock the powerful abilities of players in your team by training them and getting skill boosts.</p><p> The gameplay is smooth with manual controls, allowing you to pass, tackle, shoot goals, and more with precision and skill. FIFA Soccer truly captures the essence of the game with its stunning graphics and lifelike animations that bring every football match to life on your mobile screen.</p><p> The only thing that we thought could be improved was the interface. Currently, the game features are spread out, and it can be challenging to familiarize oneself with all the functionalities. A more organized home page with all game features neatly placed under relevant sections or categories would greatly benefit players.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> FIFA Soccer for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fifa-soccer/id1094930513" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.fifamobile" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-NBA-2K-Mobile-Basketball-Game"><a href="#5-NBA-2K-Mobile-Basketball-Game" class="headerlink" title="5.

Once you are in a favorable position near the goal, you can aim and shoot to attempt to score a goal.</p><p> However, the game bots in Hockey All Stars do not pose a significant challenge and lack basic defensive and offensive skills, making it too easy to score goals against them.

Even if you look up lists of free games on Steam online, there’s a chance they won’t be up-to-date and miss some of the newer releases. Fortunately, you can take matters into your own hands with these handy ways I use to find great free games.</p><h2 id="1-Finding-the-Best-Free-Steam-Games-With-Steam-Search"><a href="#1-Finding-the-Best-Free-Steam-Games-With-Steam-Search" class="headerlink" title="1 Finding the Best Free Steam Games With Steam Search"></a>1 Finding the Best Free Steam Games With Steam Search</h2><p> There are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/all-gamers-should-use-steam-reasons-why/" >reasons to use Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but one thing I really like about it is how easy it is to find well-rated free games. To do this, go to the Steam store front page (it doesn’t matter if it’s in the client or on the website). Then, click the<strong>magnifying glass</strong> icon to the right of the search box to bring up the search tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-magnifying.png"                      alt="Clicking the magnifying glass on Steam"                ></p><p> Look at the filters on the right side of the results. At the very top, you should see<strong>Narrow by price</strong> . Drag the slider all the way to the left so that the filter reads<strong>Free</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-slider.png"                      alt="Adjusting the price slider on Steam"                ></p><p> Now you have every free product on Steam at your fingertips. This will include products you likely won’t have any use for, such as free DLC for games you don’t own. To fix that, go down to the<strong>Show selected types</strong> filter and check<strong>Games</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/good-free-games-steam-types.png"                      alt="Selecting the Games filter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959759/19272" target="_top" id="1959759">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959759" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959759/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you want, you can also take the time to go through the filters and refine what games you see. For example, you can select relevant tags, how many players the game supports, or whether or not it has been verified for the Steam Deck. If you’re taking the latter route, remember that you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-pc-mouse-and-keyboard-with-steam-deck-using-barrier/" >share your mouse and keyboard with your Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you think it’ll help with a particular genre.</p><p> Finally, we want to see what the best games are. To do this, click on the drop-down box next to<strong>Sort by</strong> and click<strong>User reviews</strong> .

The same few games stay at the top of the rankings, and if you play them all, you’re pretty much stuck until another blockbuster game comes out.</p><p> Fortunately, there is a way to find good, free games that have just been released.

If you want to go this route, you’ll need to take advantage of some third-party websites.</p><p> Reddit has a few subreddits dedicated to finding free games, including titles that are having a free promotion period. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/" >FreeGameFinder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGamesOnSteam/" >FreeGamesOnSteam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> subreddits are good places to check out; the latter is particularly good at weeding out games that are only free for a weekend, or during a beta test.</p><p> You can also check out<a class="link"   href="https://steamdb.info/upcoming/free/" >SteamDB’s free promotions filter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more titles. This will include DLC titles, but if a game is having a 100% off sale, it’ll pop up here for you to check out.</p><p> And finally, if you’re looking for an older game, there’s always a chance that you can get it for free elsewhere. Check out these<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-sites-where-you-can-download-old-pc-games-for-free-nb/" >sites where you can download old games for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><p> Finding free Steam games is easy, but finding titles worthy of your time is a little trickier.

Helldivers 2, a game by Arrowhead Game Studios, exploded in popularity on PC and PS5 consoles in 2024. How can a future multiplayer game replicate Arrowhead’s success? Here are some key things I’ve noticed as a player that contribute to the game’s success.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123748/7443" target="_top" id="2123748">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123748" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123748/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play"><a href="#1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play" class="headerlink" title="1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play"></a>1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0416461.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Super Earth public service announcement"                ></p><p> Helldivers 2 is a third-person shooter live service game where players become Helldivers fighting for Super Earth. Players join teammates in missions on different planets across the universe to eradicate Terminids (bug-like alien life forms) and Automatons (robots). Helldivers harvest valuable resources from planets that are home to Terminids and Automatons.</p><p> Gamers can play Helldivers 2 on the PlayStation 5 and PC. One of the keys to a successful multiplayer game is ensuring that even if your friend has a PC, but you only have a PlayStation, you’ll still be able to join each other in the interplanetary fight for democracy in Helldivers 2.</p><p> Cross-platform multiplayer features allow people to play games with friends who may use different platforms and maintain social connections while increasing the overall player pool. It’s one of the reasons<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/platform-exclusive-games-thing-of-the-past-good/" >platform-exclusive games are becoming a thing of the past <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="2-Listen-to-Community-Members"><a href="#2-Listen-to-Community-Members" class="headerlink" title="2 Listen to Community Members"></a>2 Listen to Community Members</h2><p> Months after launch, Sony announced that PC players would have to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to their Steam account to continue playing Helldivers 2 with multiplayer functionality. This created an uproar across the Helldivers 2 player base, which caused Sony to backtrack on its decision only two days later.</p><p> This outcry resulted in more than 150,000 negative reviews on the<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS%5F2/#app%5Freviews%5Fhash" >Helldivers 2 Steam page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (with some reviews reversed after the policy change). Despite Sony backtracking on this decision, Helldivers 2 is still currently delisted in countries that do not have access to PSN accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415451.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Warbond menu"                ></p><p> The game was faced with alienating a large portion of its player base, but its willingness to reverse its decision got it back on track.</p><h2 id="3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence"><a href="#3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence" class="headerlink" title="3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence"></a>3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence</h2><p> The Helldivers 2 social media pages post frequent game updates, challenges, and memes that earn impressive engagement. For instance, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/helldivers2game/?hl=en" >Helldivers 2 Instagram page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> boasts over 100,000 followers.</p><p> Helldivers 2 also has a<a class="link"   href="https://discord.com/invite/zbbZ5rNcuK" >Discord server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with almost 1 million members, where players receive updates from the game’s developers.

One recent Major Order required the game’s player base to kill 2 million Terminids to receive in-game currency called medals.</p><p> The game’s developers put out new Major Orders every week to engage the community. The community is not guaranteed to pass each Major Order, making it a challenge for the entire player base. Each mission in Helldivers 2 that a player participates in adds to the progress of the Major Order, making the success of the mission entirely based on community progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System"><a href="#5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System" class="headerlink" title="5 Have a Free Progression System"></a>5 Have a Free Progression System</h2><p> There are multiple forms of in-game currency in Helldivers 2 which players can find in missions for free. If a player is looking to fast-track unlocking items available in Warbonds (battle passes), weapons, and other cosmetics, there are paid options, as well. Importantly, a player does not have to pay to advance in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415430.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Acquisition Center"                ></p><p> Players can find Super Credits, which unlock new monthly Warbonds and cosmetics, across missions at random points on the map. Super Credits are also available for purchase in the game store. Medals can be obtained by completing Major Orders or finding stashes during missions. You can also earn medals by completing missions.

The worst offender is when games encourage you to spend more money, even after you’ve paid retail prices. This form of monetization is labeled as being pay-to-win if the game pushes you to buy unfair advantages over other players.</p><p> However, while lots of live service games are pay-to-win, some manage to avoid predatory monetization and end up being great all-around experiences. So, if you want to experience one of the most common gaming trends, here are the best examples that won’t force you to pay extra.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Fortnite"><a href="#1-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="1. Fortnite"></a>1. Fortnite</h2><p> The undisputed king of live service games, especially when it comes to popularity, is Fortnite. And surprisingly, if you want to avoid pay-to-win practices in live service games, Fortnite is also an apt example.</p><p> Many aspects define<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/live-service-games-what-how-work/" >how live service games work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and often games that switch to live service will also become free-to-play, just like Halo Infinite Multiplayer. However, with this switch to free-to-play gaming, you will often find a trade-off in which the game will feature more monetization.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d83a12dd-db8b-4005-b944-e799c4792980.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of a Fortnite Victory Royale on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But Fortnite provides a free-to-play live service experience that never forces you to purchase microtransactions. All the microtransactions in Fortnite are entirely cosmetic, and even if you buy level skips, all unlockables remain cosmetic.</p><p> The result is an experience where you can spend money on some of Fortnite’s endless themed events, like Transformers-themed skins, but are never forced to do so. Bundle this with how Fortnite constantly evolves to provide a fresh experience, and live service gaming’s most popular title turns out to be one of its best.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Fortnite on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/fortnite/" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/fortnite/bt5p2x999vh2" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fortnite-switch/" >Nintendo Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or<a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fortnite" >Epic Games Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Sea-of-Thieves"><a href="#2-Sea-of-Thieves" class="headerlink" title="2. Sea of Thieves"></a>2. Sea of Thieves</h2><p> Aside from battle royale live service games like Fortnite, the Xbox-exclusive title Sea of Thieves provides a unique game focused on swash-buckling piracy, exploration, and ship-to-ship combat. More importantly, the in-game activities for Sea of Thieves allow for enough rewards to keep you from spending extra money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sea-of-thieves-loading.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Sea of Thieves on Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The gameplay loop in Sea of Thieves and its reward system is much like many other live service titles or MMOs. Throughout the game, you can complete specific bounties for Guilds, progressing toward your next Guild level and earning Gold. The higher your Guild level, the more rewards you can unlock or purchase.</p><p> Generally, because of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-pay-to-win-in-video-games/" >how pay-to-win games work <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , aspects of your game are restricted to encourage you to spend money to compensate. For instance, the Guild system can become highly tedious if progression moves at a snail’s pace or rewards are locked behind a paywall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sea-of-thieves-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of gameplay from Sea of Thieves on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But in Sea of Thieves, you may never feel the need to spend money as the quest rewards in terms of XP and currency, whether through finding a Treasure Chest or fighting a Skeleton Ship, are enough to purchase the unlocks you receive throughout the game.</p><p> And yes, while you can spend money on cosmetic store items to deck out your ship in whatever ridiculous theme may be available at the time, the unlocks from Guilds and free events all feel worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Sea of Thieves 2023 Edition on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sea-of-thieves-2023-edition/9P2N57MC619K/0010" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea%5Fof%5FThieves%5F2023%5FEdition/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-League-of-Legends"><a href="#3-League-of-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. League of Legends"></a>3. League of Legends</h2><p> Many online battle arena games focus on providing a free-to-play live service experience for you to sink countless hours into. But when it comes to PC gaming, League of Legends represents one of the best anti-pay-to-win titles you can play.</p><p> Like other games of its genre, League of Legends focuses on a roster of fantastical Champions and pits you against numerous online opponents in arena-based combat. This involves fine-tuning your Champion’s build, items, and abilities throughout every match.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/league-of-legends-promotional-image.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image for League of Legends"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" >League of Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> And in a game that relies so heavily on optimizing builds, any pay-to-win aspects would potentially break the entire gameplay loop of League of Legends. And luckily, the developers are on the same page, with Riot promising to only ever feature cosmetic microtransactions.</p><p> However, unlocking Champions, while available through free-to-earn currency, can be slow, and you are given the option to purchase a Champion through paid currency. But even in this case, League of Legends provides you with 15 free Champions to play on rotation every week.</p><p> So while you may feel the urge to buy a Champion with paid money, you can always experience other free League of Legends Champions, and earn currency towards a Champion you are tempted to buy along the way.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : League of Legends via the official<a class="link"   href="https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/index" >League of Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> site.</p><h2 id="4-Rocket-League"><a href="#4-Rocket-League" class="headerlink" title="4. Rocket League"></a>4. Rocket League</h2><p> Sometimes, pay-to-win mechanics can appear in more mysterious ways, presenting you with unfair advantages and disadvantages where you least expect them. These mechanics can extend to the damage you deal, your ability cooldowns, or even in-game hitboxes.</p><p> For Rocket League, the free-to-play live service soccer game with cars, having a more advantageous hitbox to connect with the ball would be a massive bias. Luckily, not only is the game free-to-play, but it also features no way you can pay for advantages over other players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/rocket-league-octane-body.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of Rocket League on Xbox Series X showcasing the car customization options"                ></p><p> And while there are different hitboxes for different cars, the default cars available at the start of the game represent some of the best hitboxes anyway. If you use the Octane body, you already have the best hitbox, and it’s completely free.</p><p> Combined with the unique merging of soccer and Hot Wheels-like racing, Rocket League becomes an addictive game that you and your friends can dive into without the fear of intrusive pay-to-win practices.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Rocket League on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rocket-league/C125W9BG2K0V/0001" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2002-CUSA01163%5F00-ROCKETLEAGUENA01" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/rocket-league-switch/" >Nintendo Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or the<a class="link"   href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rocket-league" >Epic Games Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Smite"><a href="#5-Smite" class="headerlink" title="5. Smite"></a>5. Smite</h2><p> Another key factor of live service games, especially if you go to play a free-to-play live service game, is Battle Passes. And games that feature a Battle Pass come with an extra layer to how pay-to-win practices can be implemented.</p><p> For instance, if you play a live service title with a premium paid Battle Pass that keeps exclusive features like weapons or stat boosts locked behind a pay wall, the game is likely pay-to-win.</p><p> But while there are many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/video-games-battle-pass-can-alter-gaming-experience/" >ways Battle Passes can alter your gaming experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , if you want to experience a free-to-play live service title that represents a well-implemented Battle Pass with no pay-to-win features, Smite is the game for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/smite-loading.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the loading screen for Smite on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> Smite is a free-to-play online battle arena game like League of Legends that takes a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective instead of top-down.</p><p> Uniquely, Smite enables you to play and fight against Gods from almost every pantheon without fear of being forced to spend money.

But once you dive deeper into the game, you’ll realize that the level of gameplay, gear, and character optimization provided far outstretches Diablo IV.</p><p> With an immensely vast paragon tree and a unique feature in which the combination of gems placed in your armor influences your skills and allows for skill customization, Path of Exile stands on its own as a rival, not an alternative, to Diablo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/path-of-exile-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of gameplay for Path of Exile on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> And even with the main story completed, you can still expect to sink countless hours into the post-game activities, just as you would Diablo. Better yet, while the game features a paid Battle Pass, none of the unlockables affect gameplay and are all cosmetic.</p><p> This makes Path of Exile a must-play for any action-RPG fans, and a breath of fresh air if you’re looking for a live service title jam-packed full of content and free from any pay-to-win intrusions.</p><p><strong>Download</strong> : Path of Exile on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/path-of-exile/bwc95bzpfbs7" >Microsoft Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ,<a class="link"   href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4781-CUSA11924%5F00-GGGPS4GAMEFULL01" >PS Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path%5Fof%5FExile/" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Live-Service-Games-Can-Be-Free-From-Predatory-Microtransactions"><a href="#Live-Service-Games-Can-Be-Free-From-Predatory-Microtransactions" class="headerlink" title="Live Service Games Can Be Free From Predatory Microtransactions"></a>Live Service Games Can Be Free From Predatory Microtransactions</h2><p> While tons of live service games feature intrusive microtransactions and, yes, pay-to-win practices, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to find fair and fun live service titles among the rabble.</p><p> And if you’re willing to push through the barrage of live service announcements and games, you can find free-to-play titles like Fortnite and Path of Exile that represent hundreds of hours of gameplay.

Let’s take a look.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Check-the-Friends-Community-App-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S"><a href="#1-Check-the-Friends-Community-App-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S" class="headerlink" title="1. Check the Friends &amp; Community App on Your Xbox Series X|S"></a>1. Check the Friends &amp; Community App on Your Xbox Series X|S</h2><p> On Xbox, one of the main ways you can track online behavior is through the<strong>Friends &amp; Community Updates</strong> app. From here, you can view any game captures, achievements, or posts from your friends. And the best part? Even posts from friends appearing offline are shown through the app.</p><p> If one of your friends has a post on the<strong>Friends &amp; Community Updates</strong> app but has been offline for a while, they are more than likely appearing offline. To check the<strong>Friends &amp; Community Updates</strong> app for friends appearing offline, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>From the home screen of your Xbox, select<strong>My games &amp; apps</strong> .</li><li>Highlight the option for<strong>Apps</strong> , and select<strong>Friends &amp; Community Updates</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screenshot-2995.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Apps section of My Games and Apps on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><ul><li>Find the displayed posts under<strong>Shared by friends</strong> .</li><li>Scroll through the listed posts, looking for one of your offline friends.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3157.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the main menu of the Friends and Community Updates app on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> If you find a recent post by an offline friend, you know they are appearing offline. And through the type of posts you find, you can see the games, achievements, or captures your friend has posted.</p><h2 id="2-View-the-Xbox-Series-X-S-Gamerscore-Leaderboard"><a href="#2-View-the-Xbox-Series-X-S-Gamerscore-Leaderboard" class="headerlink" title="2. View the Xbox Series X|S Gamerscore Leaderboard"></a>2. View the Xbox Series X|S Gamerscore Leaderboard</h2><p> Aside from searching through Xbox posts, a quicker way of telling if someone has been appearing offline involves viewing the monthly<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> on your Xbox Series X|S.</p><p> The<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> is a monthly tracker of all of you and your friend’s earned Gamerscore for the month. And, much like the<strong>Friends &amp; Community Updates</strong> app, it also tracks the earned Gamerscore of offline friends.</p><p> So, you can use the<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> to tell if offline friends are still unlocking achievements, and by association, appearing offline. To do this, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the<strong>Xbox button</strong> to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X|S.</li><li>Navigate to the options for<strong>People</strong> , and select<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3160-1.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Gamerscore Leaderboard on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129739/7443" target="_top" id="2129739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Look through the rankings of you and your friends, looking for an offline friend who has been consistently earning Gamerscore.</li></ul><p> If you know someone hasn’t been online for the duration of the time the<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> has been tracking Achievements, but you can see they have earned Gamerscore, they are appearing offline.</p><h2 id="3-Look-Through-Your-Xbox-Friend’s-Achievements"><a href="#3-Look-Through-Your-Xbox-Friend’s-Achievements" class="headerlink" title="3. Look Through Your Xbox Friend’s Achievements"></a>3. Look Through Your Xbox Friend’s Achievements</h2><p> While the past few methods help you to tell if someone is appearing offline for a long period, there are more direct ways to tell if people are offline on Xbox.</p><p> Instead of viewing the trends of the<strong>Gamerscore leaderboard</strong> , if you have a friend in mind, you can specifically look at recently unlocked Achievements. This way, you can see on the day if a friend has been earning Gamerscore. To analyze a specific friend’s Achievements, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the<strong>Xbox button</strong> to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X|S.</li><li>Highlight<strong>People</strong> , and select<strong>Friends</strong> .</li><li>Find and select the friend you want to check and choose<strong>See full profile</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3163.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of an Xbox Friend profile on Xbox Series X with the option See Full Profile highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Under<strong>Social</strong> , highlight<strong>Activity Feed</strong> to see recently unlocked Achievements.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3173.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of an Xbox Friend Activity Feed on Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880976/19272" target="_top" id="1880976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880976/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> From here, you should be able to see your friend’s most recently unlocked Achievement and how long ago it was unlocked. You know your friend is appearing offline if they are offline but have unlocked Achievements recently.</p><p> Alternatively, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-compare-gaming-stats-with-friends/" >compare gaming statistics with a friend on your Xbox Series X|S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to provide direct Achievement comparisons with the games you have been playing.</p><h2 id="4-Use-the-Time-Played-Feature-for-Specific-Xbox-Games"><a href="#4-Use-the-Time-Played-Feature-for-Specific-Xbox-Games" class="headerlink" title="4. Use the Time Played Feature for Specific Xbox Games"></a>4. Use the Time Played Feature for Specific Xbox Games</h2><p> A final way you can tell if one of your Xbox friends is appearing offline is by checking a friend’s<strong>Time played</strong> statistic in a specific Xbox game.</p><p> Because Xbox allows you to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-check-time-played-on-xbox-series-xs/" >check the time played for any Xbox Series X|S game <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , if you have a game you know the offline person has been playing, you can tell in real-time if they are playing a game despite being offline. To do this, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the<strong>Xbox button</strong> to open the Guide menu on your Xbox.</li><li>Highlight the options for<strong>People</strong> and select<strong>Friends</strong> .</li><li>Select your friend’s Profile.</li><li>Highlight<strong>Gaming</strong> , and select a game.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3169.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Gaming option available on Xbox Series X when comparing two Xbox Profiles"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151860/7443" target="_top" id="2151860">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151860" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151860/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Scroll down the on-screen gaming stats until you find<strong>Time played</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3166.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Time Played statistic on an Xbox Series X for a specific Xbox game"                ></p><p> With stats for<strong>Time played</strong> on-screen, you can check how much time the friend has put into the selected game. If you suspect them of being offline, you can check the<strong>Time played</strong> stat again to see if they have put more time into the game while seemingly offline.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Keep-Track-of-Your-Friends-on-Xbox-Series-X-S-for-Smooth-Social-Gaming"><a href="#Keep-Track-of-Your-Friends-on-Xbox-Series-X-S-for-Smooth-Social-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Keep Track of Your Friends on Xbox Series X|S for Smooth Social Gaming"></a>Keep Track of Your Friends on Xbox Series X|S for Smooth Social Gaming</h2><p> When an Xbox friend appears offline, whether it is to ignore you, not play a specific game, or even to just escape social pressures, it can complicate organizing social gaming sessions. But at least with Xbox Series X|S, you can use any of the above methods to try and get to the bottom of why or if a friend is offline.</p><p> With the questions of whether and why someone is offline solved, you can get on with organizing your Xbox parties and sessions without any extra social road bumps caused by offline players.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-crafting-professional-broadcasts-mastering-obs-plus-zoom-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Crafting Professional Broadcasts Mastering OBS + Zoom Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-basketball-enthusiasts-guide-to-online-viewing/"><u>2024 Approved Basketball Enthusiast's Guide to Online Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elite-arena-showdown-best-of-the-royales/"><u>2024 Approved Elite Arena Showdown Best of the Royales</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionizing-podcast-titles-leading-10-ai-generators/"><u>2024 Approved Revolutionizing Podcast Titles Leading 10 AI Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-monetary-journey-of-ajey-nagar-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved The Monetary Journey of Ajey Nagar on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/mp3-wmv-movavi/"><u>在線 MP3 改成 WMV - 使用 Movavi 電子郵件免費提高效率</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/1715701074716-eco-friendly-recorder-ads-absolved/"><u>Eco-Friendly Recorder - Ads Absolved!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gaming-service-stack-up-xbox-game-pass-versus-psplus-ultimate/"><u>Gaming Service Stack-Up: Xbox Game Pass Versus PS+ Ultimate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/nvidias-gaming-giants-clash-4070-super-vs-titan-x-4080/"><u>Nvidia's Gaming Giants Clash: 4070 Super Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Pure-PlayStation-Cleaning-Without-Risk"><a href="#Pure-PlayStation-Cleaning-Without-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Pure PlayStation: Cleaning Without Risk"></a>Pure PlayStation: Cleaning Without Risk</h2><p> Unfortunate as it might be, cleaning is a necessary part of life, and your PS5 is not exempt from this rule. Making sure that your PS5 console and controllers are clean and free of dust or debris is a vital part of caring for your system.</p><p> If you are anxious about opening up your PS5 to clean it, don’t be. You can perform adequate maintenance on your system without having to completely take it apart.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-Often-Do-I-Have-to-Clean-My-PS5"><a href="#How-Often-Do-I-Have-to-Clean-My-PS5" class="headerlink" title="How Often Do I Have to Clean My PS5?"></a>How Often Do I Have to Clean My PS5?</h2><p> No matter how clean you are or how often you wash your hands, dust and dirt are unavoidable. As well as being generally annoying, dust can also pose a dangerous risk to electronics when left unchecked.</p><p> Dust can get inside your PS5 console and become lodged in the fan. Over time, this dust can affect the fan’s ability to properly cool your system, causing your console to overheat. To prevent this, it’s recommended that you clean your console every couple of months.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PS5-and-dualsense-in-brightly-lit-room-.jpg"                      alt="PS5 and DualSense in brightly lit room"                ></p><p> When it comes to your PS5 controller, it is a great idea to clean it weekly or even after each use. Even if you wash your hands before each gaming session, they still release natural oils and sweat which collect on the controller and make it dirty.</p><p> Dust also poses a risk to your PS5 DualSense controller. Since your controller sits facing upward, it can fall between the buttons or collect around your joystick. Over time, this can cause your controller to drift.</p><h2 id="What-Are-Some-of-the-Symptoms-of-a-Dirty-PS5"><a href="#What-Are-Some-of-the-Symptoms-of-a-Dirty-PS5" class="headerlink" title="What Are Some of the Symptoms of a Dirty PS5?"></a>What Are Some of the Symptoms of a Dirty PS5?</h2><p> If you aren’t servicing your console or controller at regular intervals, there is more chance of your device exhibiting some of the classic symptoms of dust buildup that let you know when it’s time for a clean. If you experience any of the below issues, a cleaning is definitely in order.</p><ul><li>Your fan becomes much louder than usual.</li><li>You experience graphical issues such as artifacting.</li><li>Your console turns off due to overheating.</li><li>Your controller starts drifting.</li></ul><p> Dust is one of the main causes of heat buildup, and giving it a good clean is the first thing you should do if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-ps5-overheating/" >stop your PS5 from overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Products-Do-I-Need-to-Clean-My-PS5"><a href="#What-Products-Do-I-Need-to-Clean-My-PS5" class="headerlink" title="What Products Do I Need to Clean My PS5?"></a>What Products Do I Need to Clean My PS5?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-clean-ps5-console-safely-.jpg"                      alt="How to clean ps5 console safely"                ></p><p> Cleaning your PS5 console and controller is simple and doesn’t require expensive equipment. The best products to use to clean your system are as follows:</p><ul><li>A terrycloth or microfiber cloth.</li><li>Isopropyl alcohol.</li><li>Q-tips.</li><li>A low-powered vacuum.</li><li>Compressed air.</li></ul><p> When cleaning your PS5 it is important to only use the recommended products. Substituting any of the above products for others that you already have on hand can cause more harm than good to your console.</p><p> Liquids like soapy water can seep inside the console and damage electrical components. Isopropyl alcohol has an evaporative nature which makes it safer to use on your PS5. Since it dissipates quickly, it reduces the risk of damage to any electrical parts.</p><p> Similarly, it is important not to substitute a low-powered vacuum for a household vacuum cleaner to suck dust and debris from your PS5 console or controller. Household vacuum cleaners are too powerful and also generate a lot of static electricity, which has the potential to seriously damage your console.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Safely-Clean-My-PS5"><a href="#How-Do-I-Safely-Clean-My-PS5" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Safely Clean My PS5?"></a>How Do I Safely Clean My PS5?</h2><p> Thankfully, both the PS5 console and DualSense controller can be easily cleaned without having to be fully dismantled. As long as you are using the correct methods and products, not much can go wrong. To learn how to safely clean both your PS5 console and DualSense controller, see the instructions below.</p><h3 id="Cleaning-Your-PS5-Console"><a href="#Cleaning-Your-PS5-Console" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning Your PS5 Console"></a>Cleaning Your PS5 Console</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/241E8BA0-13CF-411F-A96A-2055E42D1869.jpeg"                      alt="How to safely clean your PS5 console before and after"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The only thing you will have to remove from your PS5 console to clean it is the covers. These covers are intentionally easy to remove for cleaning and even customization purposes. Here’s how:</p><p>1. Turn your PS5 off and remove all wires connected to the console.</p><p>2. Remove the base by gently sliding it off.</p><p>3. Place the PS5 on a flat surface.</p><p> 4. Position the console so the PS logo faces up, and the power button is away from you.</p><p> 5. Place your thumb on the PS logo and simultaneously pull up and to the right until the cover releases. You will hear a click when the cover is free. The covers are very secure, so removing them requires a decent amount of pressure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-replace-ps5-cover-top-side-2.jpg"                      alt="How to replace ps5 cover top side 2"                ></p><p> Once you’ve removed the top cover, you will notice two holes in the body of your PS5. These are designed to catch dust. If there is a lot of dust in these reservoirs, use your low-powered vacuum, compressed air can, or cloth to remove it. You may also notice some dust in and around the fan. Gently wipe or blow this away before putting the cover back on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-clean-ps5-console-dust-resevoirs.jpg"                      alt="How to clean ps5 console dust resevoirs"                ></p><p> If you were planning on customizing your PS5, this is the point in the process where you would do so.

You don’t need to add any pressure or push down here. The cover should simply slide and click into place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-to-replace-ps5-cover-bottom-side.jpg"                      alt="How to replace ps5 cover bottom side"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Flip your PS5 onto the opposite side, positioning it so the PS logo faces down and the power button faces towards you. Grip the top left corner of the cover, and pull up and to the right until it slides out of place. Follow the same methods to clean any dust or debris out of your console before reapplying the cover.</p><h3 id="Cleaning-Your-PS5-DualSense-Controller"><a href="#Cleaning-Your-PS5-DualSense-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning Your PS5 DualSense Controller"></a>Cleaning Your PS5 DualSense Controller</h3><p> The DualSense controller is even easier to clean, and you can do so without removing any parts at all. Since the back of the controller is textured, it grabs hold of dirt and grime very easily. To clean this off, apply a small amount of isopropyl alcohol to a microfiber cloth. Your cloth should be damp but not wet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-clean-dualsense-before.jpg"                      alt="How to clean dirty dualsense controller"                ></p><p> Then simply wipe down your controller. Although isopropyl alcohol evaporates very quickly, it is still a good idea to dry it off once you are done cleaning.</p><p> It is not uncommon for dust and dirt to become lodged in the joystick and work their way inside your controller causing drift. To remove this dust before it causes any problems, dip a Q-tip in a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and clean around the joysticks. Rotating the stick can help the Q-tip can get into all those hard-to-reach spaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-clean-ps5-dualsense-controller-dust-in-joystick-before-and-after.jpg"                      alt="How to clean ps5 dualsense controller dust in joystick before and after"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938716/19272" target="_top" id="1938716">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938716" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938716/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you are still experiencing drift even after cleaning your DualSense controller, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-drifting-ps5-dualsense-controller/" >how to fix drift in your PS5 controller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn about some potential solutions.</p><h2 id="Prevention-Is-the-Best-Cure"><a href="#Prevention-Is-the-Best-Cure" class="headerlink" title="Prevention Is the Best Cure"></a>Prevention Is the Best Cure</h2><p> Your console and controller are always going to get dusty regardless of the methods you use to prevent it, but there are certainly ways to help reduce the amount of dust that collects in your system.</p><p> The best way to prevent dust and dirt buildup in your console, in particular, is to avoid storing it on carpets or fluffy rugs. Having your system sitting on a fabric surface vastly increases the rate at which dust builds up in the fan. If your console seems to be getting dusty very quickly, try sitting it in an entertainment system or even on a tile or piece of wood on the carpet to separate it from the fabric.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Improve-Your-PS5’s-Lifespan-by-Cleaning-It-Regularly"><a href="#Improve-Your-PS5’s-Lifespan-by-Cleaning-It-Regularly" class="headerlink" title="Improve Your PS5’s Lifespan by Cleaning It Regularly"></a>Improve Your PS5’s Lifespan by Cleaning It Regularly</h2><p> Regularly cleaning your PS5 console and controllers might sound simple, but it can drastically improve the longevity of your system.

Sure, if you’re used to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-to-pay-for-mobile-games-rather-than-play-for-free/" >paying for mobile games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you’ll be used to this. But for those of us who usually stick to free games, not having to contend with these annoyances is a bonus.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Are-Netflix’s-Games-Worth-the-Subscription"><a href="#Are-Netflix’s-Games-Worth-the-Subscription" class="headerlink" title="Are Netflix’s Games Worth the Subscription?"></a>Are Netflix’s Games Worth the Subscription?</h2><p> On their own, Netflix games are probably not worth the subscription unless you’re a massive mobile gamer. If you are, then it’s worth looking through the list of Netflix games to see if there are enough there to justify signing up for Netflix. After all, with Netflix, you only commit to one month at a time.</p><p> If you already subscribe to Netflix, you’d be foolish not to check out these mobile games. I guarantee that at least a handful will entertain you. And if they don’t, you’ve simply wasted a little time (but no money).</p><p> Not watching at least some of the many movies and TV shows available on Netflix while paying for the service is foolish, and so is not playing some of the streaming service’s mobile game offerings.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-safeguarding-your-music-three-recording-approaches/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Safeguarding Your Music Three Recording Approaches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-cross-social-sharing/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Cross-Social Sharing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-easily-transform-youtube-music-into-mp3-for-mac-os/"><u>[New] In 2024, Easily Transform YouTube Music Into MP3 for Mac OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-rpg-heritage-clashing-with-new-age-designs-for-2024/"><u>[New] RPG Heritage Clashing with New-Age Designs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/android-users-how-to-free-up-space-by-cleaning-the-cache/"><u>Android Users: How to Free Up Space by Cleaning the Cache</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/connecting-controllers-perfectly-on-android-platforms/"><u>Connecting Controllers Perfectly on Android Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/efficiency-leap-for-s1500-scanner-new-driver-guide-revealed/"><u>Efficiency Leap for S1500 Scanner - New Driver Guide Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-the-future-of-gaming-with-amd-rdna-35/"><u>Exploring the Future of Gaming with AMD RDNA 3.5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-deal-with-insufficient-ram-notice-roblox-on-iphone/"><u>How to Deal with Insufficient RAM Notice (Roblox) on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-dominate-in-pokemon-games-on-your-ios-device/"><u>How to Dominate in Pokémon Games on Your iOS Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-professional-techniques-for-sims-4-live-action/"><u>In 2024, Professional Techniques for Sims 4 Live-Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/linkedin-has-added-games-but-heres-why-you-shouldnt-play-them/"><u>LinkedIn Has Added Games, but Here's Why You Shouldn't Play Them</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-zte-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/"><u>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your ZTE Phone?

Even if you’ve had yours for years, there are probably still plenty of things it can do that you don’t know about. Even things you take for granted, like turning it on, for example.</p><p> Did you know that there are approximately six different ways to turn your PS5 on? Most of them don’t even involve you touching it or being anywhere near it at all. If you want to trick your friends into thinking your PS5 is haunted by turning it on when they’re alone in the house, there are a couple of ways you can do so.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-Power-Button"><a href="#1-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-Power-Button" class="headerlink" title="1. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the Power Button"></a>1. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the Power Button</h2><p> Pressing the power button is the most common way that gamers turn their trusty PS5s on. Almost immediately after taking your brand new PS5 out of the box and plugging it in, your trigger finger is just itching to press that power button and see what all the PS5 hype is about. And that is probably how you still turn it on to this day.</p><p> But it is also, by far, the most boring way to turn on your PS5. Not to mention the most labor-intensive since you have to lift yourself out of the couch and walk yourself all the way over to it. Thankfully, there is a much easier way. In fact, there are a number of easier ways.</p><h2 id="2-Turn-Your-PS5-On-in-Safe-Mode"><a href="#2-Turn-Your-PS5-On-in-Safe-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Turn Your PS5 On in Safe Mode"></a>2. Turn Your PS5 On in Safe Mode</h2><p> But before we get to the easiest and most convenient ways to turn your PS5 on, there is one other way to turn your console on using the power button, and it’s quite possibly the most important one of them all. That’s turning your PS5 on in Safe Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/safe-mode-menu-on-ps5-console.jpg"                      alt="Safe Mode Menu On PS5 Console"                ></p><p> You can turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode by holding the button down for six to eight seconds until you hear a second longer beep. Safe Mode allows you to access the backend of your system, where you can address many technical issues you may be having with your console.</p><p> Hopefully, you will never have to turn your PS5 on in Safe Mode, but it can be a lifesaver if you’ve been experiencing issues so it’s important for every PS5 owner to know about<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-ps5-safe-mode/" >what Safe Mode is on the PS5 and how to use it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938721/19272" target="_top" id="1938721">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938721" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938721/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-Remote-Play"><a href="#3-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-Remote-Play" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Your PS5 on Using Remote Play"></a>3. Turn Your PS5 on Using Remote Play</h2><p> If you’ve got yourself all rugged up on the couch and leaving the warm embrace of your safe space doesn’t quite appeal to you, you can also turn your PS5 on with your mobile device. This is an excellent way to turn your PS5 on without moving an inch, but it does require a little bit of pre-planning.</p><p> To turn your PS5 on via Remote Play, you must have downloaded the Remote Play app and connected it to your PS5 console previously.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ps5-how-to-set-up-and-use-remote-play/" >Setting up Remote Play and using it to operate your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is quick and easy and allows you to do much more than just turn it on. With Remote Play, you can fully control your console through your phone, so you can play an entire campaign on your mobile if you want to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-PS-Button-on-Your-DualSense-Controller"><a href="#4-Turn-Your-PS5-On-by-Pressing-the-PS-Button-on-Your-DualSense-Controller" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the PS Button on Your DualSense Controller"></a>4. Turn Your PS5 On by Pressing the PS Button on Your DualSense Controller</h2><p> If you didn’t know that you can turn your PS5 on by pressing the PS button on your DualSense controller, your mind is about to be blown. This is by far the easiest way to turn your PS5 on, because even if your console may not always be within arm’s reach, there is a good chance your DualSense is calmly waiting for you on your coffee table.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/person-playing-on-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-rgb-lights.jpg"                      alt="Person Playing On PS5 DualSense Controller with RGB Lights"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And what’s easier than picking up your phone and pressing several buttons to find the PS or Remote Play app to turn your PS5 on? Picking up your DualSense controller and pushing one single button instead.</p><h2 id="5-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-the-PS-App"><a href="#5-Turn-Your-PS5-on-Using-the-PS-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Turn Your PS5 on Using the PS App"></a>5. Turn Your PS5 on Using the PS App</h2><p> If you don’t have Remote Play downloaded and set up on your PS5 yet, don’t worry! You can also turn your PS5 on through the PS App.</p><p> This is a different app than Remote Play, and it doesn’t allow you to play games via your phone, but it does have a lot of its own functionality. You can see screenshots you’ve taken on your console through the PS App, review trophies you’ve collected, as well as add and chat with friends.</p><p> And, of course, you can turn your PS5 on. To do that, make sure your console is in Rest Mode, open the app, press the<strong>controller icon</strong> at the bottom of the screen, and scroll to the game you want to play. As long as the game is currently installed on your PS5, you will be able to press<strong>Play on Console</strong> , and your PS5 will turn on for you.</p><h2 id="6-Turn-On-Your-PS5-With-Your-TV"><a href="#6-Turn-On-Your-PS5-With-Your-TV" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn On Your PS5 With Your TV"></a>6. Turn On Your PS5 With Your TV</h2><p> For those extra avid gamers out there, there is yet another way you can turn your PS5 on without going anywhere near it. You can set your console up to turn on as soon as you turn on your TV. This feature can be activated in a just couple of moments from your console’s settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/black-ps5-controller-in-a-person-s-hand-with-a-tv-in-the-background.jpg"                      alt="Black PS5 controller in a person&#39;s hand with a TV in the background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> It is only recommended for the most dedicated of gamers, however, who know that a majority of the time they turn their TV on, it will be to use their PS5. If not, it can be more bothersome than helpful to have your PS5 turning on every time you want to watch Netflix or the news. That just wastes power and requires more effort from you to turn it off again.</p><p> Thankfully, it is just as easy to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-ps5-turning-on-off-with-tv/" >stop your PS5 from turning on with your TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it is to activate the setting in the first place.</p><h2 id="Spice-Things-Up-a-Bit-Next-Time-You-Turn-On-Your-PS5"><a href="#Spice-Things-Up-a-Bit-Next-Time-You-Turn-On-Your-PS5" class="headerlink" title="Spice Things Up a Bit Next Time You Turn On Your PS5"></a>Spice Things Up a Bit Next Time You Turn On Your PS5</h2><p> Now that you are equipped with an entire arsenal of ways to turn your PS5 on, you can switch it up each time you are ready to boot up another adventure.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovating-Gaming-Graphics-with-Model-Simplification"><a href="#Innovating-Gaming-Graphics-with-Model-Simplification" class="headerlink" title="Innovating Gaming Graphics with Model Simplification"></a>Innovating Gaming Graphics with Model Simplification</h2><p> 3D game development has become a lot more accessible over the last decade. Engines like Unity and Unreal Engine make it easier than ever before to create beautiful 3D games without a huge budget, but there is still a lot to learn in this process.</p><p> Designing and optimizing 3D models for your games is a big part of this, and we’re here to help you out. Let’s explore some of the key practices and techniques that you can employ to optimize 3D models for game development.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="3D-Model-Game-Optimization-Development-Practices"><a href="#3D-Model-Game-Optimization-Development-Practices" class="headerlink" title="3D Model Game Optimization: Development Practices"></a>3D Model Game Optimization: Development Practices</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/room-3d-model.jpg"                      alt="room 3d model"                ></p><p> While a good deal of the work you can do to optimize 3D models for game development is done in your 3D design software, the game engine also gives you opportunities to make your game faster. These methods are easy to put to work, providing a good place to start if you have already begun development on your game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Reuse-3D-Model-Assets"><a href="#Reuse-3D-Model-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Reuse 3D Model Assets"></a>Reuse 3D Model Assets</h3><p> Every 3D model your game loads has a resource cost. This cost isn’t incurred when using a model for a second, third, or fourth time, providing an excellent opportunity to optimize your game without skimping on scenery or objects.</p><p> Asset reuse is very common in the video game development industry, and it’s something you should always consider when designing complex levels and scenes. Engines like Unity offer a prefabrication system to make this easier.</p><h3 id="Compress-Textures-and-Optimize-Shaders"><a href="#Compress-Textures-and-Optimize-Shaders" class="headerlink" title="Compress Textures and Optimize Shaders"></a>Compress Textures and Optimize Shaders</h3><p> Textures act like skin on the outside of a 3D object, adding patterns and other visual features to make the object look more real. Textures come in the form of image files, and each of these files needs to be loaded when it is used in a scene. By using compressed textures, you can free up a lot of resources.</p><p> Alongside using compressed textures, it’s also worth making sure that the shaders you use are well-optimized. Most game engines have an asset store with both free and paid shaders available to make this easier. You can also find<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/unity-free-assets-websites/" >free 3D models on the Unity Asset Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that are already optimized, and this applies to other engines, too.</p><h3 id="Use-Static-Lighting"><a href="#Use-Static-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Use Static Lighting"></a>Use Static Lighting</h3><p> Lighting is by far one of the most resource-hungry operations found in modern 3D games. Calculating reflections on the fly is very costly, but you can bake the lighting in your scene to solve this problem. This prepares the lighting in the scene in advance so that the player doesn’t have to wait for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Use-Occlusion-Culling"><a href="#Use-Occlusion-Culling" class="headerlink" title="Use Occlusion Culling"></a>Use Occlusion Culling</h3><p> Engines like Unity and Unreal Engine feature an optimization tool called occlusion culling. This reduces resource usage by only rendering the 3D objects that the player can see in the scene. Outside of the player’s field of view, objects will not appear until they are looked at. This is an easy way to save resource usage in large scenes.</p><h3 id="Implement-LOD-Level-of-Detail"><a href="#Implement-LOD-Level-of-Detail" class="headerlink" title="Implement LOD (Level of Detail)"></a>Implement LOD (Level of Detail)</h3><p> Detail becomes increasingly important as you get closer to an object in a video game. But, when you are far away, you don’t need to have every fine detail on display, and this is what LOD is for.</p><p> The engine can automatically remove polygons from an object’s mesh when the player is far away, lowering resource costs without impacting immersion.</p><h2 id="3D-Model-Game-Optimization-Design-Workflow"><a href="#3D-Model-Game-Optimization-Design-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="3D Model Game Optimization: Design Workflow"></a>3D Model Game Optimization: Design Workflow</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3d-designer.jpg"                      alt="3d designer working at PC"                ></p><p> Designing 3D models that are optimized for video game development is easier than you might expect. This process mostly involves stripping your model down to ensure that it only has the vertices, lines, and faces that it needs. There are several ways to achieve this.</p><h3 id="Manual-Geometry-Optimization"><a href="#Manual-Geometry-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Manual Geometry Optimization"></a>Manual Geometry Optimization</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/manual-3d-optimization.jpg"                      alt="monkey model in blender"                ></p><p> Optimizing simple geometry by hand is a good way to get used to designing models for video games. You have two main options for removing faces, lines, and vertices in 3D modeling software; deleting and dissolving.</p><p> Deleting a face removes it entirely, leaving an open space in your 3D object. Deleting a vertex or line will remove the faces that connect to them. Dissolve removes the face, vertex, or line you have selected, followed by filling in the gaps with new faces to keep the object solid.</p><p> There are a couple of things to look out for when you are removing polygons from your 3D geometry:</p><ul><li><strong>Remove Hidden Faces</strong> : Faces that the player will never see don’t need to be loaded into your game. The backs of buildings, the underside of a vehicle, and pieces of geometry that are below ground can usually be removed. This is the manual version of occlusion mapping.</li><li><strong>Remove Duplicate&#x2F;Redundant Faces</strong> : Duplicate faces should always be deleted, but you should also look for faces that aren’t necessary. A square, for example, only needs to have one face. If it has two triangular faces, dissolve them both to replace them with a single face.</li><li><strong>Object Merging</strong> : Loading one object is always better than loading two or three.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/merge-objects-in-blender/" >Merging 3D objects in Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/five-free-game-development-tools-make-your-own-games/" >other game development software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy, and it’s a great way to reduce your resource costs.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Automated-Geometry-Optimization"><a href="#Automated-Geometry-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Automated Geometry Optimization"></a>Automated Geometry Optimization</h3><p> Manual optimization works for simple 3D models, but you may need to use some automated tools to help with this process. You can use these methods in conjunction with one another to make your 3D models perfect for video game development.</p><ul><li><strong>Retopology</strong> : Retopology is the process of creating a new simplified mesh for an object. This can be done automatically in most 3D modeling tools, providing you with a mesh that has as few faces as possible. This is called Remesh in Blender, Retopologize in Maya, and Retopology tools in 3DS Max.</li><li><strong>Add-Ons</strong> : 3D modeling tools come with loads of features, but they can’t have everything built-in. Many of these tools have add-ons available to enhance their features. Game development optimization is covered here, with options like AP GameTools for Blender providing loads of unique features.</li><li><strong>Additional Software</strong> : Alongside add-ons, you can also find third-party software that can optimize your 3D models for video game development.<a class="link"   href="https://www.simplygon.com/" >Simplygon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a popular example of this, with a host of tools available that will make your optimization journey easier.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-Optimization-Do-3D-Models-Need-for-Game-Development"><a href="#How-Much-Optimization-Do-3D-Models-Need-for-Game-Development" class="headerlink" title="How Much Optimization Do 3D Models Need for Game Development?"></a>How Much Optimization Do 3D Models Need for Game Development?</h2><p> As you can see, optimizing your 3D objects is a time-consuming process. The results will be worth it, though, and it should be easy to tell how well you’ve done the job once you compile and run your game. You can always go back and make further optimizations if you need to. Now, you just need to learn where to find some beautiful textures for your objects.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-live-broadcasts-obs-tips-for-youtube-and-twitch/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Live Broadcasts OBS Tips for YouTube & Twitch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-pedagogy-through-film-in-the-classroom/"><u>[New] Pioneering Pedagogy Through Film in the Classroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-soundquality-synopsis-for-2024/"><u>[New] SoundQuality Synopsis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-expand-your-instagram-skills-advanced-use-of-queries-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expand Your Instagram Skills Advanced Use of Queries for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-uniting-your-feeds-posting-videos-from-twitter-on-snapchat-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Uniting Your Feeds Posting Videos From Twitter on Snapchat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/designing-family-approved-child-friendly-steam-games/"><u>Designing Family-Approved Child-Friendly Steam Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/duel-in-the-digital-the-two-paths-of-tetris-mastery/"><u>Duel in the Digital: The Two Paths of Tetris Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/fine-tuning-joystick-actions-on-the-xbox-one/"><u>Fine-Tuning Joystick Actions on the Xbox One</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/get-your-behringer-usb-audio-cable-drivers-today-download-and-learn-easily/"><u>Get Your Behringer USB Audio Cable Drivers Today – Download & Learn Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-sound-for-anthem-in-windows-pertinent-to-fix-no-audio-problem/"><u>How to Enable Sound for Anthem in Windows Pertinent to Fix: No Audio Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-screen-lock-pin-on-honor-play-8t-like-a-pro-5-easy-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Screen Lock PIN On Honor Play 8T Like A Pro 5 Easy Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/is-the-latest-nvidia-pass-a-boon-for-gamers/"><u>Is the Latest Nvidia Pass a Boon for Gamers?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/navigating-user-exchanges-on-twitch-live/"><u>Navigating User Exchanges on Twitch Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/optimal-vision-protection-eyegear/"><u>Optimal Vision Protection Eyegear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/pcs-best-bet-google-play-games-betas-essential-titles/"><u>PC's Best Bet: Google Play Games Beta's Essential Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/prime-voice-changers-essentials-for-video-makers-for-2024/"><u>Prime Voice Changers Essentials for Video Makers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/top-free-methods-converting-vob-files-into-avi-format/"><u>Top Free Methods: Converting VOB Files Into AVI Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-of-cs2-players-on-apple-systems/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets of CS2 Players on Apple Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/virtual-battles-the-9-best-and-worst-of-digital-gaming/"><u>Virtual Battles: The 9 Best and Worst of Digital Gaming</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You will see your friends online, but you will not be able to join in their games since they are using a different version of Fortnite from you. The only way to play is if they also use Macs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/almost-empty-outfit-section-in-fortnite-locker.jpeg"                      alt="Almost empty outfit section in Fortnite Locker"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Epic Games has also blocked access to V-Bucks and the Item Shop. So, you can’t buy new skins, emotes, gifts, back blings, or any other cosmetic items. And if you bought any on another device running a more recent version of Fortnite, you won’t see it in your inventory.</p><p> This, combined with its overly bloated size, makes the Fortnite experience on macOS very disappointing.</p><h2 id="How-to-Play-the-Latest-Version-of-Fortnite-on-Your-Mac"><a href="#How-to-Play-the-Latest-Version-of-Fortnite-on-Your-Mac" class="headerlink" title="How to Play the Latest Version of Fortnite on Your Mac"></a>How to Play the Latest Version of Fortnite on Your Mac</h2><p> Thanks to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-xbox-cloud-gaming-how-does-it-work/" >the Xbox Cloud Gaming service <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you can still play the latest version of Fortnite on a Mac via your browser. It’s typically a paid service that costs $16.99 per month, but you can access some free games like Fortnite without a subscription.</p><p> However, since Xbox Cloud Gaming streams Fortnite over the cloud, the video quality won’t be as good as running it natively on your Mac.

But ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection.

We have no evidence that suggests Epic Games will compromise and let Mac users play with everyone else again. It seems like the company has taken a stubborn stance and is waiting for a shift before taking decisive action.</p><p> This is mostly a bummer for gamers who just want to have some good old battle royale action without having to purchase a Windows PC. Since it’s unlikely Apple will change its App Store policies, we hope Epic Games makes a compromise soon.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-harmonizing-visuals-and-soundtracks-with-youtubes-video-editor/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Harmonizing Visuals & Soundtracks with YouTube's Video Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-how-to-find-youtube-hidden-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Find YouTube Hidden Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/10-masterpiece-scenes-to-perfect-your-edits-for-2024/"><u>10 Masterpiece Scenes to Perfect Your Edits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/become-a-streaming-pro-mastering-live-xbox-broadcasts-in-discord/"><u>Become a Streaming Pro: Mastering Live Xbox Broadcasts in Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/cheap-and-fast-optimal-240hz-gaming-setups/"><u>Cheap and Fast: Optimal 240Hz Gaming Setups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gaining-starfield-previews-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Gaining Starfield Previews: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-the-iphone-8-plus-sim-lock-4-easy-methods-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock The iPhone 8 Plus SIM Lock 4 Easy Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-motorola-moto-g34-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Motorola Moto G34 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://media-tips.techidaily.com/instant-conversion-techniques-for-playing-mxf-videos-on-your-iphone/"><u>Instant Conversion Techniques for Playing MXF Videos on Your iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/microtransactions-in-premium-gaming-rationale/"><u>Microtransactions in Premium Gaming - Rationale?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-zooms-audio-recording-features-with-ease-for-2024/"><u>Navigating ZOOM's Audio Recording Features with Ease for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/present-day-gaming-past-era-designs/"><u>Present-Day Gaming, Past-Era Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/rapid-response-elevating-counter-strike-fps-quickly/"><u>Rapid Response: Elevating Counter-Strike FPS Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/restricting-windows-11-game-bar-surveillance/"><u>Restricting Windows 11 Game Bar Surveillance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/update-drivers-with-device-manager-on-windows-11-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Update drivers with Device Manager on Windows 11</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
