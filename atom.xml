The top is synthetic vegan leather, offering your workspace a luxurious look and serving as a water-resistant layer. The back is a soft cork which prevents the mat from slipping around during use and won’t damage your desktop.</p><p> Nordik went all out with the finishing touches on this desk mat, including premium features such as stitched edges for durability and a built-in cable organizer. It can get expensive, but it’s hard to beat this great product if you need the best desk mat on the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nordik.png"                      alt="Nordik"                ></p><p>Best Overall</p><h5 id="Nordik-Cork-Leather-Desk-Mat-1"><a href="#Nordik-Cork-Leather-Desk-Mat-1" class="headerlink" title="Nordik Cork Leather Desk Mat"></a>Nordik Cork Leather Desk Mat</h5><p> Although it’s a bit expensive, the Nordik Cork Leather Desk Mat is built to high standards and is ideal for both working and gaming.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Gorgeous design</li><li>Multiple colors</li><li>Highly durable</li><li>Built-in cable organizer</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B094JQ2T73?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-desk-mats/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >See at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Budget-Desk-Mat-YSAGi-Leather-Desk-Pad-Protector"><a href="#Best-Budget-Desk-Mat-YSAGi-Leather-Desk-Pad-Protector" class="headerlink" title="Best Budget Desk Mat: YSAGi Leather Desk Pad Protector"></a>Best Budget Desk Mat: YSAGi Leather Desk Pad Protector</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ysagi-1.jpg"                      alt="YSAGi PU leather desk mat with a laptop, mouse, phone, and notebook on top"                ></p><p>YSAGi</p><p> You don’t need to spend heaps of money to get a reliable desk mat.

And while it’s usually incredibly affordable anyway, it frequently goes on sale, making it all the more enticing.</p><p> Though its materials aren’t quite as fancy as the premium leather desk mats, the YSAGi mat uses a similar two-layer approach. The top is PU leather that’s waterproof and protects from scratches, while the back is a suede-type material that secures the mat in place during use. Be sure to give it a look if you need something affordable, protective, and highly customizable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ysagi.png"                      alt="YSAGi"                ></p><p>Best Budget</p><h5 id="YSAGi-Leather-Desk-Pad-Protector-1"><a href="#YSAGi-Leather-Desk-Pad-Protector-1" class="headerlink" title="YSAGi Leather Desk Pad Protector"></a>YSAGi Leather Desk Pad Protector</h5><p> Although this isn’t the most luxurious desk mat on the market, it’s affordable, reliable, and available in a wide range of colors.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Durable PU leather</li><li>Several colors and patterns</li><li>Multiple sizes</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Limited to a one-year warranty</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/YSAGi-Leather-Protector-Non-Slip-Waterproof/dp/B0BVVR6FNY?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2032236&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-desk-mats/&asc_campaign=Commerce" >$10 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Best-Desk-Mat-for-Gaming-Razer-Gigantus-V2"><a href="#Best-Desk-Mat-for-Gaming-Razer-Gigantus-V2" class="headerlink" title="Best Desk Mat for Gaming: Razer Gigantus V2"></a>Best Desk Mat for Gaming: Razer Gigantus V2</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gigantus-1.jpg"                      alt="Razer Gigantus V2 desk mat in various sizes on top of each other"                ></p><p>Razer</p><p> Razer is an icon in the gaming world, so it should be no surprise that it produces the best desk mat for gamers.

Best of all, it uses a premium textured micro-weave cloth surface for enhanced control over your mouse movements during intense gaming sessions.</p><p> Whether you need something for a compact desk or sprawling battle station, you’ll find a Gigantus V2 that fits your setup. And while Razer loves to create gadgets with edgy gamer aesthetics, this desk mat is surprisingly understated. The top is black with a few neon green accents, while the bottom is bright neon green (though you’ll only see the edges once placed on your desk).

It’s reasonably affordable and ships in a tiny box that makes it cheap to store and distribute.</p><p>But what is in that box?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-vents.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro"                ></p><p> You get the PC, measuring 5.89 x 3.06 x 7.42 inches (weighing 863 grams, or 30oz), a mains power adapter, power cable, HDMI cable, and a quick start guide. Unsurprisingly, you’ll need to provide your own keyboard and mouse and any other peripherals or input devices.</p><p> Setting it up takes a few seconds, and within a minute you can be configuring Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. Of course, getting through the Windows 11 setup can take a while, and once that’s done you’ll need to install a gaming platform or sign into PC Game Pass.</p><p> But once you’re done with that, it’s time to start installing and playing games.</p><h2 id="Who-Is-This-Mini-Gaming-PC-For"><a href="#Who-Is-This-Mini-Gaming-PC-For" class="headerlink" title="Who Is This Mini Gaming PC For?"></a>Who Is This Mini Gaming PC For?</h2><p> Usually, when reviewing computers, it is clear who the device is aimed at. A laptop for anyone who needs to work anywhere (office&#x2F;coffee shop&#x2F;train&#x2F;school or college). Desktop PCs are for office-anchored staff, small shops, or ticket management at legacy entertainment businesses (bowling alleys, cinema chains, etc.).</p><p> At the other end of the scale, Raspberry Pis are for enthusiasts, tinkerers, and makers.</p><p>So who would want an AceMagic AM08 Pro?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-bedroom.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro in bedroom"                ></p><p>  I’ll tell you: teens. More specifically, teenagers who want an upgradeable system for gaming (unlike a laptop). Kids over 12 that are looking for a system that has the space and processing power to handle 4K video authoring.</p><p> Fortunately, I have a couple of children in this exact age range. One of them, Bruce, has helped by providing space in his bedroom and considerable time testing various games.</p><h2 id="AceMagic-AM08-Pro-Device-Specifications"><a href="#AceMagic-AM08-Pro-Device-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="AceMagic AM08 Pro Device Specifications"></a>AceMagic AM08 Pro Device Specifications</h2><p> Two versions of the AceMagic Pro PC are available: the AM08 AMD model and the AD08 Intel variant (with an Intel Core i9 CPU). We received the AMD model, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX CPU (8 cores, 16 threads) with an AMD Radeon 680M GPU. (This is the same GPU as the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/review-gpd-win-4-handheld-console-review/" >GPD Win 4 handheld <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><p> The reviewed computer has 32GB of DDR5 RAM (a 16GB option is available), upgradable to 64GBs, with a 512GB M.2 SSD (PCIe NVME) and 4 x USB 3.2 Type-A ports (two at the front, two on the back). Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 provide wireless connectivity. Audio in and out can be handled with the 3.5mm port, mounted on the front.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-rear-ports-1.JPG"                      alt="HDMI and Ethernet ports"                ></p><p> Up to three 4K displays can be connected to this computer. Dual HDMI ports are mounted on the device, along with a USB 4.0 Type-C port. This handles other data besides display output.</p><p> In addition, the power button is mounted on a fan performance selector rocker switch. Affording control over the high-performance dual fans, this switches between Low, Normal, and Performance, with the middle option the default.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-leds-1.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro LEDs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080347/19272" target="_top" id="2080347">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080347" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080347/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Windows 11 Pro is preinstalled, and the computer comes with AceMagic’s 30-day refund and return and a 3-year warranty.</p><p> A quick note on the size: the user guide indicates that the computer can be mounted on the back of a monitor using a VESA attachment, but no plate is included in the box.</p><p>Perhaps most surprisingly, this unit is expandable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-Can-Upgrade-the-AceMagic-AM08-Pro"><a href="#You-Can-Upgrade-the-AceMagic-AM08-Pro" class="headerlink" title="You Can Upgrade the AceMagic AM08 Pro"></a>You Can Upgrade the AceMagic AM08 Pro</h2><p> The right-hand side of the AM08 Pro (as viewed from the front) is secured only by magnets. Enabling easy access to the RAM and storage media, the side plate is simple to remove and replace, eschewing thumbscrews.</p><p> You’ll find an empty SATA port for a 2.5-inch storage device inside. Beneath this is the M.2 storage, while positioned higher in the case are the dual RAM sticks. All of these items can be removed and upgraded with relative ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-ports.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro expansion ports"                ></p><p> Admittedly, these are laptop-style upgrades, but they’re upgrades nevertheless. It’s enough to give this machine a bit of longevity.</p><p> One thing to note about the hardware is the wireless networking. I live in a small house, and the computer was set up in a room near our router (about 12 feet diagonally). However, there seemed to be an issue maintaining a strong Wi-Fi signal. This isn’t an issue with the room, as a tablet computer is regularly used there.</p><p> This may be a quirk of the review device (I checked with the AceMagic people and the problem could not be replicated), but it was easily dealt with thanks to a powerline adapter. While your own experience may differ, this is worth keeping in mind.</p><h2 id="Gaming-on-the-AceMagic-AM08-Pro"><a href="#Gaming-on-the-AceMagic-AM08-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Gaming on the AceMagic AM08 Pro"></a>Gaming on the AceMagic AM08 Pro</h2><p> Since this is marketed as a gaming PC, we opted for games that would really push the AceMagic AM08 Pro. Relying on Steam, Bruce installed:</p><ul><li>Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</li><li>Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order (2019)</li><li>Humankind (2021)</li><li>He also tried Minecraft and Apex Legends, seemingly perennially-updated titles</li></ul><p> And… they all played absolutely perfectly. It really is incredible that a small unit like this should be able to deliver such excellent gaming performance.</p><p> In term of noise levels, the system isn’t too bad, although when the selector knob is set to Performance, it does get a bit loud. But it’s still far quieter than a traditional desktop.</p><p> Most importantly, our 12-year-old is seriously impressed, to the extent that he wants to keep it. I’d say that was a pretty good point in the AceMagic AM08 Pro’s favor.</p><h2 id="What-About-PC-Tasks-That-Aren’t-Games"><a href="#What-About-PC-Tasks-That-Aren’t-Games" class="headerlink" title="What About PC Tasks That Aren’t Games?"></a>What About PC Tasks That Aren’t Games?</h2><p> Something as small and relatively cheap as the AM08 Pro is likely to attract attention as a gift. With Windows 11 Pro preinstalled, it is ready-made for media production, and suitable for everything from homework to online shopping.</p><p>But how does this work out in practice?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-usb.JPG"                      alt="USB Ports"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938677/19272" target="_top" id="1938677">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938677" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938677/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> To find out, we edited a video, and later I updated my blog. I then made an important Amazon purchase (and as I write this, I’m hoping I remembered to log out…)</p><p> It should be no surprise to read that it handled them all perfectly. But then, all it has done throughout this review is surprise. Sure, it is a tiny computer, but it appears to be just as capable as any standard PC.</p><h2 id="No-It’s-Not-a-Gaming-PC-But-It’ll-Do"><a href="#No-It’s-Not-a-Gaming-PC-But-It’ll-Do" class="headerlink" title="No, It’s Not a Gaming PC, But It’ll Do"></a>No, It’s Not a Gaming PC, But It’ll Do</h2><p> By this point, you’re probably thinking one of two things: “There’s no way that’s really a gaming PC” or “Wow, a gaming PC for $500!”.</p><p> Both opinions are right. If you’re a hardcore gamer, this system—LEDs aside—is not for you. It’s baseline stuff; cooling control is useful but nothing hardcore, and you won’t be able to push this system to extremes. You need a totally different setup, let’s be honest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-vents-1.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro"                ></p><p> But if you’re new to gaming and found a standard laptop doesn’t do the job, then the AceMagic AM08 Pro will blow your mind. It produces excellent results with recent games, and while you may need to dial back the graphics quality for newer titles, it can still cope.</p><h2 id="An-Entry-Level-Gaming-PC-Ideal-for-Teens"><a href="#An-Entry-Level-Gaming-PC-Ideal-for-Teens" class="headerlink" title="An Entry Level Gaming PC Ideal for Teens"></a>An Entry Level Gaming PC Ideal for Teens</h2><p> When I was first asked to review the AceMagic AM08 Pro, I was naturally dubious about its billing.</p><p> While the term “gaming PC” isn’t in its official website description, it is listed under gaming devices (along with the more expensive AceMagic G1).</p><p> Yet it has taken me totally by surprise, providing gaming and desktop performance that you can be confident with. With no noticeable performance drops, low latency 4K output, and space to expand RAM and storage, the AceMagic AM08 Pro delivers everything you want from a PC that would typically cost twice as much. It’s as much a gaming system as it is an office workhorse.</p><p> Essentially, this isn’t a “gaming PC” for people who live and breathe games, but it is a gaming PC for people who like games enough to spend a bit of time on them and expect them to be playable. Oh, and teenagers. Teens will love the AceMagic AM08 Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/muo-reviews-acemagicianam08-leds-1.JPG"                      alt="ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro LEDs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="ACEMAGICIAN-ACEMAGIC-AM08-Pro-1"><a href="#ACEMAGICIAN-ACEMAGIC-AM08-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="ACEMAGICIAN ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro"></a>ACEMAGICIAN ACEMAGIC AM08 Pro</h5><p> 8&#x2F; 10</p><p> While not for hardcore gaming, the AM08 Pro is perfect for casual gamers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enabling-Remote-Play-on-PS5-Console"><a href="#Enabling-Remote-Play-on-PS5-Console" class="headerlink" title="Enabling Remote Play on PS5 Console"></a>Enabling Remote Play on PS5 Console</h2><p> To share a physical game with another PlayStation 5 owner, you just hand them the disc, and that’s it. Sharing a digital game, however, requires some extra steps, and you can do it through the PS5’s game share feature. Thankfully, it’s relatively easy to enable and disable as you please.</p><p>Here’s how you can game share on PS5.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-Game-Sharing-on-PS5"><a href="#What-Is-Game-Sharing-on-PS5" class="headerlink" title="What Is Game Sharing on PS5?"></a>What Is Game Sharing on PS5?</h2><p> PS5 game share is a feature that allows you to share your digital games with friends and family so they can play them on their PS5 as if they own them. It’s slightly different from<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-gameshare-on-ps4/" >game sharing on PS4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since you don’t set the other PS5 as the primary console. Rather, you link your PSN account to the other console and enable an option called<strong>Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong> .</p><p> Do not confuse game sharing with<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-share-ps5-games-share-play/" >Share Play on PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The former gives the other person full access to your digital library so they can play the games on their user account, while the latter only gives them temporary access to your user account so they can play your games.</p><p> Furthermore, if you have a<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-playstation-plus/" >PlayStation Plus subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , you will also share it with them, meaning they will be able to access certain PS Plus benefits. These include playing the games in your PS Plus game library (including titles in the classic catalog) and having access to online multiplayer. Benefits they can’t use include saving game progress to the cloud and claiming PS Plus discounts and free monthly games.</p><h2 id="How-to-Game-Share-on-PS5"><a href="#How-to-Game-Share-on-PS5" class="headerlink" title="How to Game Share on PS5"></a>How to Game Share on PS5</h2><p> You can only enable game sharing on one PS5 console at a time, meaning you’ll need to disable it on your main PS5 console before you enable it on another. Keep in mind that, once you do this, you won’t be able to access your digital games offline, as your console will need an internet connection to verify ownership of the titles on the PSN server.</p><p> Anyone on your primary console who was playing your digital games on their account before you disabled game sharing will lose access to those titles when you enable game sharing on another console.</p><p> To enable game sharing on another PS5 console, the first thing you need to do is make sure you’ve connected your PS5 to the internet and that you’ve<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-sign-into-playstation-network-account/" >logged into your PSN account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Then, follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>On the home screen, select<strong>Settings</strong> (the gear icon) in the top-right corner.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/improved-user-interface.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of PS5 home screen"                ></li><li>Select<strong>User and Accounts &gt; Other</strong> on the left side menu, and then select<strong>Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong> on the right.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/user-and-accounts-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the other page of the ps5 user and accounts settings screen"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Disable</strong> to turn off game sharing on your console.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/console-sharing-and-offline-play-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the console sharing and offline play settings screen on ps5"                ></li><li>On the other PS5, connect it to the internet and log into your PSN account. If you don’t have an existing account on that console, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-a-new-ps5-user-and-guest-account/" >create a new user account on that PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong> screen (steps one and two above).</li><li>Select<strong>Enable</strong> this time around to enable game sharing on that console.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/enabling-game-sharing-on-ps5.jpg"                      alt="enabling game sharing on PS5"                ></li><li>Download the game your friend or family member wants to play, and they will be able to access it from their account.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/download-witch-complete-version-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the download page of the Witcher 3 on PS5"                ></li></ol><p> If you’re having problems downloading games after game sharing, it could be due to licensing issues. To fix that, go to<strong>Settings &gt; User and Accounts &gt; Other</strong> and select<strong>Restore Licenses</strong> . Doing this will refresh the licenses of all the digital games in your library so you can download and play them with no problems.</p><p> To protect your PSN account, you should never share your login credentials with anyone. That’s why we recommend that when signing in and enabling game sharing on another person’s PlayStation 5, you do it in person.</p><p> When you no longer wish to game share, just disable<strong>Console Sharing and Offline Play</strong> on the other PS5, and re-enable it on yours.</p><h2 id="Now-You’re-Ready-to-Game-Share-on-PS5"><a href="#Now-You’re-Ready-to-Game-Share-on-PS5" class="headerlink" title="Now You’re Ready to Game Share on PS5"></a>Now You’re Ready to Game Share on PS5</h2><p> PS5 game sharing is a great way to let others play your digital games without having to purchase copies of their own. Not only does this save them money when it comes to game purchases, but it also means they don’t need a PS Plus subscription of their own, especially if they just want online multiplayer.</p><p> And if your friend or family member has a game in their digital library that you want to play, just have them enable their account’s game sharing feature on your PS5 console. That way, you can play each other’s games and effectively double the savings.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-streamlining-the-process-dells-way-to-screen-recording/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamlining the Process Dell's Way to Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/ai-portrait-generator-getting-closer-to-the-artistic-marvels-for-2024/"><u>AI Portrait Generator Getting Closer to the Artistic Marvels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhancing-system-efficiency-prioritize-these-8-cpu-cooling-factors/"><u>Enhancing System Efficiency: Prioritize These 8 CPU Cooling Factors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/five-inventive-jabberwocky-rounds-for-humorous-texting/"><u>Five Inventive Jabberwocky Rounds for Humorous Texting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-tecno-camon-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Netflix Location to Get More Country Version On Tecno Camon 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On OnePlus Nord N30 SE? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/premier-streaming-platforms-reviewed-and-rated/"><u>Premier Streaming Platforms Reviewed & Rated</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-oculus-installation-error-in-windows-os/"><u>Resolving Oculus Installation Error in Windows OS</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigating-Non-Hybrid-Futures-in-Today’s-Workplace-Insights-From-ZDNet"><a href="#Navigating-Non-Hybrid-Futures-in-Today’s-Workplace-Insights-From-ZDNet" class="headerlink" title="Navigating Non-Hybrid Futures in Today’s Workplace - Insights From ZDNet"></a>Navigating Non-Hybrid Futures in Today’s Workplace - Insights From ZDNet</h2><p>However, others may not have found such advantages and could not wait to get back on premises.</p><p>The result is that employers are likely to find themselves with employees who either want to be back in the office all the time or none of the time – or some variation in between.</p><p>Whereas once employers had little flexibility regarding a person’s working location, many are now fearful this will see them lose the productivity uplift that home-based employees delivered – or even lose them as employees altogether.</p><p>The standard answer is hybrid working – a concept that sees only part of the workforce on premises at any given time. However, this definition of hybrid work creates a potential problem when planning for the future of work, with too much emphasis placed on the location of the employee and not on the actual work they are trying to do.</p><p>A commonly accepted approach to the future of work is needed – one that is human-centric, and that recognises that ‘work’ is a thing a person does rather than a place they go to – and then aims for the best worker outcome.</p><h3 id="Workstyles-not-workplaces"><a href="#Workstyles-not-workplaces" class="headerlink" title="Workstyles, not workplaces"></a><strong>Workstyles, not workplaces</strong></h3><p>A good starting point for planning for the future of work is not to focus on the place where work is done but the style of work a person performs.</p><p>Unlike some industries where employees need to be on location to perform a task, such as truck drivers or warehouse workers, when it comes to office work and knowledge workers, the tendency has been to equip everyone with a desk, a computer, and a network connection, and assume that will cater to their needs. This 1970s style of thinking ignores the fact that many workers are doing very different kinds of work, and therefore may have very different needs.</p><p>For example, some work is highly collaborative, such as brainstorming and reviewing ideas, and requires frequent group meetings. Other work is best undertaken in a distraction-free environment, such as writing up proposals or critiquing the output of a colleague. How this distinction between collaboration and concentration is catered for in the workplace is likely to have a strong influence on a person’s productivity, and when handled poorly, can be a source of ongoing frustration. Some organisations are approaching this by implementing Activity-Based Working (ABW) environments, which provide a combination of open office design spaces with task-orientated, quiet zones. </p><p>The nature of modern knowledge work also means that many employees are likely to switch between different workstyles, often multiple times within a day. A culture that is inclusive and supportive of different work styles can be part of the foundation for designing a future of work that is focused on trust, choice, and outcomes. </p><h3 id="Supporting-workstyles"><a href="#Supporting-workstyles" class="headerlink" title="Supporting workstyles"></a><strong>Supporting workstyles</strong></h3><p>Once an employer has a clear understanding of the work a person is tasked to complete and the workstyles they will employ, they can make plans for where that work should be undertaken and for the tools the worker will use.</p><p>For example, someone who will be changing working styles frequently may be also moving between remote and on-premises locations on a regular basis. From a technology perspective, this means they are likely to be best served by a highly portable device connected to highspeed mobile broadband.</p><p>However, a worker who is primarily working on high-concentration tasks remotely might require a more powerful device connected to a highspeed fixed broadband connection, while an office-based worker could require a similar device but tethered to the local office network. </p><p>Should they need to collaborate with workers in other locations, they will require suitable collaboration technology, such as high-quality video and audio solutions. The office worker might also require a separate area away from their desk so as not to be distracted, or to distract others around them. </p><p>In these situations, the quality of the broadband connections they use will be critical.</p><p>This need for high quality devices and robust highspeed communications is what makes the Optus and Cisco alliance so powerful. </p><p>Optus brings close to thirty years’ experience in wide- and local-area communications for both voice and data, having worked with some of Australia’s most prominent employers to properly equip staff in the various places where they are located – including in some of Australia’s most remote locations.</p><p>Cisco brings almost 40 years of experience in networking technology, backed by an unrivalled reputation for security and reliability. This includes Webex, an extensive suite of collaboration software and hardware, designed to provide the best possible experiences for people working in any scenario.</p><p>By working in partnership Optus and Cisco bring together their respective strengths to create modern work scenarios that are powerful and flexible while also helping to the technology management burden for employers.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The pandemic has shown us that greater workplace flexibility is not only possible, but also has the potential to be highly productive. There is an opportunity to design and deliver a future of work that improves worker outcomes, a fact that many organisations already knew but has now become a more common reality out of necessity.</p><p>Employers now have the capabilities to fundamentally redesign the workplace and shift the emphasis on ‘place’ to ‘outcomes’. That means recognising that a diverse workforce can exist harmoniously and that technology strategies need to support this diversity - not as an exception but as a regular consideration going forward.</p><p>By taking a human-centric approach to the workplace of the future, employers can make investments today that will deliver a happier and more productive workforce.

Most of the time, it’s a minor glitch that you can fix by restarting Epic Games Launcher or re-authenticating your account.</p><p> Even if it’s a more serious problem, we’ve put together a list of solutions to help you get your games back.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Refresh-the-Library"><a href="#1-Refresh-the-Library" class="headerlink" title="1. Refresh the Library"></a>1. Refresh the Library</h2><p> Sometimes, Epic Games Launcher might have a syncing issue and fail to display newly bought games. In this case, all you have to do is refresh the library. Within the desktop app, open the<strong>Library</strong> and click on the<strong>Refresh</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/refresh-library-1.jpg"                      alt="How to refresh the Epic Games library"                ></p><h2 id="2-Restart-the-Epic-Games-Launcher"><a href="#2-Restart-the-Epic-Games-Launcher" class="headerlink" title="2. Restart the Epic Games Launcher"></a>2. Restart the Epic Games Launcher</h2><p> If refreshing the library didn’t fix the issue, try restarting the Epic Games Launcher app. This way, you stop its processes from running in the background and give it a fresh start. Once you close the app, press<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to bring up the Task Manager.</p><p> Open the<strong>Processes</strong> tab and stop any Epic Games-related process from running.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/end-epic-games-1.jpg"                      alt="Stop Epic Games from running in the background"                ></p><p> Then, relaunch the app and check if all of your games are now showing within the library.</p><h2 id="3-Log-Out-and-Log-In-to-Epic-Game"><a href="#3-Log-Out-and-Log-In-to-Epic-Game" class="headerlink" title="3. Log Out and Log In to Epic Game"></a>3. Log Out and Log In to Epic Game</h2><p> Another quick fix that you can try is to log out and log back in. This way, you force Epic Games Launcher to verify your account information and display your complete library. Also, make sure you’ve logged in using the right account.</p><p> If there’s someone else with an Epic Games account using the same device as you, you’ll see only the games purchased by their account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896527/19272" target="_top" id="1896527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896527/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Check-the-Game’s-Availability"><a href="#4-Check-the-Game’s-Availability" class="headerlink" title="4.

Unhide the Game Library</h2><p> Epic Games allows you to hide your games in case you don’t want a younger sibling to play games with inappropriate content. Or if you don’t want to lose your competitive rank. Either way, if you can’t find any games, you should check if you didn’t hide them.</p><p> In the Epic Games app, click on your profile icon and go to Settings. Then, from the<strong>Preferences</strong> section, uncheck the<strong>Hide Game Library</strong> option. Once you go back to your library, you should see your games list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/hide-game-library-1.jpg"                      alt="How to unhide the Epic Games library"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Remove-Library-Filters"><a href="#6-Remove-Library-Filters" class="headerlink" title="6.

If certain titles are missing from your library, chances are you’ve set a filter and forgot about it. To check out every title in your library, you should remove Epic Games library filters.</p><p> In the Library tab, click on<strong>Filters</strong> and uncheck the options.

This means that the Steam client has failed to sync the game’s progress with Steam Cloud.</p><p> There could be several reasons behind this; Steam servers or your internet connection could be down, local or game files could be corrupt, the cloud synchronization feature could be turned off, or the game session could be in progress somewhere else. If you’re tired of dealing with this issue, here are a few fixes you can try.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Don’t-Jump-Into-the-Game-Just-Yet…"><a href="#Don’t-Jump-Into-the-Game-Just-Yet…" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Jump Into the Game Just Yet…"></a>Don’t Jump Into the Game Just Yet…</h2><p> If you encounter the “unable to sync” error while trying to run a game, that means Steam has been unable to save your game progress from your last session. Therefore, if you launch the game right now, Steam may launch the game with your old saves, which will cause you to lose any saves you made before the error started.</p><p> Since running the game again can cost you hours of progress, we recommend you solve the primary problem first, then run the game.</p><h2 id="1-Enable-Steam-Cloud-in-the-Steam-Settings"><a href="#1-Enable-Steam-Cloud-in-the-Steam-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Steam Cloud in the Steam Settings"></a>1. Enable Steam Cloud in the Steam Settings</h2><p> Steam lets you control if your games use the Steam Cloud synchronization feature or not. Turning off this feature in your account settings can lead to sync issues and other errors. Therefore, it’s imperative to ensure that this feature isn’t turned off.</p><p>To check that, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Launch Steam.</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Steam</strong> tab and select<strong>Settings</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-go-to-settings-in-the-steam-tab-of-the-steam-client.jpg"                      alt="Go to Settings in the Steam Tab of the Steam Client"                ></li><li>Go to the<strong>Cloud</strong> tab on the left sidebar and turn on the toggle next to<strong>Enable Steam Cloud</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2-ensure-the-steam-cloud-option-is-enabled-in-the-cloud-tab-of-steam-settings.jpg"                      alt="Ensure the Steam Cloud Option Is Enabled in the Cloud Tab of Steam Settings"                ></li><li>If the toggle is already on, move it to the left to disable it.

Therefore, it’s a good idea to double-check that the Steam servers aren’t down or going through maintenance.</p><p> To check that, visit the<a class="link"   href="https://steamstat.us/" >Steam Status website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , find the data for the region you’re in on the website, then check whether the servers are online or not in your area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/check-steam-status-on-the-steam-stat-website.jpg"                      alt="Check Steam Status on the Steam Stat Website"                ></p><p> If servers are down or experiencing technical difficulties, wait a few hours until Steam fixes the backend issue, and your game progress should be saved automatically after that.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Check-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#3-Check-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3.

Therefore, ensure that your device is connected to the internet and that a lack of internet access is not interfering with the Steam client’s operation.</p><p> Try opening a web browser on your PC and see if you can access any websites.

Perform Some Quick Checks on Your Windows PC</h2><p> After verifying that the Steam servers are live, and your internet connection is working, that means the problem likely lies in either Steam or the game you’re trying to play.</p><p> Perform these quick and easy checks, as they may resolve the problem with minimal effort:</p><ul><li>Close the currently running game, turn off Steam, and start the client again.</li><li>If you are logged into Steam only on one device, log out once and log back in to rule out any temporary account problems.</li><li>If you play the problematic game across multiple devices, ensure that the game isn’t currently running on any of your other devices.</li><li>Ensure you don’t have Steam logged in on multiple devices.

As such, you must configure the Steam client to keep your game updated automatically.</p><p>Follow these steps to do that:</p><ol><li>Launch Steam and go to the<strong>Library</strong> tab.</li><li>Right-click the problematic game and select<strong>Properties</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Updates</strong> from the left sidebar.</li><li>Select<strong>Always keep this game updated</strong> from the dropdown menu under<strong>Automatic updates</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/6-select-always-keep-this-game-updated-from-the-dropdown-menu-under-automatic-updates-in-game-s-properties.jpg"                      alt="Select Always Keep this Game Updated From the Dropdown Menu Under Automatic Updates in Game’s Properties"                ></li></ol><p>Once the game is up-to-date, try syncing your Steam saves again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Don’t-Lose-Progress-in-Your-Steam-Games-on-Windows"><a href="#Don’t-Lose-Progress-in-Your-Steam-Games-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Lose Progress in Your Steam Games on Windows"></a>Don’t Lose Progress in Your Steam Games on Windows</h2><p> Steam not syncing your game’s progress and displaying the error can be extremely annoying.

Different types of games may require different types of mice, so choose one that suits your gaming style.</li><li>Upgrading to a high-refresh-rate gaming monitor can greatly improve your gaming experience. A good monitor complements a good gaming mouse for optimal hand-eye coordination.</li></ul><p> What you use to play your games could be stopping you from reaching your full potential. We’re here to show you what gaming gear you’ll need to get good at your games.</p><h2 id="How-Gaming-Gear-Affects-Your-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#How-Gaming-Gear-Affects-Your-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="How Gaming Gear Affects Your Gaming Performance"></a>How Gaming Gear Affects Your Gaming Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/monitor-angled-upwards-1.JPG"                      alt="monitor angled upwards-1"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> Having good gear doesn’t make you a good gamer. However, if you’re a good gamer with bad gear, your hardware can hold you back.</p><p> Cheap, unresponsive, and terrible quality gear can severely hinder your performance and slow down your progress toward becoming the best you can be. It might be worth spending a little bit more money on things that will last longer and help you reach your full potential.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Mice-Translating-Your-Real-World-Movements-Better"><a href="#Gaming-Mice-Translating-Your-Real-World-Movements-Better" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Mice: Translating Your Real-World Movements Better"></a>Gaming Mice: Translating Your Real-World Movements Better</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/normal-mouse-beside-flipped-mouse.jpg"                      alt="Normal mouse beside flipped mouse"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> A good gaming mouse is extremely important, as it’s your direct connection to your game. You want your movements in real life to be translated into the game as accurately as possible to ensure that your aim goes where you want it.</p><p> However, it’s not just about a good gaming mouse. It’s about getting the right gaming mouse. The right gaming mouse for an FPS player might be different for a MOBA or MMORPG player. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fps-gaming-mouse-key-characteristics/" >things you need to look for in an FPS mouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will apply to most other games, but you might want more buttons in addition to that for games like MMORPGs for easier access to many inputs.</p><p> If you don’t have a good mouse, you’re seriously hindering your performance by having imprecise inputs, potentially making you miss crucial split-second clicks. Whether it’s to land a skill in a MOBA or line up a headshot in an FPS, you want your mouse movement to go where you want it to go.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Monitors-Improve-Performance-With-More-Visual-Information"><a href="#Gaming-Monitors-Improve-Performance-With-More-Visual-Information" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Monitors: Improve Performance With More Visual Information"></a>Gaming Monitors: Improve Performance With More Visual Information</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/titanfall-2-on-monitor-4.JPG"                      alt="titanfall 2 on monitor"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> If you’re still running a 60Hz monitor while your PC is churning out more than 100 frames per second, you’re missing out on a lot of information that your computer wants to give you. While it gets pretty expensive to get a 360Hz monitor to see every single frame your PC churns out, getting at least a 144Hz monitor will make a big difference to your experience.</p><p> We suggest checking out some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-165hz-monitors/" >best 165Hz monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , though. 144Hz monitors are becoming a thing of the past and the new gaming baseline is 165Hz.</p><p> Besides the refresh rate of your monitor, you should also pay attention to the response times. You should aim for a monitor with at least 5 ms or less response time. If the response time of your monitor is slow despite having a high refresh rate, you’ll end up with a lot of ghosting and blurry images that will hurt your accuracy.</p><p> A good gaming monitor goes hand in hand with a good gaming mouse because of hand-eye coordination. The sooner you see something on your monitor, the sooner your hand can react and hit the right targets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Good-Gaming-Controller-Precise-Inputs-and-Accessibility"><a href="#A-Good-Gaming-Controller-Precise-Inputs-and-Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="A Good Gaming Controller: Precise Inputs and Accessibility"></a>A Good Gaming Controller: Precise Inputs and Accessibility</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/close-up-of-xbox-controller-joysticks.jpg"                      alt="Close up of Xbox Controller joysticks"                ></p><p> Even on PC, some games are best played on a controller or gamepad. Fighting games, souls-likes, racing games, console-ported games, and a bunch more may benefit from controller use. Some Apex Legends players even prefer playing on a controller over a mouse and keyboard on PC.</p><p> If you’re a controller or gamepad player, you already know that your inputs go through that one device. This makes a good controller incredibly important, and the right one can depend on your play style and the games you play.</p><p> The top two most important things to have on a controller are a hall-effect analog stick and extra back buttons. A hall-effect sensor is less likely to have stick drift, which can lead to unnecessary analog stick movements when precision is what you need.</p><p> Stick drift can be annoying for racing games like Forza Motorsport or Gran Turismo, where having stick drift means you’ll need to increase your deadzone and reduce the usable input area. Having extra buttons will also make your ring and middle fingers more useful instead of using something like a claw grip, which can be strenuous on your hands.</p><h2 id="Good-Headphones-Hear-the-Right-Details"><a href="#Good-Headphones-Hear-the-Right-Details" class="headerlink" title="Good Headphones: Hear the Right Details"></a>Good Headphones: Hear the Right Details</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/sennheiser-hd599-se-on-brown-mousepad.JPG"                      alt="Sennheiser HD599 SE on brown mousepad"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> When it comes to headphones, we advise against any gaming-labeled ones.

Open-backs and IEMs are some of the best gaming options as they’re lightweight. Open-backs in particular can be worn for long sessions and don’t trap heat like closed-back headphones.</p><p> You don’t need special “gamer” sound tuning on your headphones. In fact, if the sound signature is relatively flat, you’ll be getting more accurate sound than bass-boosted gaming headphones.</p><h2 id="Gaming-Keyboards-Improve-Responsiveness"><a href="#Gaming-Keyboards-Improve-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Keyboards: Improve Responsiveness"></a>Gaming Keyboards: Improve Responsiveness</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/mouse-and-keyboard-angled-1.JPG"                      alt="mouse and keyboard angled"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975658">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975658">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975658%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975658/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> For most games, keyboards are often the least crucial piece of equipment. You’ll find that gamers just buy a mechanical keyboard and call it a day. However, there have been great gaming-focused innovations for keyboards, like super shallow actuation points and hall-effect analog sensors.</p><p> A good keyboard is essential for games that require millisecond precision for movement inputs. Hall-effect keyboards, on the other hand, are a beast of their own. While you can’t take advantage of analog inputs for every game, keyboards like the Wooting 60HE can give you controller movement while still having precise mouse aim.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Raise-Your-Skill-Ceiling-by-Having-the-Right-Gaming-Equipment"><a href="#Raise-Your-Skill-Ceiling-by-Having-the-Right-Gaming-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Raise Your Skill Ceiling by Having the Right Gaming Equipment"></a>Raise Your Skill Ceiling by Having the Right Gaming Equipment</h2><p> If you’ve been playing well with gaming gear that isn’t top-tier, imagine how much better you could be with the right gear.

Some say it’s too much, others don’t have or don’t want to fork out enough to cover the price of admission for 4K. But if you’re hoping to leap past 1080p resolution, it should be with 1440p.</p><p> Otherwise known as 2K, 1440p resolution is a great in-between. It may not be as sharp as 4K, but it’s exceedingly better than 1080p. There are more pixels to count and a much higher pixel density. More importantly, there are a plethora of options when it comes to 1440p monitors, from top-of-the-line premium specs to entry-level budget displays.</p><p>Here are the best 1440p gaming monitors available today.</p><ul><li><a class="link"

With its IPS panel, you have a wider range of mobility as far as monitor placement is concerned, which pairs nicely with the stand’s height and tilt adjustment. However, that’s a minor positive compared to this display’s performance.</p><p> Its 1440p resolution looks beautiful and sharp with the addition of HDR400 and 92 percent DCI-P3 color gamut. On the competitive side, its more impressive specification is the 170Hz refresh rate, alongside AMD FreeSync to keep screen tearing to a minimum.</p><p> Equally impressive is its 0.5ms MPRT response time, which helps reduce the overall effect of blurring. If you’re a competitive gamer that doesn’t want to splash all their cash on a monitor, this is a happy middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/asus-rog-swift-pg329q.jpg"                      alt="ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q"                ></p><p>Best Design</p><h5 id="ASUS-ROG-Swift-PG329Q-1"><a href="#ASUS-ROG-Swift-PG329Q-1" class="headerlink" title="ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q"></a>ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q</h5><p>A fine mix of performance and style</p><p> $256$399 Save $143</p><p> The ASUS ROG Swift PG329Q is a 1440p gaming monitor with a fast response time, G-Sync, and anti-blur technology.

Not only is it performance-heavy, but it hosts all the necessary gaming features kitted inside an attractive, 27-inch monitor.</p><p> Starting with refresh rate, you’ll get native 165Hz. What makes it even better is the addition of G-Sync and FreeSync, which allows for NVIDIA and AMD hardware to adjust the refresh rate as needed to keep your gaming experience buttery smooth. And that goes beautifully with its 1ms GTG response time.</p><p> On a side note, it’s very accommodating to gaming spaces. The stand can tilt, lower, raise, swivel, and pivot. It offers a thin bezel that will look great with any gaming setup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-odyssey-g7-series-1.jpg"                      alt="samsung-odyssey-g7-series-1"                ></p><p>Highest Refresh Rate</p><h5 id="Samsung-Odyssey-G7-LC27G75TQSNXZA-1"><a href="#Samsung-Odyssey-G7-LC27G75TQSNXZA-1" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Odyssey G7 LC27G75TQSNXZA"></a>Samsung Odyssey G7 LC27G75TQSNXZA</h5><p> When you want to push your hardware’s potential</p><p> $628$700 Save $72</p><p> The SAMSUNG Odyssey G7 is fitted with a myriad of gaming features, such as G-Sync compatibility, 1ms response time, a curved display, 240Hz refresh rate, and FreeSync technology.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Impressive 240Hz refresh rate</li><li>Can reduce screen tearing with G-Sync and FreeSync</li><li>Quantum Dot technology gives very good contrast</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Curved screen must be a preference</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HJ4VQK?tag=makeusw-20&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2002430&asc_refurl=https://www.makeuseof.com/best-1440p-gaming-monitors/&asc_campaign=Affiliate" >$628 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-odyssey-g7-27-led-curved-qhd-freesync-and-g-sync-compatible-monitor-with-hdr-displayport-hdmi-black/6404863.p?skuId=6404863" >$700 at Best Buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Not everyone is into having a curved monitor like the Samsung Odyssey G7 Series LC27G75TQSNXZA, but no one can argue the added value of immersion. In the case of the G7, it’s only one more item on its long list of delicious premium features. And it isn’t obnoxious with its “gamer” aesthetic.</p><p> Performance-wise, the Samsung Odyssey G7 isn’t pulling punches. If you have the hardware to pull it off, you can reach a native 240Hz. To handle any screen tearing or blurring, Samsung went ahead and added G-Sync and FreeSync technology. Couple that with its 1ms response time and you’ll never feel like you’re lagging behind. To sweeten the deal, it also comes with HDR 600.</p><p> Contrast and colors are enhanced to further improve the look of your games allowing for a truly immersive gaming experience.

You focus on color, and the Alienware AW3423DW has no shortage of color.</p><p> If you’re a color snob, the Alienware AW3423DW’s quantum dot display will certainly impress. You’re bringing rich, cinematic colors to your games, along with a contrast ratio that looks truly black without sucking detail out or causing vibrant colors to bloom.</p><p> The Alienware AW3423DW takes up a lot of desk real estate, though you do have the option to adjust height, tilt, and swivel. That’s great and all, but something like this should be mounted. Thankfully, the monitor supports VESA wall mounts—in fact, it’s packaged with one, taking out all the guesswork on finding the right mount.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dell-S2722DGM.jpg"                      alt="Dell S2722DGM"                ></p><p>Best Multi-Purpose</p><h5 id="Dell-S2722DGM-1"><a href="#Dell-S2722DGM-1" class="headerlink" title="Dell S2722DGM"></a>Dell S2722DGM</h5><p> A suitable option for working and gaming</p><p> $236$300 Save $64</p><p> The Dell S2722DGM strikes the perfect balance between work and play.

While it’ll impress you with its colors, it’ll be just as impressive for when you’re ready to relax with your favorite videogame.</p><p> Starting with its beautiful color expression, the Dell S2722DGM covers 99% of the sRGB color gamut, which pairs wonderfully with its 3000:1 contrast ratio. In other words, colors are going to really pop, especially when a scene features dark shadows.</p><p> When it’s time to game, you’re going to love its surprisingly fast response time of 1ms, which is well within range for competitive play. Most importantly, its refresh rate is an impressive 165Hz if you use the DisplayPort. If you opt to use HDMI, it’s slightly lower at 144Hz, which is still great!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pixio-pxc277-advanced.jpg"                      alt="Pixio PXC277 Advanced"                ></p><p>Budget Curved</p><h5 id="Pixio-PXC277-Advanced-1"><a href="#Pixio-PXC277-Advanced-1" class="headerlink" title="Pixio PXC277 Advanced"></a>Pixio PXC277 Advanced</h5><p> No-nonsense monitor with a curve and adaptive sync</p><p> $240$300 Save $60</p><p> The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Monitor is perfectly sized, curved, and supports adaptive sync for stable frame transitioning.

The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Curved Monitor sets things right, and it comes with a suite of gaming features, too!</p><p> First off, the Pixio PXC277’s screen measures 27 inches, which is a great sweet spot for a 1440p resolution since it doesn’t stretch the pixels past their limit. If that’s not quite big enough, there’s a 32-inch option that still retains the sharpness of its resolution and curvature.</p><p> It’s not all curves and resolution, though. The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Monitor boasts adaptive sync that works for both AMD and GPU graphics cards to ensure your framerate stays buttery smooth while you’re gaming.</p><p> The Pixio PXC277 Advanced Monitor is a shortcut to a large, curved display with 1440p resolution.</p><h2 id="Picking-the-Best-1440p-Gaming-Monitor-For-You"><a href="#Picking-the-Best-1440p-Gaming-Monitor-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Picking the Best 1440p Gaming Monitor For You"></a>Picking the Best 1440p Gaming Monitor For You</h2><p> With resolution already accounted for, finding the right 1440p gaming monitor comes down to refresh rate, response time, and VRR technology, like FreeSync (AMD) and G-Sync (NVIDIA). All three work together to make gameplay feel exponentially smoother and can mean the difference between life and death and competitive games.</p><p> The GIGABYTE M27Q his the trifecta: an incredibly fast response time, a high refresh rate of 170Hz, and VRR availability for both AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards. With an IPS display to boot, you’ll be able to kick back and relax with your favorite videogame without losing picture quality.</p><p> However, if you want the quickest route to 1440p gaming, the Acer V277U is a superb second option. Its display is a healthy 27 inches, which combines really well with the resolution. More importantly, it has a 75Hz refresh rate and adaptive sync technology to smooth frame transitioning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GIGABYTE-M27Q.jpg"                      alt="GIGABYTE-M27Q"                ></p><p>Best Overall</p><h5 id="GIGABYTE-M27Q-2"><a href="#GIGABYTE-M27Q-2" class="headerlink" title="GIGABYTE M27Q"></a>GIGABYTE M27Q</h5><p> Well-rounded monitor with a high refresh rate</p><p> $250$300 Save $50</p><p> The GIGABYTE M27Q embodies all the right features for gaming.

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives. Instead of adding external storage, you can add another SSD to your PS5 using the built-in and empty SSD slot, which should help alleviate any performance issues. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-drive/"><strong>The best PS5 external hard drives for storing all your games</strong></a></p><p>Below I’ll walk you through what you’ll need and the steps you’ll take to install an SSD in your PlayStation, expanding your gaming storage. </p><h2 id="How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5"><a href="#How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5" class="headerlink" title="How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5"></a>How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5</h2><p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> To add additional storage to your PlayStation 5 using the built-in SSD slot, you’ll need some supplies. </p><p>You’ll, of course, need an SSD. There’s a certain type of SSD that Sony requires. More specifically, you’ll need a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD with a heatsink. That’s a lot of jargon, I know. But the good news is, pretty much every company that makes SSDs has an SSD that’ll work with and is advertised for the PS5. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-games/"><strong>The best PS5 games</strong></a></p><p>I used a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P2T0CW/dp/B09JHKSNNG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C35c5e9a9-34c0-4827-9f6b-00a31f898678%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung 980 Pro with Heatsink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that meets all of Sony’s requirements and comes in various storage capacities. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy an SSD that has a heatsink already attached, you can buy a third-party option. There are a few listed on Amazon, but I haven’t tested any of them myself. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-cool-your-raspberry-pi/"><strong>How to cool your Raspberry Pi (and should you?)</strong></a></p><p>Finally, you’ll need a #1 Phillips head screwdriver.

Remove the back cover"></a>1. Remove the back cover</h2><p>Before you begin, power off the PS5 and unplug the power cable, HDMI, and anything else connected to it. Lay the console on a table, with the front of the console (it’s the side with the PS logo) facing down, and the rear of the console towards you. I put mine on top of a desk mat to prevent scratches on the case. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-headset/"><strong>The best PS5 headsets you can buy</strong></a></p><p>To gain access to the SSD slot, you’ll need to remove the back cover. If you have it positioned face down and the back of the console facing you, lift up on the front right corner and slide to the left. Once it’s off, set the panel to the side. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover"><a href="#2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the expansion slot cover"></a>2. Remove the expansion slot cover</h2><p>There’s not a whole lot to look at with the panel removed from the PS5. There’s a fan, a lot of black, and then the expansion slot cover near the top of the housing. I rotated the PS5 so that the SSD slot was closer to me and easier to work on. </p><p>There’s a single screw holding the cover in place; remove it and set it aside in a safe place. Optional step: Take a few seconds to appreciate the PlayStation button icons on the head of the screw. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h2 id="3-Move-the-screw-and-spacer-inside-the-SSD-housing"><a href="#3-Move-the-screw-and-spacer-inside-the-SSD-housing" class="headerlink" title="3.

Move the screw and spacer inside the SSD housing</h2><p>With the expansion slot cover removed, locate and remove the screw and spacer near the end of the SSD housing. </p><p>There are various holes inside the SSD housing that correspond with the various lengths of SSD cards. I held my SSD inside the housing to figure out which hole lined up with the end of it. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-ssd/"><strong>The best gaming SSDs for PC, Xbox, and PS5</strong></a></p><p>I then placed the spacer over the hole – it’s held in place by three dots, so don’t worry about perfectly lining it up or keeping it in place. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938677/19272" target="_top" id="1938677">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938677" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938677/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Insert-the-SSD-and-use-the-mounting-screw"><a href="#4-Insert-the-SSD-and-use-the-mounting-screw" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, if you’re repurposing an SSD from a PC and it has important files on it, you’ll want to transfer them off before formatting the drive. </p><p>Once it’s formatted, you can move games between the internal SSD and your newly installed expanded storage.</p><p>That wasn’t so bad now, was it? </p><h4 id="More-how-tos"><a href="#More-how-tos" class="headerlink" title="More how-tos"></a>More how-tos</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-download-youtube-videos-for-free-plus-two-other-methods/"  title="How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods">How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wi-fi-problems-how-to-add-a-wired-network-to-your-home-without-ethernet-cable/"  title="Wi-Fi problems?

View at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Right out of the box, this is just a good-looking TV. It has a very slim design and a super-thin bezel that truly makes the picture stand out. As I was unboxing it, the stand also caught my eye. Instead of two legs like almost all other TVs, the QN90C is supported by a single leg in the middle, similar to a computer monitor. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-samsung-tv/" >The best Samsung TVs of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Though I must admit, setting up that stand was a little cumbersome, so much so that after I read the manual and started putting it together, I had to refer back to the instructions because I couldn’t figure it out. I’d consider that a small inconvenience, though, as it’s a “one-and-done” type of thing. I feel like the sleek, premium look was eventually worth it. The stand did have a slight wobble, especially when my kids ran through the living room, but I was never worried about the set toppling over. </p><p>If inputs are a concern, the QN90C has four HDMI ports (one eARC), all of which support HDMI 2.1.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the ports on the back.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The set uses Samsung’s own Tizen software as an operating system. This was my first experience with Tizen, and while it wasn’t as user-friendly as Roku or Google TV, I could navigate where I wanted to go without much trouble. </p><p>On the display side, this is a Quantum Mini-LED, which Samsung first introduced in 2021. As the name implies, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/neo-qled-vs-oled-which-technology-is-right-for-you/" >the LEDs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are much smaller here than usual, leading to better backlight control. However, Samsung claims to take that a step further with microlayers inside the LEDs that eliminate noise.</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Recommends</p><p>ZDNET saves you time and money by delivering the best products and tech deals to your inbox every week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There’s support for HDR10 and HDR10+, and online reports put the brightness at nearly 2,000 nits – meaning it’s bright enough for most home and office environments.</p><p>My living room has a fair amount of natural light shining where my TV sits, and this set’s display thrives in that environment, largely due to its anti-reflection film. There are times with my everyday television that I have to close my blinds because of glare, but the QN90C was bright enough to make that unnecessary. I fired up a personal favorite, Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things,</em> to test the display, and it was the most I’ve enjoyed that show visually. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/lg-vs-samsung-tv-which-brand-should-you-buy-in-2024/" >LG vs Samsung TV: Which brand should you buy in 2024? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The QN90C also utilizes local dimming control, which takes unused electrical power from dark areas of the screen and diverts it to brighter areas. I was impressed with how that worked here. Dark scenes were dark as intended, but black levels still had a contrast where things were clearly visible. Bright colors popped beautifully, and scenes with fast action showed no signs of blur. </p><p>Samsung has its Neural Quantum Processor on board for upscaling content. This uses AI to add depth and sharpness to content regardless of the original resolution—essentially making everything 4K. I tested this out with <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> and loved how things looked. I’ve had televisions where the upscaling produced far too unnatural-looking results, but the QN90C does this very well.</p><p>Artie Beaty&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>When it comes to sound, this set is plenty sufficient as-is. It supports Dolby Atmos, but even without a <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-sound-system/" >sound bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, I could hear dialogue clearly over the bustle of my two kids and dog. I keep closed captions on my everyday TV for this very reason, even when using a sound bar, and it was nice to be able to turn that off for a while.</p><p>Like other <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-samsung-tv/" >Samsung televisions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it supports object tracking, which sends sounds to the relevant part of the screen. For example, if you’re watching a movie with a racing scene, you’ll audibly notice the engine sound roar left to right along with the car.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/samsung-has-its-own-line-of-video-game-controllers-now-heres-the-first-model/" >Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here’s the first model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>When I started digging into the gaming features, though, I found where this television <em>really</em> shined. It has a very low input lag (under 10ms), a 120Hz display, support for variable refresh rate, and Samsung’s above-average Game Bar feature. </p><p>Holding the pause&#x2F;play button while a video game console is on brings up the menu overlay. From there, you can dig into settings like Game Picture Mode (there are six to choose from, plus two custom options), Game Motion Plus (which reduces motion blur and improves picture quality), and an on-screen crosshair (with three color options).</p><p>From that bar, there’s a deeper game mode settings option, which lets you tune the black equalizer, choose “basic” or “advanced” for HDR, and even choose the level of judder reduction and blur reduction. </p><p>Most casual gamers wouldn’t dive this deep into these settings, but this is a fantastic thing to have for serious gamers. It’s the deepest level of customization I’ve seen from a gaming menu. I’d call this easily one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-tv/" >best gaming TVs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I’ve come across. </p><h2 id="ZDNET’s-buying-advice"><a href="#ZDNET’s-buying-advice" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET’s buying advice"></a>ZDNET’s buying advice</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Anti-Glare-Q-Symphony-QN55QN90C/dp/B0BTTVBDVD?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ca809cba9-2efa-4131-bfb0-67fc93c07357%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung QN90C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> TV has a few minor annoyances – I’m hesitant to call the wobbliness and installation process shortcomings – but its picture quality in every instance and gaming features more than made up for those.

Helldivers 2, a game by Arrowhead Game Studios, exploded in popularity on PC and PS5 consoles in 2024. How can a future multiplayer game replicate Arrowhead’s success? Here are some key things I’ve noticed as a player that contribute to the game’s success.</p><h2 id="1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play"><a href="#1-Allow-Cross-Platform-Multiplayer-Play" class="headerlink" title="1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play"></a>1 Allow Cross-Platform Multiplayer Play</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0416461.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Super Earth public service announcement"                ></p><p> Helldivers 2 is a third-person shooter live service game where players become Helldivers fighting for Super Earth. Players join teammates in missions on different planets across the universe to eradicate Terminids (bug-like alien life forms) and Automatons (robots). Helldivers harvest valuable resources from planets that are home to Terminids and Automatons.</p><p> Gamers can play Helldivers 2 on the PlayStation 5 and PC. One of the keys to a successful multiplayer game is ensuring that even if your friend has a PC, but you only have a PlayStation, you’ll still be able to join each other in the interplanetary fight for democracy in Helldivers 2.</p><p> Cross-platform multiplayer features allow people to play games with friends who may use different platforms and maintain social connections while increasing the overall player pool.

This created an uproar across the Helldivers 2 player base, which caused Sony to backtrack on its decision only two days later.</p><p> This outcry resulted in more than 150,000 negative reviews on the<a class="link"   href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS%5F2/#app%5Freviews%5Fhash" >Helldivers 2 Steam page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (with some reviews reversed after the policy change). Despite Sony backtracking on this decision, Helldivers 2 is still currently delisted in countries that do not have access to PSN accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415451.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Warbond menu"                ></p><p> The game was faced with alienating a large portion of its player base, but its willingness to reverse its decision got it back on track.</p><h2 id="3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence"><a href="#3-Have-A-Strong-Social-Media-Presence" class="headerlink" title="3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence"></a>3 Have A Strong Social Media Presence</h2><p> The Helldivers 2 social media pages post frequent game updates, challenges, and memes that earn impressive engagement. For instance, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/helldivers2game/?hl=en" >Helldivers 2 Instagram page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> boasts over 100,000 followers.</p><p> Helldivers 2 also has a<a class="link"   href="https://discord.com/invite/zbbZ5rNcuK" >Discord server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with almost 1 million members, where players receive updates from the game’s developers. During the Sony PSN linking debacle, development leads updated the game’s player base amid ongoing negotiations with Sony.</p><h2 id="4-Offer-Community-Challenges"><a href="#4-Offer-Community-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="4 Offer Community Challenges"></a>4 Offer Community Challenges</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415472.jpg"                      alt="Screenshot of Major Order in Helldivers 2"                ></p><p> Helldivers 2 also succeeded in creating a sense of community through weekly challenges known as Major Orders. One recent Major Order required the game’s player base to kill 2 million Terminids to receive in-game currency called medals.</p><p> The game’s developers put out new Major Orders every week to engage the community. The community is not guaranteed to pass each Major Order, making it a challenge for the entire player base. Each mission in Helldivers 2 that a player participates in adds to the progress of the Major Order, making the success of the mission entirely based on community progress.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System"><a href="#5-Have-a-Free-Progression-System" class="headerlink" title="5 Have a Free Progression System"></a>5 Have a Free Progression System</h2><p> There are multiple forms of in-game currency in Helldivers 2 which players can find in missions for free. If a player is looking to fast-track unlocking items available in Warbonds (battle passes), weapons, and other cosmetics, there are paid options, as well. Importantly, a player does not have to pay to advance in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415430.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Acquisition Center"                ></p><p> Players can find Super Credits, which unlock new monthly Warbonds and cosmetics, across missions at random points on the map. Super Credits are also available for purchase in the game store. Medals can be obtained by completing Major Orders or finding stashes during missions. You can also earn medals by completing missions. The higher the difficulty level of the mission, the more medals players unlock upon completion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/share_20240524_0415072.jpeg"                      alt="Screenshot of Helldivers 2 Super Credits store"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135367/19272" target="_top" id="2135367">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135367" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135367/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> There are also samples scattered across each mission depending on the difficulty level.

Manual Ejection Steps Revealed"></a>Series X Disc Trouble? Manual Ejection Steps Revealed</h2><p> If your Xbox Series X won’t eject a disc, you may see cause to panic. However, even if you can’t eject a disc using the software of your Xbox or by pressing the button on your console, you can still manually retrieve your stuck disc. Let’s take a look.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Manually-Eject-Your-Xbox-Disc-Using-the-Hidden-Eject-Hole"><a href="#Manually-Eject-Your-Xbox-Disc-Using-the-Hidden-Eject-Hole" class="headerlink" title="Manually Eject Your Xbox Disc Using the Hidden Eject Hole"></a>Manually Eject Your Xbox Disc Using the Hidden Eject Hole</h2><p> Having to force a disc out of your gaming console is never ideal, and manually removing a disc from your Xbox Series X is seen as a last resort by Xbox. However, doing so on Xbox Series X is relatively simple and relies on locating a hidden hole at the base of your console.</p><p> To safely access the disc, Xbox suggests utilizing an uncoiled paperclip to access the<strong>Eject Hole</strong> . To remove an Xbox disc from your Xbox Series X manually, ensure you have a paper clip at hand and follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Uncoil your paper clip so that one side is about two inches long and thin enough to fit through a small hole.</li><li>Ensure your Xbox Series X is powered down by unplugging your console from the mains.</li><li>Rest your Xbox on its side, so that you can view your console’s base.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/img20231106101548.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of an Xbox Series X resting on its side"                ></p><ul><li>Adjacent to the disc drive and along the stand at the console’s base, you should be able to see a small<strong>Eject hole</strong> .</li><li>To manually eject a stuck disc from your Xbox Series X, insert the long end of the paper clip into the<strong>Eject hole</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cdbf6aa7-a452-4087-862e-41da990d5801.jpg"                      alt="An official image of the location of the Eject Hole on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/help/hardware-network/console/manually-eject-disc" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> After a few seconds of inserting the paper clip, the mechanism holding the disc inside your Xbox Series X should manually release, freeing your stuck disc.

After all, utilizing the<strong>Eject hole</strong> may retrieve your stuck disc, but it doesn’t rectify the issue causing your discs to get stuck.</p><p> For this reason, Xbox provides a few key points about dealing with stuck Xbox discs that may prevent you from dealing with the problem again. To be specific, these points can be defined by the following:</p><ul><li>Xbox highlights that a stuck disc in an Xbox Series X may be fixed by simply<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reset-xbox-one-xbox-360/" >resetting your Xbox console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If discs continue to get stuck, you may want to reset your Xbox, instead of utilizing the<strong>Eject hole</strong> .</li><li>Xbox also points out that while the<strong>Eject button</strong> on your console may not retrieve your disc, utilizing your controller could. To do this, from the Home screen of your console, press the<strong>X button</strong> to<strong>Eject</strong> your disc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3183.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Home screen option to Eject a disc from an Xbox Series X"                ></p><ul><li>If you continually rely on the<strong>Eject hole</strong> to release a disc, it is likely your console has a hardware problem. To permanently fix this, it’s recommended you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-broken-xbox-series-xs-and-send-for-a-repair/" >send your Xbox Series X in for a repair <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li></ul><p> But even with these pointers from Xbox regarding how to avoid relying on the<strong>Eject hole</strong> , you can always rely on the manual method to retrieve any disc that may be stuck inside your Series X.</p><h2 id="Ensure-You-Can-Always-Retrieve-Discs-From-Your-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Ensure-You-Can-Always-Retrieve-Discs-From-Your-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Ensure You Can Always Retrieve Discs From Your Xbox Series X"></a>Ensure You Can Always Retrieve Discs From Your Xbox Series X</h2><p> With a consistent and reliable method of manually retrieving stuck Xbox discs inside your Series X, you can rest easy and should always be able to retrieve discs from your console.</p><p> And with further advice from Xbox, you may even be able to rectify the overall issue affecting your Xbox Series X in the first place.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-premier-guidelines-for-broadcasting-sports-online-for-2024/"><u>[New] Premier Guidelines for Broadcasting Sports Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-amazon-prime-and-twitter-most-shared-and-liked-shows-23/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Amazon Prime and Twitter Most Shared & Liked Shows, '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/exploring-anchors-innovative-ai-a-guide-to-using-the-updated-claude-3-system/"><u>Exploring Anchor's Innovative AI: A Guide to Using the Updated Claude 3 System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/frp-hijacker-by-hagard-download-and-bypass-your-nokia-g310-frp-locks-by-drfone-android/"><u>FRP Hijacker by Hagard Download and Bypass your Nokia G310 FRP Locks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/glossi-guide-stream-xbox-game-pass-via-steam-connection/"><u>GlosSI Guide: Stream Xbox Game Pass via Steam Connection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/identify-malfunctioning-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11107-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>Identify malfunctioning hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11/10/7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-launch-your-live-stream-a-comprehensive-beginners-manual/"><u>In 2024, Launch Your Live Stream A Comprehensive Beginner's Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/minecraft-realms-unplugged-retrieve-your-landscapes/"><u>Minecraft Realms Unplugged: Retrieve Your Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/palworld-unveiled-your-complete-guide/"><u>PalWorld Unveiled: Your Complete Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/selecting-the-right-cpu-cooler-focus-on-these-8-elements/"><u>Selecting the Right CPU Cooler: Focus on These 8 Elements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-positive-effects-of-game-release-postponements/"><u>The Positive Effects of Game Release Postponements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/top-picks-best-free-films-on-youtube-july-2024-edition/"><u>Top Picks: Best Free Films on YouTube - July 2024 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/top-rated-key-tracking-devices-finding-the-perfect-one/"><u>Top-Rated Key Tracking Devices : Finding the Perfect One</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-the-stubborn-error-403-in-roblox-on-your-computer/"><u>Troubleshooting the Stubborn Error 403 in Roblox on Your Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/wireless-woes-fixed-with-switch-tips/"><u>Wireless Woes, Fixed with Switch Tips</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives. Instead of adding external storage, you can add another SSD to your PS5 using the built-in and empty SSD slot, which should help alleviate any performance issues. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-drive/"><strong>The best PS5 external hard drives for storing all your games</strong></a></p><p>Below I’ll walk you through what you’ll need and the steps you’ll take to install an SSD in your PlayStation, expanding your gaming storage. </p><h2 id="How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5"><a href="#How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5" class="headerlink" title="How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5"></a>How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5</h2><p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> To add additional storage to your PlayStation 5 using the built-in SSD slot, you’ll need some supplies. </p><p>You’ll, of course, need an SSD. There’s a certain type of SSD that Sony requires. More specifically, you’ll need a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD with a heatsink. That’s a lot of jargon, I know. But the good news is, pretty much every company that makes SSDs has an SSD that’ll work with and is advertised for the PS5. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-games/"><strong>The best PS5 games</strong></a></p><p>I used a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P2T0CW/dp/B09JHKSNNG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C35c5e9a9-34c0-4827-9f6b-00a31f898678%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung 980 Pro with Heatsink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that meets all of Sony’s requirements and comes in various storage capacities. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy an SSD that has a heatsink already attached, you can buy a third-party option. There are a few listed on Amazon, but I haven’t tested any of them myself. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-cool-your-raspberry-pi/"><strong>How to cool your Raspberry Pi (and should you?)</strong></a></p><p>Finally, you’ll need a #1 Phillips head screwdriver.

Remove the back cover"></a>1. Remove the back cover</h2><p>Before you begin, power off the PS5 and unplug the power cable, HDMI, and anything else connected to it. Lay the console on a table, with the front of the console (it’s the side with the PS logo) facing down, and the rear of the console towards you. I put mine on top of a desk mat to prevent scratches on the case. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-headset/"><strong>The best PS5 headsets you can buy</strong></a></p><p>To gain access to the SSD slot, you’ll need to remove the back cover. If you have it positioned face down and the back of the console facing you, lift up on the front right corner and slide to the left. Once it’s off, set the panel to the side. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover"><a href="#2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the expansion slot cover"></a>2. Remove the expansion slot cover</h2><p>There’s not a whole lot to look at with the panel removed from the PS5.

The LEDs are extremely efficient at converting energy to light rather than heat. Estimates suggest that the average LED strip light consumes as little as 10 to 20 watts per hour.</p><h3 id="Q-How-do-I-connect-LED-strip-lights"><a href="#Q-How-do-I-connect-LED-strip-lights" class="headerlink" title="Q: How do I connect LED strip lights?"></a>Q: How do I connect LED strip lights?</h3><p> Most LED strip lights feature easy-to-use connectors. One connector will feature a socket, while the other will feature a prong. Before connecting the two strips, you should attach the socket to the wall while leaving a minimal amount of slack. By connecting the prong to the socket when it is already mounted, you will ensure that your LED strip light is perfectly positioned.</p><h3 id="Q-Is-it-alright-to-leave-LED-strip-lights-on-all-night"><a href="#Q-Is-it-alright-to-leave-LED-strip-lights-on-all-night" class="headerlink" title="Q: Is it alright to leave LED strip lights on all night?"></a>Q: Is it alright to leave LED strip lights on all night?</h3><p> It’s okay to leave reputable LED strip lights on all night. LED light strips generally draw little power and produce little heat, as they’re produced to run constantly without overheating. Some poorly constructed LED light strips may get hot when allowed to run for long periods of time, in which case turning them off overnight (or replacing them) is ideal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094483/7443" target="_top" id="2094483">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094483" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094483/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Q-Do-LED-strip-lights-get-hot"><a href="#Q-Do-LED-strip-lights-get-hot" class="headerlink" title="Q: Do LED strip lights get hot?"></a>Q: Do LED strip lights get hot?</h3><p> LED strip lights don’t get significantly warmer than the ambient room temperature when allowed to run for long periods of time. LED lights are far more efficient at turning energy into light than incandescent lights. As a result, it’s uncommon for LED strip lights to get hotter than 122°F.</p><h3 id="Q-Can-I-put-LED-strip-lights-on-wood"><a href="#Q-Can-I-put-LED-strip-lights-on-wood" class="headerlink" title="Q: Can I put LED strip lights on wood?"></a>Q: Can I put LED strip lights on wood?</h3><p> You can put LED strip lights on wood, but the sticky side of LED light strips doesn’t adhere well to wood. You should use a stronger adhesive or light strip mounts to ensure that the light strip doesn’t fall down. LEDs generally don’t run hot enough to present a serious fire hazard, and if you’re concerned, you can use a timer to force the LEDs to occasionally turn off and cool down.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/1726219888474-mp4movavi/"><u>動画加工におけるMP4ファイル改良「Movavi」を使った詳しいガイド</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/achieve-more-money-from-your-short-videos-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Achieve More Money From Your Short Videos on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-exclusive.techidaily.com/como-optimizar-la-conversion-de-video-de-webm-a-mp4-premium-en-sistemas-windows-11macos/"><u>Cómo Optimizar La Conversión De Video: De WebM a MP4 Premium en Sistemas Windows 11/macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/effortless-ft2ft232rusbuartdriver-quick-access-and-download-now/"><u>Effortless FT2#FT232R_USB_UART_Driver: Quick Access & Download Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-the-impact-of-keyboard-refresh-rate/"><u>Exploring the Impact of Keyboard Refresh Rate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/get-the-newest-epson-xp-310-software-updates-online/"><u>Get the Newest Epson XP 310 Software Updates Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/1722974594665-improve-gaming-experience-with-new-updates-on-amd-rx-amoledr-480-drivers/"><u>Improve Gaming Experience with New Updates on AMD RX Amoled(R) 480 Drivers!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-expertly-use-vscos-adjustment-brushes/"><u>In 2024, How to Expertly Use VSCO's Adjustment Brushes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-turn-off-find-my-iphone-8-when-phone-is-broken-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Turn Off Find My iPhone 8 when Phone is Broken? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/open-doors-open-worlds-no-more-game-restrictions/"><u>Open Doors, Open Worlds: No More Game Restrictions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/swift-storage-switcheroo-clone-and-upgrade-your-deck-now/"><u>Swift Storage Switcheroo: Clone & Upgrade Your Deck Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-10-methods-to-maximize-docked-steam-deck-output/"><u>Top 10 Methods to Maximize Docked Steam Deck Output</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As game installation sizes continue to increase, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll fill up the internal PS5 storage and be left with the decision of deleting a game or adding more space. </p><p>You can add external storage via a USB port on the console, but you’re going to run into performance hiccups due to the speed of the connection and drives. Instead of adding external storage, you can add another SSD to your PS5 using the built-in and empty SSD slot, which should help alleviate any performance issues. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-drive/"><strong>The best PS5 external hard drives for storing all your games</strong></a></p><p>Below I’ll walk you through what you’ll need and the steps you’ll take to install an SSD in your PlayStation, expanding your gaming storage. </p><h2 id="How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5"><a href="#How-to-install-an-SSD-in-a-PlayStation-5" class="headerlink" title="How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5"></a>How to install an SSD in a PlayStation 5</h2><p><strong>What you’ll need:</strong> To add additional storage to your PlayStation 5 using the built-in SSD slot, you’ll need some supplies. </p><p>You’ll, of course, need an SSD. There’s a certain type of SSD that Sony requires. More specifically, you’ll need a PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD with a heatsink. That’s a lot of jargon, I know. But the good news is, pretty much every company that makes SSDs has an SSD that’ll work with and is advertised for the PS5. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-games/"><strong>The best PS5 games</strong></a></p><p>I used a <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Electronics-Heatsink-Internal-Compatible-MZ-V8P2T0CW/dp/B09JHKSNNG?th=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C35c5e9a9-34c0-4827-9f6b-00a31f898678%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Samsung 980 Pro with Heatsink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that meets all of Sony’s requirements and comes in various storage capacities. </p><p>If you don’t want to buy an SSD that has a heatsink already attached, you can buy a third-party option. There are a few listed on Amazon, but I haven’t tested any of them myself. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-cool-your-raspberry-pi/"><strong>How to cool your Raspberry Pi (and should you?)</strong></a></p><p>Finally, you’ll need a #1 Phillips head screwdriver.

Remove the back cover"></a>1. Remove the back cover</h2><p>Before you begin, power off the PS5 and unplug the power cable, HDMI, and anything else connected to it. Lay the console on a table, with the front of the console (it’s the side with the PS logo) facing down, and the rear of the console towards you. I put mine on top of a desk mat to prevent scratches on the case. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-ps5-headset/"><strong>The best PS5 headsets you can buy</strong></a></p><p>To gain access to the SSD slot, you’ll need to remove the back cover. If you have it positioned face down and the back of the console facing you, lift up on the front right corner and slide to the left. Once it’s off, set the panel to the side. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover"><a href="#2-Remove-the-expansion-slot-cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the expansion slot cover"></a>2. Remove the expansion slot cover</h2><p>There’s not a whole lot to look at with the panel removed from the PS5. There’s a fan, a lot of black, and then the expansion slot cover near the top of the housing. I rotated the PS5 so that the SSD slot was closer to me and easier to work on. </p><p>There’s a single screw holding the cover in place; remove it and set it aside in a safe place. Optional step: Take a few seconds to appreciate the PlayStation button icons on the head of the screw. </p><p>Jason Cipriani&#x2F;ZDNET</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Move-the-screw-and-spacer-inside-the-SSD-housing"><a href="#3-Move-the-screw-and-spacer-inside-the-SSD-housing" class="headerlink" title="3.

Move the screw and spacer inside the SSD housing</h2><p>With the expansion slot cover removed, locate and remove the screw and spacer near the end of the SSD housing. </p><p>There are various holes inside the SSD housing that correspond with the various lengths of SSD cards.

However, if you’re repurposing an SSD from a PC and it has important files on it, you’ll want to transfer them off before formatting the drive. </p><p>Once it’s formatted, you can move games between the internal SSD and your newly installed expanded storage.</p><p>That wasn’t so bad now, was it? </p><h4 id="More-how-tos"><a href="#More-how-tos" class="headerlink" title="More how-tos"></a>More how-tos</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-download-youtube-videos-for-free-plus-two-other-methods/"  title="How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods">How to download YouTube videos for free, plus two other methods <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wi-fi-problems-how-to-add-a-wired-network-to-your-home-without-ethernet-cable/"  title="Wi-Fi problems?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Debunking-Display-Desires-Why-You-Don’t-Need-an-HDR-Panel"><a href="#Debunking-Display-Desires-Why-You-Don’t-Need-an-HDR-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Debunking Display Desires: Why You Don’t Need an HDR Panel"></a>Debunking Display Desires: Why You Don’t Need an HDR Panel</h2><p> PC Gaming is all about optimal performance, customization, and graphical fidelity. If you can afford high-end hardware for the best experience possible, then a high refresh rate HDR monitor seems like the obvious choice. Unfortunately, the HDR experience on PC is vastly different from the one that you’d get on consoles.</p><p> Due to limited monitor options, subpar optimization, and high costs, HDR gaming on PC won’t quite meet your expectations. With the right display and the right game, it can look great, but here are a few reasons why HDR is likely not worth the hassle.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Limited-Monitor-Options"><a href="#1-Limited-Monitor-Options" class="headerlink" title="1. Limited Monitor Options"></a>1. Limited Monitor Options</h2><p> You have a lot of options to pick from<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/gaming-monitor-buying-tips/" >when you’re shopping around for a new monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . However, once you decide that you need a monitor with HDR, your options start to get very limited. True HDR requires a high contrast ratio (10,000:1 or higher), 1,000 nits of peak brightness, and support for a wide color gamut.</p><p> There are lots of HDR-ready monitors on the market, but only a select few meet the minimum requirements we just discussed. If you live in a region where buying high-end hardware is difficult, you’ll have a tough time getting your hands on a true HDR monitor that delivers the experience you’re expecting.</p><p> Of course, there are a few monitors that perform admirably for HDR gaming, but you might end up paying even more than your entire PC in some cases.</p><h2 id="2-The-HDR400-Trap"><a href="#2-The-HDR400-Trap" class="headerlink" title="2. The HDR400 Trap"></a>2. The HDR400 Trap</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dual-monitors-desk-set-up-for-visual-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Dual monitors desk set up for visual comparison."                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-not-enjoying-true-hdr/" >If you bought an HDR monitor and aren’t enjoying the experience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then you’ve likely fallen into the HDR400 trap. True HDR (HDR10) monitors require at least 1,000 nits of peak brightness, but you can find plenty of monitors that feature an HDR400 certification. If the monitor has a wide color gamut, you will get better color reproduction and better highlights in brighter scenes with HDR400.</p><p> However, HDR400 monitors fall flat when compared to true HDR10 monitors. This is because HDR400 monitors don’t call for local dimming, a feature that dims the backlight to improve the depth of blacks.</p><p> Since HDR400 monitors lack this feature, they rely on maxing the backlight to achieve that HDR look. This causes blacks to become grayish, and the issue is particularly bad with IPS monitors. You don’t get the improvements in contrast either. With some games, a well-calibrated SDR (standard dynamic range) monitor is better than an HDR one.</p><h2 id="3-The-Metadata-Problem"><a href="#3-The-Metadata-Problem" class="headerlink" title="3. The Metadata Problem"></a>3. The Metadata Problem</h2><p> Even when monitors have 1,000 nits of peak brightness and feature support for HDR10, the problems don’t stop there. HDR10 uses static metadata, which means that colors and brightness need to be fixed at the start of the game. This means that everything is calibrated once at the start, and doing so properly is not easy for game developers.</p><p> In contrast, monitors that have support for dynamic metadata or HDR10+ fare better. With dynamic metadata, you get dynamic brightness and colors on a frame-by-frame basis. This is why games with HDR support can look great on certain monitors but bad on others. There’s no universal or consistent experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130874/7443" target="_top" id="2130874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-You’ll-Spend-More-Time-Tweaking-In-Game-Settings"><a href="#4-You’ll-Spend-More-Time-Tweaking-In-Game-Settings" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, it can quickly turn into a source of frustration when it doesn’t work. You might end up spending a lot of time within game menus, playing around with lighting and other graphical settings.</p><p> Outside of gaming, Windows has its fair share of bugs when it comes to using HDR monitors. There are color rendering issues with certain displays, enabling&#x2F;disabling HDR doesn’t always work, and sometimes even SDR content looks dimmer than usual. Some of these issues have been fixed, but your mileage may vary considering how inconsistent Windows can be when it comes to fixing bugs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Most-Games-Are-Not-Optimized-for-HDR"><a href="#5-Most-Games-Are-Not-Optimized-for-HDR" class="headerlink" title="5.

Most Games Are Not Optimized for HDR</h2><p> One of the many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/pc-gaming-myths-debunked/" >common myths surrounding PC gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that you need high-end hardware to fully enjoy it. However, most people are rocking budget or mid-range systems that can play games comfortably at 1080p or 1440p. The high-end market is smaller than you may think, and HDR gaming is an even smaller market in comparison.</p><p> Developers don’t want to dedicate a lot of time or budget to creating an experience that only a handful of people will be able to enjoy. The experience you get from games that support HDR varies from title to title. One game might look superb, but others won’t. In comparison, the HDR experience is usually better on consoles because those games are developed with specific hardware in mind.</p><h2 id="6-You-Need-a-Powerful-PC"><a href="#6-You-Need-a-Powerful-PC" class="headerlink" title="6. You Need a Powerful PC"></a>6. You Need a Powerful PC</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/big-flat-screen-computer-monitor-set-up-on-a-desk-for-gaming.jpg"                      alt="computer monitor set up on a desk for gaming"                ></p><p> It’s obvious that you care about visuals if you’re thinking of buying an HDR monitor. This means cranking all those graphical settings in-game to the max and turning on HDR when it’s available. Now while HDR itself doesn’t require any extra graphical horsepower, playing games at max settings does require high-end hardware.</p><p> The problem is that high-end hardware isn’t accessible to most people. You could buy a budget or mid-range PC and pair it with an expensive HDR monitor, but that doesn’t make much sense. It’s a better idea to dedicate more money toward performance than to a feature that only works well with certain games.</p><h2 id="The-Disappointing-State-of-HDR-in-PC-Gaming"><a href="#The-Disappointing-State-of-HDR-in-PC-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="The Disappointing State of HDR in PC Gaming"></a>The Disappointing State of HDR in PC Gaming</h2><p> This post is a bit of a downer, but it’s the sad truth. HDR gaming on PCs is not quite there yet. Even though monitor prices have decreased in the past few years and displays are getting better, optimization is still a big issue. Most studios don’t have the budget to dedicate resources to HDR content, and that’s mainly why the experience is so subpar at the moment.</p><p> The entire ordeal is especially disappointing because PC gaming is supposed to deliver the best graphical performance possible. Considering, HDR gaming is better on consoles than it is on PCs, it might be one of the few reasons why switching to console gaming isn’t exactly a bad idea.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-get-your-grip-on-video-transferring-how-to-download-igtv-easily/"><u>[New] Get Your Grip on Video Transferring How to Download IGTV Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-increase-conversions-with-these-top-marketing-phrases/"><u>[Updated] Increase Conversions with These Top Marketing Phrases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/cookiebot-integration-the-key-to-advanced-online-customer-insights/"><u>Cookiebot Integration: The Key to Advanced Online Customer Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/-insight-engine-highest-chart-tracker-for-2024/"><u>Elite Insight Engine Highest Chart Tracker for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elite-performance-logitech-gaming-mouse/"><u>Elite Performance Logitech Gaming Mouse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/haptic-sensation-vs-tactile-tablet-triumph-in-car-races/"><u>Haptic Sensation Vs.
