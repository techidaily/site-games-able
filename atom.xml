Here’s a thorough guide on installing Windows 11 on your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id="Why-You-Should-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Install Windows on Your Steam Deck"></a>Why You Should Install Windows on Your Steam Deck</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/steam-deck-surrounded-by-peripherals.JPG"                      alt="Steam Deck surrounded by peripherals"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> If you’re someone who owns a PC, the chances are very high that you’re running Windows on it. Windows is familiar to many and is fairly easy to use.</p><p> While not having a mouse and keyboard on your Steam Deck will pose some navigation issues, having an operating system that’s familiar to you and that you know how to use might be worth that sacrifice.</p><p> Having Windows on your Steam Deck can also make it a work laptop or desktop replacement. You can easily use Photoshop, Microsoft Office apps, Lightroom, and all the usual suspects on Windows—so long as you’re willing to bring around a mouse and keyboard. Thankfully, there are plenty of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/essential-steam-deck-accessories/" >Steam Deck accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can make doing real work on it a breeze.</p><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Install Windows on Your Steam Deck"></a>What You Need to Install Windows on Your Steam Deck</h2><p> You only need a few things to install Windows on your Steam Deck, most of which are software. But you will need a few hardware accessories as well.</p><h3 id="Hardware"><a href="#Hardware" class="headerlink" title="Hardware"></a>Hardware</h3><p> For hardware, you really only need a USB flash drive and a USB-C hub to plug it into your Steam Deck. You can also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-install-steam-deck-sd-card/" >install an SD card on your Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as long as it’s decently fast. A USB 3.0 or higher flash drive or a UHS-I or higher SD card would suffice, but we wouldn’t suggest anything slower.</p><p> We also highly suggest using a separate PC as we’ve done in this guide, but you can also use your Steam Deck and follow similar steps using the Linux version of Ventoy.</p><h3 id="Ventoy"><a href="#Ventoy" class="headerlink" title="Ventoy"></a>Ventoy</h3><p> The first piece of software is Ventoy, a program that allows you to boot multiple ISOs from one external storage device without needing to format it to add a different ISO. This will avoid the back-and-forth formatting of the storage device used, making it easier to go back in case you make a mistake along the way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ventoy-windows-zip-file-from-github.jpg"                      alt="Ventoy Windows zip file from GitHub"                ></p><p> Head to<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/" >Ventoy’s GitHub page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and on the right side, click on<strong>Releases</strong> .

You can easily find this on<a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows11" >Microsoft’s Windows 11 page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downloading-windows-11-iso-from-microsoft.jpg"                      alt="Downloading Windows 11 ISO from Microsoft"                ></p><p> Head to the<strong>Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO)</strong> option and on the dropdown menu, select<strong>Windows 11 (multi-edition ISO)</strong> . Click on<strong>Download</strong> , then select your language. It should then give you another download button to download the Windows ISO that is about 6GB to 7GB in size.</p><h3 id="Windows-Drivers-for-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Windows-Drivers-for-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Windows Drivers for Steam Deck"></a>Windows Drivers for Steam Deck</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downloading-windows-drivers-for-steam-deck.jpg"                      alt="Downloading Windows Drivers for Steam Deck"                ></p><p> Windows doesn’t support all the Steam Deck’s hardware straight from the get-go. Fortunately, Steam has provided Windows drivers so that your audio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, SD card reader, and APU are all working properly.</p><p> You can find and download the Windows drivers for your Steam Deck on the<a class="link"   href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8" >Steam Deck Windows Resources support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Extract all of them into a single folder so that you can paste it onto your SD card or flash drive later.</p><h2 id="How-to-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck"><a href="#How-to-Install-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="How to Install Windows on Your Steam Deck"></a>How to Install Windows on Your Steam Deck</h2><p> If you’ve got your flash drive or SD card ready with all the software downloaded, you can now start turning your Steam Deck into a Windows experience. In our case, we’ll be using an SD card so that we don’t need to deal with a USB hub or a dock.</p><h3 id="1-Install-Ventoy-on-Your-Flash-Drive-or-SD-Card"><a href="#1-Install-Ventoy-on-Your-Flash-Drive-or-SD-Card" class="headerlink" title="1. Install Ventoy on Your Flash Drive or SD Card"></a>1. Install Ventoy on Your Flash Drive or SD Card</h3><p> To be able to run both the GParted and the Windows 11 ISOs from one SD card without needing to format it multiple times, you’ll need to use Ventoy. This will make things way more convenient.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/run-ventoy2disk-from-extracted-folder.jpg"                      alt="Run Ventoy2Disk from extracted folder"                ></p><p> To install Ventoy on your flash drive or SD card, you’ll want to plug it into your PC and open the Ventoy folder you extracted earlier. Then click on<strong>Ventoy2Disk.exe</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/selected-sd-card-to-install-ventoy.jpg"                      alt="Selected SD card to install Ventoy"                ></p><p> You’ll then select the storage device you want to store Ventoy on. In our case, it’s the 32GB SD card.

Enter the Steam Deck Boot Manager"></a>2. Enter the Steam Deck Boot Manager</h3><p> Next, you’ll need to boot from the SD card or flash drive you’ve connected to the Steam Deck using the device’s boot manager.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/volume-down-and-power-button-to-enter-steam-deck-boot-manager.JPG"                      alt="Volume down and power button to enter Steam Deck boot manager"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> To do this, shut down your Steam Deck first. Once it’s off, hold down the volume down button and power button until you hear a chime. Once you hear the chime, let go of the power button, but keep holding down the volume down button until the boot manager shows, like in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/no-steamos-option-in-boot-manager.JPG"                      alt="No SteamOS option in boot manager"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> If you hold down the power button after the chime, you’ll most likely end up turning your Steam Deck off again.</p><p> Once you’re in the boot manager, select the SD card or flash drive. This should show Ventoy and both the Windows and GParted ISOs.</p><h3 id="3-Use-GParted-to-Partition-Your-Internal-SSD"><a href="#3-Use-GParted-to-Partition-Your-Internal-SSD" class="headerlink" title="3. Use GParted to Partition Your Internal SSD"></a>3. Use GParted to Partition Your Internal SSD</h3><p> You’ll now need to partition your Steam Deck’s SSD. If you don’t, you most likely won’t be able to install Windows 11 on the &#x2F;home partition, and you’ll also end up wiping SteamOS from your drive.</p><p> If you want just Windows on your Steam Deck, you can also use Ventoy to wipe all partitions and either leave the combined partition as unallocated or format it as NTFS. We don’t suggest this, however, as SteamOS really is the best way to experience the Steam Deck. It’s better to have the option to switch between the two than be stuck with just Windows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gparted-iso-on-ventoy.JPG"                      alt="GParted ISO on Ventoy"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> On Ventoy, select GParted to run it. You can run it in normal mode, but if that doesn’t work, grub2 might do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/enter-gparted-live-first-option.JPG"                      alt="Enter GParted Live first option"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> Once GParted is open, you’ll be greeted with a few things before you can get to partitioning. Firstly, you’ll need to select the settings. Pick the first one—<strong>GParted Live (Default Settings)</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gparted-don-t-touch-keymap-option.JPG"                      alt="GParted Don&#39;t touch keymap option"                ></p><p> Next, select<strong>Don’t touch keymap</strong> and then select your language. If you’re just going to use English, we suggest just pressing A on the Steam Deck until you reach the main screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/selecting-steam-deck-ssd-in-gparted.JPG"                      alt="Selecting Steam Deck SSD in GParted"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> Finally, you’re ready to partition your SSD. By this point, you can plug in your mouse and keyboard to make it easier to navigate. If your SD card or flash drive is the only thing you can see, switch it to your SSD on the upper right drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/resizing-home-partition-on-steam-deck-ssd.JPG"                      alt="Resizing home partition on Steam Deck SSD"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> To partition your SSD, right-click (left trigger) on the**&#x2F;home** partition or the largest partition on the SSD. Click on<strong>Resize&#x2F;Move</strong> and move the right wall to the left, leaving the empty space as a new unallocated partition.</p><p> In our case, we’re leaving around 250 GB or about 250,000 MiB for Windows 11. Click on the<strong>Resize&#x2F;Move</strong> button on the bottom right to make your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/unallocated-partition-on-gparted.JPG"                      alt="Unallocated partition on GParted"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> Finally, click on the<strong>green check mark</strong> in the toolbar. Forgetting to do this will not apply your partition changes.</p><p> The software will then process the new partition sizes, which may take a few minutes depending on how big your SSD is. Once it’s done, you can now press the power button to exit GParted and power down.</p><h3 id="4-Windows-11-Setup-on-the-Steam-Deck"><a href="#4-Windows-11-Setup-on-the-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="4. Windows 11 Setup on the Steam Deck"></a>4. Windows 11 Setup on the Steam Deck</h3><p> Now you’re ready to install Windows on your Steam Deck. Before you go to the boot manager though, unplug any other USB devices you used earlier except the flash drive.

To install the two audio drivers, simply right-click (left trigger) on the file that says<strong>Setup information</strong> and click<strong>Install</strong> .</p><p> Once they’re all installed, you can now restart your Steam Deck. If things didn’t go so smoothly, you can refer to the section below to find your issue and the solution for it.</p><h2 id="Potential-Issues-and-Solutions-While-Installing-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Potential-Issues-and-Solutions-While-Installing-Windows-on-Your-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Potential Issues and Solutions While Installing Windows on Your Steam Deck"></a>Potential Issues and Solutions While Installing Windows on Your Steam Deck</h2><p> We’ve compiled a few issues that we came across during our installation and found solutions to them so that you don’t have to scour the internet to find fixes.</p><h3 id="ISOs-Show-a-Black-Screen-or-Don’t-Boot-Up"><a href="#ISOs-Show-a-Black-Screen-or-Don’t-Boot-Up" class="headerlink" title="ISOs Show a Black Screen or Don’t Boot Up"></a>ISOs Show a Black Screen or Don’t Boot Up</h3><p> If the ISOs aren’t working properly, just press the power button once to exit and shut down. This is most likely due to other USB devices plugged into your Steam Deck like a keyboard and mouse. This is why we used an SD card in our installation. Remove all USB devices except your flash drive or use a USB-C flash drive if possible.</p><p> If this doesn’t work, you may also try to delete the other ISO from the SD card or flash drive. You may also try reinstalling Ventoy as a last resort, but this will format the drive so make sure you have everything in a folder that you can easily paste onto the drive.</p><h3 id="The-Windows-0x80300001-Error"><a href="#The-Windows-0x80300001-Error" class="headerlink" title="The Windows 0x80300001 Error"></a>The Windows 0x80300001 Error</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/selecting-partition-created-in-gparted.JPG"                      alt="Selecting partition created in GParted"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> This error will most likely pop up because the partition you want to install Windows on isn’t in NTFS format or a blank unallocated partition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wrong-ext4-partition-format-for-windows-on-gparted.JPG"                      alt="Wrong ext4 partition format for Windows on GParted"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MUO</p><p> You may have created a new partition as ext4 in GParted instead of leaving the unallocated partition as it is.

Even though it’s a dedicated gaming machine, you should follow the same care and ethics you would show to your desktop to your PS5.</p><p> And while there are various “best practices,” one of the most forgotten is turning off your PS5 when you don’t need it. While it’s yours, and you can do with it whatever you want, it’s best to let it rest to prolong its life. We’ve gathered here all the reasons why you shouldn’t leave your PS5 running.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Your-PS5-Can-Overheat"><a href="#1-Your-PS5-Can-Overheat" class="headerlink" title="1. Your PS5 Can Overheat"></a>1. Your PS5 Can Overheat</h2><p> Overheating typically has two effects. The first one is temporary, and it means your PS5 will shut down to regulate temperature, disrupting whatever process is currently going on. The second is permanent, irreversible damage to your PS5’s internal components.</p><p> While your PS5, normally, should be able to regulate its own temperature with no problems, leaving it on with a game running in the background could cause heat to compound inside the PS5 and around its immediate environment. The possibility of this happening is low, but not entirely impossible—especially if your PS5 is in an unventilated location like a cabinet, so you should even risk it.</p><p> There are<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-ps5-overheating/" >things you can do to stop your PS5 from overheating <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like a supplementary external fan.

However, most games should demand between 150 to 250 watts. While this is seemingly small, it could multiply over the course of several days.</p><p> And it’s even worse if you leave your TV on as well because<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-watts-does-a-tv-use-how-much-costs-to-watch/" >the average consumption for a modern TV is about 175 watts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Leaving your PS5 and TV running for 24 hours could cost you anything from 6 kilowatts to 10.8 kilowatts per day.</p><p> The average cost of electricity in the US is about 12 cents per unit of kilowatts. When you do the math, you’ll see that it could cost you between $0.72 to $1.30 per day and around $10 for an entire week.</p><h2 id="3-Your-PS5-Will-Get-Dirty-Faster"><a href="#3-Your-PS5-Will-Get-Dirty-Faster" class="headerlink" title="3. Your PS5 Will Get Dirty Faster"></a>3. Your PS5 Will Get Dirty Faster</h2><p> We talked about overheating earlier, but we didn’t mention how dust, dirt, and debris buildup are major contributors to overheating. Over time this dirt buildup could clog your PS5’s vents and layer on its internal fan, causing it to be much less effective. In some cases, this buildup could cause irreparable damage if it affects sensitive internals.</p><p> Turning your PS5 off also turns its fan off, which, typically, works similarly to a vacuum cleaner by sucking in air from outside to cool the PS5’s internals. The more time it spends, the more dust and debris it’ll suck into the PS5.</p><p> You should be very wary of this if you live in a dusty state like Nevada or California. If you live in a dusty place, you would have to put more effort than other PS5 users into cleaning your PS5. Open up the cover of your console, inspect it for dust, and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clean-ps5-console-controller/" >clean your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

But if you’re also like me, then your internet usage is expensive. Leaving your PS5 on gives your PS5 the opportunity to download and update games you probably haven’t played for multiple months, wasting your limited and expensive internet.</p><p> You could turn off auto-updates, but it will mean that the online games you love playing might be out of date when you decide to play them. A good compromise would be if Sony added a feature that would let you keep certain games up to date. But the PS5 has no such feature; you must automatically update all or automatically update none.</p><p> Turning off your PS5 will help you control what’s downloading better. You get a notification of what your PS5 is updating when you turn your PS5 on, and you can quickly head into the Downloads window and stop downloads you don’t want.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Hardware-Wears-Out-Quicker"><a href="#5-Hardware-Wears-Out-Quicker" class="headerlink" title="5.

But a five-year-old PS5 and a PS5 that has seen five years of active use aren’t the same. If you care about keeping your PS5 for a long time, you should shut it down when you don’t need it.</p><p> There are mechanical components in your PS5 that benefit from rest, like the fan and the disc reader (remove discs you’re not using). And if you find that you constantly have to open your PS5 to replace parts or take it for repairs, you already have a PS5 with a drastically lower resale value and an impaired gaming experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Unforeseen-Power-Outages-Cause-a-Greater-Risk-of-Data-Corruption"><a href="#6-Unforeseen-Power-Outages-Cause-a-Greater-Risk-of-Data-Corruption" class="headerlink" title="6.

Technically, you can always re-download or re-install the game, but you will likely lose your progress unless you have<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-back-up-data-ps5/" >backed your PS5 data up <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Your PS5 is prone to get corrupted the longer it stays on. And this probability is a lot higher if you have auto-updates turned on. There’s a reason why your PS5 and video games warn you not to turn off your console while it’s writing data on the drive.</p><p> The main culprit for this is random power outages, which could happen from circumstances beyond your control. There could be electric repairs going on that result in your power cutting off. In some cases, somebody could just unplug your PS5 because they thought it was off. Leaving your PS5 on with things downloading or saving in the background is a prime opportunity for data corruption to happen if you lose power unexpectedly.</p><p> While your PS5 downloads apps and games in rest mode, it doesn’t do any saving or run any games. So, you shouldn’t be too worried about losing power while your PS5 is in rest mode.</p><h2 id="PS5’s-Rest-Mode-Exists-for-a-Reason"><a href="#PS5’s-Rest-Mode-Exists-for-a-Reason" class="headerlink" title="PS5’s Rest Mode Exists for a Reason"></a>PS5’s Rest Mode Exists for a Reason</h2><p> If you certainly have to leave your PS5 on, then you should take advantage of rest mode. As long as you have rest mode on, your PS5 will automatically update games and finish downloads. Additionally, rest mode uses about 1.50 watts of power, and your plugged-in but switched-off PS5 uses around 1.30 watts of power—so there’s not much of a difference.</p><p> Turn rest mode on when you have downloads and shut down your PS5 when you don’t need it at all.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/new-harnessing-home-content-a-commercialized-vlog-journey/"><u>[New] Harnessing Home Content A Commercialized Vlog Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-master-the-art-of-tiktok-video-making-with-ease-and-flair/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Master the Art of TikTok Video Making with Ease & Flair</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-for-penning-persuasive-vlogger-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Strategies for Penning Persuasive Vlogger Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-how-ps4-works-with-personal-computers/"><u>Bridging the Gap: How PS4 Works with Personal Computers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/digital-fields-await-the-7-greatest-sports-apps-iosandroid/"><u>Digital Fields Await: The 7 Greatest Sports Apps (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/elite-metaverse-visor-choices-the-top-8-list/"><u>Elite Metaverse Visor Choices The Top 8 List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-solutions-to-spy-on-tecno-pop-7-pro-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Solutions to Spy on Tecno Pop 7 Pro with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-of-powerdirector-24-features/"><u>In-Depth Analysis of PowerDirector '24 Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/nvidias-shift-to-rtx-need-an-rtx-upgrade/"><u>Nvidia's Shift to RTX: Need an RTX Upgrade?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/process-of-screen-sharing-poco-x6-pro-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Process of Screen Sharing Poco X6 Pro to PC- Detailed Steps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/quickening-online-interactions-diminishing-extensive-data-transmission-delay/"><u>Quickening Online Interactions: Diminishing Extensive Data Transmission Delay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-10-best-deals-in-playstations-summer-sale/"><u>The 10 Best Deals in PlayStation’s Summer Sale</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-discovering-why-steam-dominates-games/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Discovering Why Steam Dominates Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/top-10-quick-and-free-jpeg-to-gif-conversion-services/"><u>Top 10 Quick & Free JPEG-to-GIF Conversion Services</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So manufacturers are taking advantage of IFA—one of the world’s biggest consumer electronics and appliances shows—held annually in Berlin.</p><p> So, what has IFA 2023 turned up for entertainment aficionados? Let’s check out the best new TVs and monitors our team has seen on the ground.</p><h2 id="AWOL-Vision-Vanish-Laser-TV"><a href="#AWOL-Vision-Vanish-Laser-TV" class="headerlink" title="AWOL Vision Vanish Laser TV"></a>AWOL Vision Vanish Laser TV</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/awol-ifa-2023.jpg"                      alt="AWOL IFA 2023"                ></p><p> The trends in TV screen size are increasing year-by-year—<a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/961283/united-states-average-tv-screen-size/" >according to Statista <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the average TV size in the US was 38 inches in 2012, rising to 50 inches by 2022. However, as TV sizes increase, they occupy more space, even when you’re not using them.</p><p> So, to help address this, AWOL introduced the Vision Vanish Laser TV. This unit incorporates a laser TV projector, a retracting screen, and a smart cabinet holding it all together. All this comes out to a 100 or 120-inch screen with 3D and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-memc-does-your-smartphone-need-it/" >MEMC technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> By putting this all together, you get a high-end that features 3,500 NASI lumens brightness with HDR 10+ support and 36-watt Dolby-compatible speakers. It also has a 4K resolution, and the company claims that the screen’s lag is only 30ms when gaming mode is activated, making it an excellent gaming display.</p><h2 id="Hisense-200-Inch-Laser-TVs"><a href="#Hisense-200-Inch-Laser-TVs" class="headerlink" title="Hisense 200-Inch Laser TVs"></a>Hisense 200-Inch Laser TVs</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/hisense-200-inch-laser-tv.jpg"                      alt="Hisense 200-inch Laser TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Justin Duino &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> If you need to go larger than 120 inches, your next best option is Hisense’s 200-inch Laser TVs.

Thankfully, doing so is very easy and will take just a few minutes.</p><p> Begin by switching your PS5 console on. You can then reconnect your controller manually using a USB-A to USB-C cable. Plug the USB-A side into your console and the USB-C side into the slot at the top of your controller. The controller will reconnect automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bluetooth-accessories-tab-in-general-ps5-settings.jpg"                      alt="Bluetooth Accessories tab in General PS5 Settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> You can also reconnect wirelessly using Bluetooth if you have two controllers, as long as one is synced already.</p><p> Using your primary controller, head to your PS5<strong>Settings</strong> and head to<strong>Accessories</strong> . Open<strong>Bluetooth Accessories</strong> from the<strong>General</strong> tab and place your controller back into pairing mode by holding the Create and PS buttons down. Once the second controller appears, select it to reconnect to your PS5.</p><p> Using touchscreen controls to game on your mobile device can be clunky and difficult, and your thumbs end up covering a large part of your display. Using any Bluetooth controller will vastly improve your mobile gaming experience. But since the DualSense is one of the best controllers on the market, it will massively level up the experience of gaming on your phone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-integrating-text-overlays-into-social-media-streaming/"><u>[New] Integrating Text Overlays Into Social Media Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-arcade-affordability-bar-reviews/"><u>[Updated] ARCADE AFFORDABILITY BAR Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-ways-to-fix-it-when-my-honor-x9a-wont-charge-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Ways to Fix it When My Honor X9a Wont Charge | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-enhance-audio-quality-get-high-quality-fx/"><u>2024 Approved Enhance Audio Quality, Get High-Quality FX!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-twitch-live-with-youtube-channel-success/"><u>2024 Approved Integrating Twitch Live with YouTube Channel Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/a-comprerans-insight-into-crucial-gaming-screen-features/"><u>A Compreran's Insight Into Crucial Gaming Screen Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-resolve-steam-errors-in-windows-11-quickly/"><u>How to Resolve Steam Errors in Windows 11 Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-safe-and-effective-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-se-2020-without-a-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, 8 Safe and Effective Methods to Unlock Your Apple iPhone SE (2020) Without a Passcode | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-spectrum-analysis-exploring-the-depths-of-bublcam-360/"><u>In 2024, Full Spectrum Analysis Exploring the Depths of Bublcam 360</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/keep-steam-titles-under-wraps/"><u>Keep Steam Titles Under Wraps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/stepwise-instructions-snapchat-for-mac-users-for-2024/"><u>Stepwise Instructions Snapchat for Mac Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/what-makes-a-great-steam-deck/"><u>What Makes a Great Steam Deck?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

They are optional payments that help game developers and publishers make money from games they otherwise might not have. However, microtransactions have increasingly snuck into premium, paid games. Is this trend, perhaps, justifiable?</p><h2 id="Why-Do-Microtransactions-Exist-in-Video-Games-At-All"><a href="#Why-Do-Microtransactions-Exist-in-Video-Games-At-All" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Microtransactions Exist in Video Games At All?"></a>Why Do Microtransactions Exist in Video Games At All?</h2><p> You might recall a time when microtransactions did not exist. You bought a game, and that was it—you owned all the content in it. But let’s be completely honest: did that ever really exist?</p><p> Going back to the time of playing video games in an arcade, developers created games to wring as much change from your pocket as they could. Some arcades had games with items you could purchase with real money. These in-game items were designed to make the game a little easier or to give you extra health. So, when games moved to homes from arcades, the culture of in-game microtransactions followed them.</p><p> At first, it came as expansion packs (<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dlc-video-games/" >now known as DLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), which you had to buy separately to expand the game’s content. But it didn’t take long for developers to realize they could make more money from selling small bits of seemingly inconsequential content for a token price.</p><p> Eventually, this trend led to the introduction of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/are-loot-boxes-in-video-games-a-form-of-gambling-should-you-avoid-them/" >loot boxes and gacha microtransactions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . These were not just game-changers but financial jackpots. In fact, one of the pioneers in this field, ZT Online (2007), was raking in a staggering $15 million monthly at its peak.</p><p> Before we knew it, we had Facebook games like Farmville that offered Farm Cash to make the game easier to play and progress faster. From there, it made its way to mobile as smartphone games, like Clash of Clans.</p><p> Now, they have become a core monetization component of freemium games. Some free games have based their business model on dynamic seasonal content called battle passes, which works on a subscription-type model. Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone are the most famous examples. For these free games, it might be the only way to keep the games free.</p><p>But what about premium games? Should they have microtransactions?</p><h2 id="Why-Microtransactions-Are-Appearing-in-Premium-Games"><a href="#Why-Microtransactions-Are-Appearing-in-Premium-Games" class="headerlink" title="Why Microtransactions Are Appearing in Premium Games"></a>Why Microtransactions Are Appearing in Premium Games</h2><p> So why are we seeing microtransactions in premium, even AAA, games? The short answer to this question is more money. We are at a time in the entertainment industry where it’s not enough to make a decent profit, but the company must grow every year.</p><p> This ideology has seeped strongly into the highly lucrative gaming industry, and most (if not all) of the perpetrators are publicly traded corporations eager to please shareholders.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/elder-scrolls-obvlivion-gold-horse-armor.png"                      alt="Elder Scrolls Obvlivion gold horse armor"                ></p><p> However, it didn’t start today; we can see signs of this as far back as 2006. The most infamous early example was Horse Armor in The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion (2006). Horse Armor was a $2.50 DLC package Microsoft and Bethesda added to the Xbox 360 release of the game.</p><p> The DLC caused a lot of uproar on the internet and became something of a meme representing video game features that are useless and overpriced. However, reports indicate that the DLC was still a huge financial success.</p><p> Another indicator of how successful in-game microtransactions can be is Blizzard Entertainment’s Overwatch, released in 2016. It was an online multiplayer game, sold for anything between $40 to $60. Overwatch was filled with cosmetic microtransactions and loot boxes (which could be earned or bought), and it was still a commercial and critical success.</p><p> Many other publicly traded game developers have followed suit, releasing full-fledged premium games with $60 or more price tags, trying to make extra money from their releases.</p><h2 id="Are-Microtransactions-Good-for-the-Gaming-Industry"><a href="#Are-Microtransactions-Good-for-the-Gaming-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Are Microtransactions Good for the Gaming Industry?"></a>Are Microtransactions Good for the Gaming Industry?</h2><p> On the surface, more money in an industry is always a good thing. It allows companies to have bigger budgets to research and develop better games, and it allows better marketing to introduce the products to diverse audiences.</p><p> Also, without microtransactions, free games would not exist or would have little to no support. In that sense, microtransactions can be positive since they give gamers an opportunity to support the industry. But if we’re being honest, putting them in a game you’ve already paid for in full doesn’t help anybody but the company.</p><p> Some might argue that it’s not doing any harm, and microtransactions in premium games aren’t compulsory; they offer only cosmetic changes. The problem, though, is that when you give a profit-driven company that kind of access, it’s almost always exploited to the consumer’s detriment.</p><h3 id="Paying-More-to-Experience-Less"><a href="#Paying-More-to-Experience-Less" class="headerlink" title="Paying More to Experience Less"></a>Paying More to Experience Less</h3><p> Let’s look at Middle-earth: Shadow of War as a case study. It was released as a sequel to Shadow of Mordor, a well-received game using the proprietary nemesis system.</p><p> Piggybacking off the success of its predecessor, the game was released with microtransactions and loot boxes (War Chests) specifically designed to force you to pay or grind harder to finish the game. This was met with severe backlash, and eventually, in 2017, roughly a year after its release, they had to remove all microtransactions from Shadow of War.</p><p> Apart from the inherent gambling nature of loot boxes, as a creator and an artist, doesn’t it feel fundamentally wrong to offer people a way to pay to experience less of your creation? It gives people the idea that your game is a chore, which shouldn’t be the case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Bloat-and-Battle-Passes"><a href="#Bloat-and-Battle-Passes" class="headerlink" title="Bloat and Battle Passes"></a>Bloat and Battle Passes</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/assassin-s-creed-origins-season-pass-for-sale-on-ubisoft-website.png"                      alt="Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins Season Pass for sale on Ubisoft website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Another way you can tell microtransactions don’t have a place in premium games is that they only worm their way into established franchises. Ubisoft is a good example of this, seeing as it has added seasonal passes to many titles in their (mostly) offline single-player adventure series, Assassin’s Creed.</p><p> Battle passes in games like these use fear of missing out and other psychological tricks to make you purchase them. It’s basically like Horse Armor all over again since you’re paying for skins and cosmetics, which only you will see.</p><p> Companies add these to leverage the cumulated love and loyalty some fans have to these established series—even though they know many wouldn’t like it. In the end, it comes off as parasitic.</p><p> What makes passes even worse is that you have to play the game for a certain amount of time to earn the content on them. We’ve explored more on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/why-you-shouldnt-pay-for-season-passes-or-dlc/" >why you shouldn’t pay for passes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a dedicated piece.</p><p> Additionally, these games end up being bloated, as content you’ve bought, downloaded, and installed is locked behind an additional paywall. This will cost the paying player more internet bills for content they will likely never get to experience.</p><h3 id="A-Dishonest-Means-of-Collecting-More-Money"><a href="#A-Dishonest-Means-of-Collecting-More-Money" class="headerlink" title="A Dishonest Means of Collecting More Money"></a>A Dishonest Means of Collecting More Money</h3><p> If a role-playing game was listed for only $40 and you bought it, only to play it and discover that the hero class you would have loved to play is locked behind an additional $10 paywall—how would you feel? Cheated? That’s because you were.</p><p> It’s downright dishonest to create a core game mechanic and exclude it as an option in the base game. Because you’ve spent $40 already, you might as well spend $10 more to enjoy the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/diablo-iii-selling-necromancer-class-as-extra-content.png"                      alt="Diablo III selling necromancer class as extra content"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Once again, Blizzard makes an appearance. Diablo III costs $19.99, and the Necromancer expansion costs $14.99. It’s unfair that a separate expansion pack that pretty much adds only a class is worth almost as much as the base game. That means Blizzard is fairly confident that the necromancer class is the sole reason some people want to play the game. Yet, it’s not included as part of the standard offer.</p><p> More recent premium games, such as Diablo IV and Dragon’s Dogma 2, have also received criticism for their use of microtransactions.</p><p> Despite the belief that microtransactions are a good way to farm more money off game releases, many premium games have not included any of these tactics, but they have still sold well. The Game Awards 2023’s Game of the Year, Baldur’s Gate 3, for instance, has no microtransactions yet has become one of the most popular and successful video games of its time.</p><p> This is proof that it’s not necessary, and the companies behind these games can still make good money without tainting the sanctity of their craft. Hopefully, we will see a reduction in this trend in the future, but for now, we can only discourage it by not indulging.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-auditory-anatomy-understanding-video-audio-for-ig-feeds/"><u>[New] In 2024, Auditory Anatomy Understanding Video Audio for IG Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-picks-and-tips-for-thriving-in-valheim/"><u>[New] Top Picks & Tips for Thriving in Valheim</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-frosty-footage-comprehensive-analysis-and-tutorial-for-ice-cream-cam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Frosty Footage Comprehensive Analysis & Tutorial for Ice Cream Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-reviving-the-disappearing-video-icon-on-fb-watch-platform/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Reviving the Disappearing Video Icon on FB Watch Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-techniques-for-youtube-to-mp4-conversion/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 Techniques for YouTube to MP4 Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/banishing-discord-disruptions-effective-strategies-to-fix-data-transfer-delays/"><u>Banishing Discord Disruptions: Effective Strategies to Fix Data Transfer Delays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/deciding-on-a-cpu-cooler-the-must-know-8-factors/"><u>Deciding on a CPU Cooler: The Must-Know 8 Factors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discord-setup-made-simple-for-mac-users/"><u>Discord Setup Made Simple for Mac Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-the-best-free-gaming-without-investments/"><u>Discover the Best Free Gaming without Investments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exploring-iems-for-ultimate-gameplay-immersion/"><u>Exploring IEMs for Ultimate Gameplay Immersion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/is-there-an-end-in-sight-for-conventional-essays-the-impact-of-chatgpt-on-academia/"><u>Is There an End in Sight for Conventional Essays: The Impact of ChatGPT on Academia?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/nine-playful-phrase-swapping-games-for-friendly-teasing/"><u>Nine Playful Phrase Swapping Games for Friendly Teasing</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now, with just a few taps on your smartphone, you can compete against opponents worldwide and hone your skills in single-player matches in your favorite mobile sports games.</p><p> Below, we’ve created a list of the best sports games for mobile users, each offering unique features that have earned them a spot on our list. We’ve included a game from every popular sport on this list, so no matter which sports your passion lies in, you’re likely to find a game that caters to your interests.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Table-Tennis-Touch"><a href="#1-Table-Tennis-Touch" class="headerlink" title="1.

The game boasts four engaging modes: Career, Quick Game, and Arcade.</p><p> The Quick Game mode can be played against AI-controlled opponents from various countries. All you have to do to play is hit the ball across the table by swiping your racket. You’re awarded a point if your opponent misses the ball, and you lose a point to your opponent if you miss the ball instead.</p><p> One thing disappointing about the game is that you cannot play against real opponents. Although a multiplayer mode is provided, accessing it requires downloading a separate multiplayer version of Table Tennis Touch called Ping Pong Fury.</p><p> Ping Pong Fury, although popular, lacks many of the features present in Table Tennis Touch, such as offline gameplay and career and arcade modes. The game’s developers should consider integrating a multiplayer mode within Table Tennis Touch itself.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Table Tennis Touch for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/table-tennis-touch/id860620713" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.yakuto.TableTennisTouch" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="2-Tennis-Clash"><a href="#2-Tennis-Clash" class="headerlink" title="2.

The gameplay mechanics are easy to master—all you have to do is position where you want to hit the ball and swipe on the screen to deliver a hit. You earn a point when your opponent fails to return the ball and concede a point if you miss the ball yourself.</p><p> In Tennis Clash, you can play offline matches against an AI opponent or with real players worldwide in iconic locations such as New York, Sydney, Rio, Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, and more. Additionally, you can join or create clubs and play in exciting events.</p><p> One thing that the developers of Tennis Clash could work on is the match-making ability of the game. Several players have complained about being matched to opponents with a far higher skill level. The in-game purchases to level up your player are also a bit costly.</p><p> Aside from these drawbacks, we’d say the game offers the best realistic tennis action we’ve seen in any other tennis game so far.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Tennis Clash for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tennis-clash-sports-stars-game/id1346179411" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tfgco.games.sports.free.tennis.clash" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="3-Real-Cricket-22"><a href="#3-Real-Cricket-22" class="headerlink" title="3.

As you progress through the game, you can upgrade your team of All-Star players through training or by collecting player cards. You can either play against bots in-game or face off against other players’ teams online.</p><p> The game follows simple rules that involve poke-checking opponents to steal the puck and strategically maneuvering your way toward the goal by passing the puck to your teammates. Once you are in a favorable position near the goal, you can aim and shoot to attempt to score a goal.</p><p> However, the game bots in Hockey All Stars do not pose a significant challenge and lack basic defensive and offensive skills, making it too easy to score goals against them. By creating a more balanced and competitive AI system, this game has great potential to deliver a more engaging and enjoyable experience for players.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Hockey All Stars for<a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hockey-all-stars/id1437616335" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> |<a class="link"   href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2026989/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distinctivegames.hockey2019" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id="7-EA-Sports-UFC-2"><a href="#7-EA-Sports-UFC-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

And with some titles encouraging hundreds upon hundreds of hours of endless gameplay loops, your time spent playing can often drift past you completely unnoticed.</p><p> But with some of the supported gaming stats available on Xbox Series X|S, you can check how long you’ve played your games for on the platform. The feature, however, is not without its faults. So, if you want to check in on how much time you’ve sunk into an Xbox game or if you’re having trouble doing so, we can help.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-Time-Played-Stat-on-Xbox"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-Time-Played-Stat-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About the Time Played Stat on Xbox"></a>What You Need to Know About the Time Played Stat on Xbox</h2><p> Unfortunately, before you check your play-time for an Xbox game, you might want to be aware of some key aspects of the feature. And how, despite the<strong>Time played</strong> statistic being a staple feature of Xbox Series X|S game settings, this specific stat can be inconsistent.</p><p> Notably, then, the key things you need to be aware of before looking into the<strong>Time played</strong> statistic for a game of your choice are as follows:</p><ul><li>For most games, the<strong>Time played</strong> stat is consistent, but for some games,<strong>Time played</strong> will display an outdated or incorrectly tracked amount of time.</li><li>Backwards compatible Xbox games you have used with the same Xbox account on past Xbox consoles will only track your time played for time spent on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, not Xbox 360.</li><li>While the<strong>Time played</strong> stat is always available through your Xbox’s settings, not every game tracks this stat. If a game doesn’t record how long you have played, the stat will simply read<strong>0d 0h 0m</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/001-1.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Time Played statistic on Xbox Series X showcasing no time played"                ></p><p> So, while the ability to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-how-to-compare-gaming-stats-with-friends/" >compare Xbox stats with friends on Xbox Series X|S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is mostly accurate, the<strong>Time played</strong> stat is strangely plagued with issues. However, for mainline and current game releases, the time you spend playing will be tracked accurately, unless developers have specifically disabled the feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135359/19272" target="_top" id="2135359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135359/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Check-Your-Time-Played-From-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S"><a href="#How-to-Check-Your-Time-Played-From-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S" class="headerlink" title="How to Check Your Time Played From Your Xbox Series X|S"></a>How to Check Your Time Played From Your Xbox Series X|S</h2><p> Now you know some of the caveats of the feature, you can go ahead and start checking your<strong>Time played</strong> stat for any game you’ve played with your Xbox account without any confusing surprises.</p><p> So, to start checking your<strong>Time played</strong> stat for any game associated with your account on Xbox Series X|S, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the Guide menu.</li><li>Highlight the options for<strong>Game activity</strong> , and select<strong>All achievements</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/game-activity.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Xbox Series X Guide menu with Game Activity and All Achievements highlighted"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080312/19272" target="_top" id="2080312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080312/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Select the game you want to see the<strong>Time played</strong> stat for.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/game-selection.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Achievements screen for Xbox games on an Xbox Series X"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Under<strong>Progress</strong> , highlight<strong>Stats</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/stats.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the gaming statistics screen for Mass Effect Legendary Edition on Xbox Series X|S"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> From the<strong>Stats</strong> screen, your<strong>Time played</strong> is displayed as the first metric. And, if you want to compare your<strong>Time played</strong> for the selected game against your friends, you can select<strong>Time played</strong> for a full comparison leaderboard.</p><p> However, this method is not without fault, and sometimes the<strong>Stats</strong> menu for games is inaccurate or unsupported.

However, while common, not every game you play supports independent statistics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot-2893.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Load screen for Mass Effect Legendary Edition on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> Alternatively, the Xbox app for Windows and PC can help to reveal an accurate<strong>Time played</strong> stat for your Xbox games. By using the<strong>Achievements</strong> tab and selecting a game, you can access the<strong>Time played</strong> stat outside your Xbox Series X|S.

For example, ROG consistently integrates the latest, cutting-edge CPU and GPU options as soon as they are released. ROG laptops were some of the first to utilize Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs, giving ROG an edge in performance and future-proofing over TUF, which often uses prior generation or more mainstream components to hit lower price points.</p><p> The story is similar for displays. ROG gaming laptops push the boundaries with features like 300Hz+ refresh rates, 1440p or 4K resolutions, and mini-LED backlighting for enhanced contrast. TUF screens still offer solid gaming performance with refresh rates around 144Hz and 1080p resolution but stop short of the bleeding-edge technology ROG debuts.</p><p> For some, TUF represents a sweet spot that balances capability and cost. But for buyers wanting an uncompromising top-tier experience, ROG’s cutting-edge parts and screens deliver system performance a notch above the rest.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h2 id="ProArt-Creativity-Unleashed"><a href="#ProArt-Creativity-Unleashed" class="headerlink" title="ProArt: Creativity Unleashed"></a>ProArt: Creativity Unleashed</h2><p> The ProArt series is for content creators and professionals who demand precision and unparalleled performance.

But it is what’s inside this condensed design that makes it one of the best keyboards released by Razer to date. For $190 you can get its classic black design, or for another $10, it’s all white.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-unboxing.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Unboxing"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><h3 id="Compact-but-not-Compromising"><a href="#Compact-but-not-Compromising" class="headerlink" title="Compact, but not Compromising"></a>Compact, but not Compromising</h3><p> The keyboard boasts a compact design, ideal for users with limited desk space. But, despite its smaller size, the BlackWidow V4 75% hasn’t lost many capabilities, having a complete function row, well-placed arrow keys, and a multi-function roller and media buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-top-down-view.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Top Down View"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The Razer BlackWidow V4 75% keyboard features a media roller located in the upper right corner as well as two dedicated media buttons. That said, I would have liked to see the roller include a press-to-mute function to free up the second media key for different quick access options.</p><p> Another noticeable absence is the lack of a pass-through USB port, with only one USB-C port to connect to your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-media-keys.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Media Keys"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The included USB-A to USB-C cord is well-constructed. Not being permanently attached, it’s great for those who have transitioned to USB-C devices or prefer coiled cables. Interestingly though, the connector rather fat, making it incompatible with Razer’s other devices, including some of their mice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-cable.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Cable"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Made of pleather, the magnetic wrist rest is plush, comfortable, and stays cool, even with extended use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-wrist-rest.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Wrist Rest"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> With it sloped against the keyboard’s bottom edge, I found that it stayed in place securely, including during more heated Overwatch 2 matches.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-left-side-angled.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Left Side Angled"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><h3 id="Return-of-the-Orange"><a href="#Return-of-the-Orange" class="headerlink" title="Return of the Orange"></a>Return of the Orange</h3><p> The keyboard features a socketed PCB preloaded with the brand’s Gen-3 Razer™ Orange Tactile Mechanical Switches, offering a tactile and quiet typing experience without compromising on performance.

These factory-lubricated switches were a fan favorite for years but were eventually discontinued, to much dismay. The previous switches used monochrome LED, while the new design features Chroma RGB with full-color backlighting support thanks to its transparent casing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-orange-and-yellow-switches.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Orange and Yellow Switches"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Compared to Razer’s other switch options—Razer Green and Yellow switches—Orange tactile switches are known for their satisfying bump, offering a pleasant typing experience while maintaining a more subdued sound. For many, this made it the best of both worlds, with an excellent feel without an overwhelming clicky sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-removing-caps.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Removing Caps"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> The Green switches provide a loud click with a noticeable bump, with an actuation point of 1.9mm and an actuation force of 50g. In comparison, the Yellow switches—my personal favorite—deliver a smooth and quiet keystroke with an actuation point of just 1.2mm and an actuation force of 45g.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-razer-switches.png"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75 - Razer Switches"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Razer</p><h3 id="Keycaps"><a href="#Keycaps" class="headerlink" title="Keycaps"></a>Keycaps</h3><p> The keycaps themselves are made of doubleshot ABS, which may be a bit disappointing for those who prefer sturdier PBT material. Razer has seemingly taken the disadvantages of ABS keycaps into account, however, improving their design with a textured feel that’s intended to resist wear and reduce exposure to oils from the user’s hands, which contribute to unwanted shininess and degradation over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-removing-key-cap.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Removing Key Cap"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> While the provided switches are three-pin, the BlackWidow’s PCB is a five-socket design, accommodating Razer’s own switches as well as third-party options, which is a welcome addition. Customizers can also get right to work, with the keycap and switch puller included in its box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-pins.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Pins"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997690/19272" target="_top" id="1997690">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997690" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997690/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><h3 id="Backplate"><a href="#Backplate" class="headerlink" title="Backplate"></a>Backplate</h3><p> Interestingly, that’s not to say that all customization is encouraged by Razer. Even though the design allows for users to swap out the BlackWidow V4’s plate-mounted stabilizers for the screw-in variety, doing so will automatically void your warranty.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-back.jpg"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75% - Back"                ></p><p> Paul Antill &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Fair warning to those who may think that Razer’s full customization support is unwavering—it’s not. On one hand, this is great for users who want the ultimate control over personalization, though that instant sacrifice may have you reconsider the tradeoff.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/razer-blackwidow-75-internals.png"                      alt="Razer Blackwidow 75 - Internals"                ></p><p>Razer</p><p> In addition to its switch customizability, the BlackWidow V4 75% internal construction has taken even more cues from popular modification designs. These include a gasket-mounted FR4 plate for a “poppier” sound, two layers of sound-dampening foam to prevent unwanted reverb from the aluminum body, and a PCB fire-retardent “tape-mod” that comes pre-installed from the factory. For those unfamiliar with the practice, for years, enthusiasts have taken it upon themselves to use painter’s or duct tape to help deaden the reverberation sound from within the deck. While this step is like a rite of passage for every new keyboard, eliminating the need to open it up for this seemingly simple mod makes you feel like Razer understands its community and users’ wants.</p><h3 id="Lighting"><a href="#Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Lighting"></a>Lighting</h3><p> Together we have 18 lighting zones that are fully customizable with Razer Synapse with reactive effect support for 200+ games.

Do you click on the game icon, but nothing happens, or does the loading screen continue to load indefinitely? This can be extremely frustrating, especially if you’re in the mood to play the game. Why does this issue occur?</p><p> This article will discuss the causes of League of Legends not opening and how to resolve the issue.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Does-League-of-Legends-Refuse-to-Open-on-Windows-Devices"><a href="#Why-Does-League-of-Legends-Refuse-to-Open-on-Windows-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Why Does League of Legends Refuse to Open on Windows Devices?"></a>Why Does League of Legends Refuse to Open on Windows Devices?</h2><p> There could be several reasons why League of Legends doesn’t open on your device or gets stuck on the loading screen. Here are a few major ones:</p><ul><li>Your device does not meet League of Legends system requirements.</li><li>Your device is equipped with the necessary hardware, but it remains overwhelmed by other processes.</li><li>The account you use to play the game has a problem.</li><li>Some redundant files in the Logs and Config folders are interfering with the game’s processing.</li><li>The Windows Defender Firewall is blocking the League of Legends client because it thinks it’s malicious.</li></ul><p> Now that you know the causes, let’s apply the relevant fixes so that you can open and play the game.</p><p> If you encounter a specific error when you launch the game, then you should search for solutions specific to that error. Since every error has a different solution, applying the same fixes covered in this article may not fix all of them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Apply-Preliminary-Checks"><a href="#1-Apply-Preliminary-Checks" class="headerlink" title="1.

Apply Preliminary Checks</h2><p> You should first apply the following preliminary fixes, as they may resolve the problem right away:</p><ul><li>Run League of Legends as an administrator. For that, right-click on the game file and click<strong>Run as administrator</strong> .</li><li>Check the minimum and recommended game requirements from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/game-updates/updated-min-and-recommended-specs-for-lol-tft/" >League of Legends website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and compare them with your device’s specifications. If your hardware does not meet the requirements, it needs to be upgraded.</li><li>To ensure that account-specific issues aren’t causing this problem, create a new account and use it to log in. If you don’t experience any issues this time and the game successfully loads, there is a problem with your other account. Therefore, from now on, you should use the new account.</li><li>Close any other games running concurrently with League of Legends, especially those that use the same gaming client. This will eliminate the possibility of their interference causing the problem.</li><li>Though less likely, having an outdated graphics driver can also cause the issue under discussion. To prevent this, be sure to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/" >update your graphics driver on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li></ul><p> If the above fixes don’t help, start applying the remaining fixes.</p><h2 id="2-Wait-It-Out"><a href="#2-Wait-It-Out" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s more likely to happen if your hardware isn’t strong enough and barely meets the system requirements. So, if you have just launched League of Legends and it appears to be stuck at the loading screen, wait a while to ensure the game isn’t just taking extra time to load.</p><p> If the screen stays stuck for a few minutes, the problem lies elsewhere. Therefore, begin applying the remaining fixes.</p><h2 id="3-Check-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#3-Check-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Your Internet Connection"></a>3. Check Your Internet Connection</h2><p> The League of Legends is a server-dependent multiplayer game. To play the game, your device needs to be connected to the internet. If you’re not connected to the internet, or the connection itself is unstable, the game may not launch or run correctly. Therefore, make sure your device has an active internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-router.jpg"                      alt="router placed on a table"                ></p><p> If the device is connected,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/" >check the stability of the internet connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Disable Cheat Software"></a>4. Disable Cheat Software</h2><p> League of Legends does not tolerate the use of cheats and hacks to gain an advantage in the game. If you modify game files or use cheat software to hack into the game, League of Legends will not let you in. Due to this, the game may not turn on or get stuck on the loading screen.</p><p> If you use any third-party cheat software, turn it off. Also, revert any unauthorized changes you might have made in the game files to gain an unfair advantage.</p><h2 id="5-Relaunch-the-Game-After-Closing-the-Riot-and-LoL-Processes"><a href="#5-Relaunch-the-Game-After-Closing-the-Riot-and-LoL-Processes" class="headerlink" title="5. Relaunch the Game After Closing the Riot and LoL Processes"></a>5. Relaunch the Game After Closing the Riot and LoL Processes</h2><p> First off, close all Riot and League of Legends processes in Task Manager and launch the game again. Taking this step will ensure League of Legends isn’t failing to open due to a temporary glitch. Follow the steps below to close the tasks:</p><ol><li>Type**”Device Manager”** in Windows Search and open the<strong>Task Manager</strong> app.</li><li>Find all Riot and LoL processes.</li><li>To end each process, right-click on it and click<strong>End task</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-ending-the-riot-process-in-windows-task-manager-app.jpg"                      alt="Ending the Riot Process in Windows Task Manager App"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Free-Up-System-Resources"><a href="#6-Free-Up-System-Resources" class="headerlink" title="6. Free Up System Resources"></a>6. Free Up System Resources</h2><p> League of Legends is an extremely resource-hungry game. It requires substantial processing power to function correctly. If your system hardware barely meets the minimum game requirements, ensure enough resources are available for the game to run smoothly.</p><p> To see that, open Task Manager and check the CPU, GPU, and RAM usage. If the usage percentage for these resources touches 100% periodically, your hardware is under severe strain. In other words, the game doesn’t have access to the required resources to function properly.</p><p> If that is the case, you will need to close graphics-intensive tasks simultaneously running alongside the game. By closing them, your system will have more resources available that League of Legends can use to function smoothly.</p><h2 id="7-Delete-the-Config-and-Logs-Folders"><a href="#7-Delete-the-Config-and-Logs-Folders" class="headerlink" title="7. Delete the Config and Logs Folders"></a>7. Delete the Config and Logs Folders</h2><p> Files in the Logs folder contain information about errors and problems you encounter in the game. Likewise, the Config folder contains information regarding game configuration and settings. The issue under discussion can be caused by interference by these files. Therefore, you should delete the aforementioned folders.</p><p> Don’t worry; you can safely delete them because League of Legends will recreate them when you relaunch the game. Follow these steps to delete them:</p><ol><li>Open File Explorer.</li><li>Navigate to the game’s installation folder. If you didn’t change the default location during installation, you’d find the game here:<br><code>C:\Riot Games\League of Legends</code></li><li>Find the<strong>Logs</strong> and<strong>Config</strong> folders.</li><li>To delete these folders, simply right-click on them and select<strong>Delete</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-deleting-the-config-folder-of-league-of-legends-in-windows-file-explorer.jpg"                      alt="Deleting the Config Folder of League of Legends in Windows File Explorer"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044585/7443" target="_top" id="2044585">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044585" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044585/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Disable-Any-Active-In-Game-Overlays"><a href="#8-Disable-Any-Active-In-Game-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="8.

If so, you should disable them before starting the game to ensure the game doesn’t get stuck on the loading screen because of an overlay. To turn off the Discord overlay, follow the below steps:</p><ol><li>Click the<strong>gear icon (User Settings)</strong> in the bottom-right corner.</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Game Overlay</strong> tab on the left.</li><li>Turn off the toggle next to<strong>Enable in-game overlay</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Discord-Overlay.jpg"                      alt="Disabling the Discord Overlay"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902273/19272" target="_top" id="1902273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902273/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you don’t want to turn off the overlay for all games but only League of Legends, follow the below steps:</p><ol><li>Click the<strong>gear icon (User Settings)</strong> in the bottom right corner.</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Registered Games</strong> tab on the left.</li><li>Click the<strong>monitor icon</strong> next to League of Legends.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disable-discord-overlay-for-a-specific-game-1.jpg"                      alt="Disable Discord Overlay for a Specific Game"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you use any other overlay, you can also turn it off in a similar manner within the settings of the app.</p><h2 id="9-Whitelist-League-of-Legends-From-the-Windows-Defender-Firewall"><a href="#9-Whitelist-League-of-Legends-From-the-Windows-Defender-Firewall" class="headerlink" title="9. Whitelist League of Legends From the Windows Defender Firewall"></a>9. Whitelist League of Legends From the Windows Defender Firewall</h2><p> If the game opens for a few seconds and then closes down, the Windows Defender Firewall might be blocking it. To rule out this possibility, you should whitelist League of Legends from Windows Defender Firewall. If you’ve never done that before, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/" >how to allow apps through Windows Firewall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Similarly, if you’re using a third-party antivirus that you think may interfere with the game process, either disable it or whitelist the game files through it.</p><h2 id="10-Reinstall-League-of-Legends"><a href="#10-Reinstall-League-of-Legends" class="headerlink" title="10. Reinstall League of Legends"></a>10. Reinstall League of Legends</h2><p> If none of the above fixes solve your problem and the game doesn’t open, you may need to reinstall it. Before you begin the installation process, you should uninstall the existing installation. Once you have uninstalled it, you can reinstall the game after downloading it from the official website, just as you did the first time.</p><h2 id="Get-Back-to-Playing-League-of-Legends-on-Windows"><a href="#Get-Back-to-Playing-League-of-Legends-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Get Back to Playing League of Legends on Windows"></a>Get Back to Playing League of Legends on Windows</h2><p> When League of Legends does not open, frustration may set in. If your system meets the minimum game requirements and you aren’t experiencing any specific errors, the fixes above should fix the problem, and you should be able to play the game. When none of the fixes work, reinstall the game.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-your-gaming-potential-with-win10-recordings/"><u>[New] Unleashing Your Gaming Potential with Win10 Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-uncovering-stardews-depths-with-ginger-island-adventures-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Uncovering Stardew's Depths with Ginger Island Adventures for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-sixteen-camera-arrays-for-professionals/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Sixteen Camera Arrays for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/best-digital-duos-for-multiplayer-fun-anywhere/"><u>Best Digital Duos for Multiplayer Fun Anywhere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/core-offerings-deciphering-xbox-game-pass-versus-psplus-essentials/"><u>Core Offerings: Deciphering Xbox Game Pass Versus PS+ Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/identifying-if-someone-has-removed-you-from-their-snap-circle-for-2024/"><u>Identifying if Someone Has Removed You From Their Snap Circle for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-screenscout-quest-uncovering-affordable-tiktok-visuals-without-a-cost/"><u>In 2024, ScreenScout Quest Uncovering Affordable TikTok Visuals Without a Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mending-your-ps4-remotes-abrupt-severance-from-pc/"><u>Mending Your PS4 Remote's Abrupt Severance From PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/n2o-switch-speculations-handheld-future-in-focus/"><u>N2O Switch Speculations - Handheld Future in Focus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/navigating-gans-sidestep-common-errors/"><u>Navigating GANs: Sidestep Common Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/roblox-cheat-code-risks-and-mechanics-insight/"><u>Roblox Cheat Code: Risks and Mechanics Insight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-audienceeat-top-10-strategies-to-make-your-youtube-videos-a-hit/"><u>Unlocking the Audience'eat Top 10 Strategies to Make Your YouTube Videos a Hit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/xbox-case-purpose-and-usage/"><u>Xbox Case: Purpose & Usage</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It uses GPU acceleration to ensure that graphics-intensive apps like games can run at a reasonable frame rate.</p><p> Currently, you can play several DirectX 11 games on Parallels Desktop. However, DirectX 12 support is not yet available, so the selection of modern games may be limited.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Playing-Native-Mac-Ports-of-AAA-Titles"><a href="#2-Playing-Native-Mac-Ports-of-AAA-Titles" class="headerlink" title="2.

Apple has also implemented many modern features into its Metal graphics API, like ray tracing and MetalFX, which increases performance by upscaling lower-resolution content to save GPU time, encouraging even more developers to port their games to macOS.</p><p> This is a positive sign for Mac gamers, and it tells us that Apple is committed to making macOS a more viable platform for gaming.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Using-a-Compatibility-Layer-like-CrossOver"><a href="#3-Using-a-Compatibility-Layer-like-CrossOver" class="headerlink" title="3.

Because of this, you may see online gaming communities for certain games as toxic and unapproachable.</p><p> However, with Xbox Series X|S, not only can you record the voice chat of online lobbies for any game, but you can also report any recorded clips of people online if you experience inappropriate online behavior. But how do you record and report voice chat on Xbox Series X|S? Let’s find out.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Limitations-of-Recording-Voice-Chat-on-Xbox"><a href="#The-Limitations-of-Recording-Voice-Chat-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="The Limitations of Recording Voice Chat on Xbox"></a>The Limitations of Recording Voice Chat on Xbox</h2><p> Before defining how you can record or report voice chat, there are a few limitations and stipulations of recording voice chat on Xbox Series X|S that you need to know about. Otherwise, you may be oversold as to how the feature works on your Xbox.</p><p> To be specific, the key aspects and limitations of Xbox’s recording and reporting features for voice chat are as follows:</p><ul><li>Unlike<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/capture-share-screenshots-videos-xbox-series-x/" >capturing videos and screenshots on your Xbox Series X|S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , recording voice chat is not a social feature and is instead aimed at solely tackling toxic online behavior.</li><li>While your Xbox Series X|S does allow you to record voice chat, it does not allow you to record your party chat. The only recordable online voice chats are those found inside in-game lobbies.</li><li>To protect other players’ and your privacy, recording in-game voice chats will only record the most recent 60 seconds of audio and the audio will auto-delete after 24 hours. This way, you don’t have to worry about someone documenting your conversations online.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/stock.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image of a step by step guide to Xbox voice reporting"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/12/xbox-voice-reporting-feature/" >Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Similarly to taking captures on your Xbox Series X|S, recorded voice chats are also saved to your Xbox.

But while you might believe that you’re limited to games in the Steam library, you’re not.</p><p> While the Steam library has a huge collection of games, some titles are only available from third party services, such as Epic Games. Meanwhile, some of your older favorites can probably be found on GOG (formerly known as “Good Old Games”).</p><p> Incredibly, both of these services can be installed.

Unfortunately, this is a tedious process that can take up to an hour to complete.</p><p> In addition, there is an alternative called Lutris (which covers all Linux gaming options).</p><p> Heroic Games Launcher is a simpler approach that enables you to start playing games sooner, rather than later.</p><h2 id="Before-You-Add-Non-Steam-Games-to-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Before-You-Add-Non-Steam-Games-to-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Before You Add Non-Steam Games to Steam Deck"></a>Before You Add Non-Steam Games to Steam Deck</h2><p> Setting up Heroic Games Launcher on Steam Deck is straightforward, but there is something you might want to do first.</p><p> If you’re planning to install extra non-Steam games on Steam Deck,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-microsd-cards-steam-deck/" >consider a microSD card for additional storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . A Class 10 SDXC card is best for this, including any branded for the Nintendo Switch.</p><p> This is a particularly wise idea of you opted for the cheaper 64GB Steam Deck model.</p><p> The main reason for this is that third party games can currently only be stored on the Steam Deck’s internal storage. Consequently, you’ll need to make space by moving large Steam-based games from the internal storage to the microSD card:</p><ol><li>In your Library, use the controls to select the game you wish to move</li><li>Press the<strong>Options</strong> button</li><li>Select<strong>Properties</strong></li><li>Go to<strong>Installed Files</strong><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muo-gaming-steam-deck-gog-epic-games-installed-files.jpeg"                      alt="muo-gaming-steam-deck-gog-epic-games-installed-files"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Move install folder</strong></li><li>In the Move Content screen, highlight<strong>MicroSD Card</strong> and tap<strong>Move</strong><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/muo-gaming-steam-deck-gog-epic-games-sdcard-move.jpeg"                      alt="Move data to the SD card"                ></li><li>Wait while the process completes</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This should provide more space for installing titles from other platforms.

A Steam Deck is capable of running most PC games, including those on Epic Games. You may have noticed some crossover between the Epic Games and the Steam libraries.</p><p> Epic Games has given many games away over the past few years. It’s simple to get<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-free-games-on-the-epic-games-store/" >free games from Epic Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and many gamers have grown a library of such games, preferring this to spending money on the exact same titles on Steam.</p><p> Furthermore, Steam Deck runs a special version of Arch Linux, and has a desktop mode where more games can be installed, if desired. Furthermore, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-steam-proton-how-does-it-run-windows-games-on-steam-deck/" >Proton compatibility layer software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is regularly updated and ensures support for many Windows games.</p><p> In short, it’s completely safe to install non-Steam games on your Steam Deck.</p><p> Before proceeding, you might want to make things easier for yourself by grabbing a USB keyboard and mouse and a USB type-C hub for the Steam Deck.</p><p> While you can use the device’s on-screen keyboard (perhaps the most widely-used<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/steam-deck-shortcuts/" >Steam Deck shortcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , activated with<strong>Steam + X</strong> ), it is far easier to sign in to Epic Games with a physical keyboard.</p><p> Otherwise, you’ll be using the right-hand touchpad as a laptop touchpad to control the mouse pointer on your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id="How-to-Install-Heroic-Games-Launcher-on-Steam-Deck"><a href="#How-to-Install-Heroic-Games-Launcher-on-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="How to Install Heroic Games Launcher on Steam Deck"></a>How to Install Heroic Games Launcher on Steam Deck</h2><p> Start by accessing Steam Deck’s desktop mode.

These computers typically start at $2,000 with no upper limit. So, if that’s what you’re after, let’s compare the top processors from Intel and AMD.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>Cores (Threads)</th><th>Base Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>Turbo Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>L3 Cache (MB)</th><th>Max TDP (W)</th><th>Price</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel Core i9-14900K</strong></td><td>8 (16)</td><td>8 (16)</td><td>3.2</td><td>2.4</td><td>5.8</td><td>4.4</td><td>36</td><td>253</td><td>$589</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</strong></td><td>16 (32)</td><td>4.2</td><td>5.7</td><td>32+96</td><td>120</td><td>$699</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</strong></td><td>12 (24)</td><td>4.4</td><td>5.6</td><td>32+96</td><td>120</td><td>$599</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> When you look at the numbers on paper, the 14900K matches the 7950X3D based on core count. Both AMD chips have a higher base clock speed than Intel’s offering, but Intel beats them with its turbo clock speed. Despite this, the X3D’s massive L3 cache is known to give AMD an advantage in gaming.</p><p> Still, these numbers don’t mean anything in the real world. Unfortunately, we cannot find benchmark results that featured all three processors together, so let’s first see how the 7950X3D compares against the 14900K from<a class="link"   href="http://youtu.be/2MvvCr-thM8" >Gamer Nexus’ test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>Intel Core i9-14900K</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rainbow Six Siege (1440p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>511.2</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td><strong>F1 23 (1440p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>392.8</td><td>400.1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 (1440p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>107.6</td><td>121.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Fantasy XIV (1440p &#x2F; Maximum)</strong></td><td>269</td><td>212.6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Starfield (1080p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>123</td><td>102.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see, there are mixed results between the 14900K and the 7950X3D. While the latter usually performs better, the 14900K gains a massive advantage on a couple of titles.</p><p> Now, let’s see how the 7900X3D performs against its more powerful sibling. Again, we’re using Gamer Nexus’ results, which used the same PC configuration as the previous test.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rainbow Six Siege (1080p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>840.9</td><td>808.6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Fantasy XIV (1080p &#x2F; Maximum)</strong></td><td>255.9</td><td>250.5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (1080p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>382.6</td><td>334.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CSGO (1440p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>383.9</td><td>386.9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 (1080p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>267.6</td><td>255.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Far Cry 6 (1080p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>198.2</td><td>194.7</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Given that the 7950X3D is the faster, more expensive model, it just makes sense that it will perform better than the 7900X3D. But how will the 7900X3D perform against the 14900K? This time, let’s look at the<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlDJfEWohpQ" >results of Mark PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>Intel Core i9-14900K</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>God of War (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>113</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>83</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>123</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Watch Dogs Legion (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>114</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Red Dead Redemption II (4K &#x2F; Favor Quality)</strong></td><td>133</td><td>119</td></tr></tbody></table><p> According to the test results, the 7950X3D is the best performer, but by a small margin over the 14900K. On the other hand, the 14900K easily overcomes the 7900X3D.</p><p> This means AMD is the better option for high-end gaming because of its raw horsepower. However, if you consider the prices of these chips, you might want to choose Intel’s processor instead because it’s the cheapest of the bunch. But does cost really matter at this price point?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Mid-Tier-Gaming-Intel-Core-i7-14700K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D"><a href="#Mid-Tier-Gaming-Intel-Core-i7-14700K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-7800X3D" class="headerlink" title="Mid-Tier Gaming: Intel Core i7-14700K vs. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D"></a>Mid-Tier Gaming: Intel Core i7-14700K vs. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/5c068034f0080166994d164493cb808318b6f6a0f4d45de0f56404a9b7904a53.jpg"                      alt="A Windows gaming PC"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/overweight-man-playing-video-game-at-night-3930073/" >Pexels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Mid-range builds start from $750 to $2,000 and usually use the Intel Core i7-14700K or the AMD Ryzen 7 7800 X3D.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>Cores (Threads)</th><th>Base Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>Turbo Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>L3 Cache (MB)</th><th>Max TDP (W)</th><th>Price</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel Core i7-14700K</strong></td><td>8 (16)</td><td>12 (12)</td><td>3.4</td><td>2.5</td><td>5.6</td><td>4.3</td><td>33</td><td>253</td><td>$409</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</strong></td><td>8 (16)</td><td>4.2</td><td>5.0</td><td>96</td><td>120</td><td>$449</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> If we look at their specifications, we can expect the 14700K to beat the 7800X3D handily with its greater core number and higher turbo clock speed.

Based on the results, there’s no clear winner between both CPU makers. While AMD and Intel are neck-and-neck at the top end of the market, the former demolishes the latter in mid-range gaming—so much so that some high-end gaming PCs use the 7800X3D instead. But when it comes to budget processors, Intel remains king.</p><p> If you’re on a no-holds-barred mission to build the most powerful gaming PC, then yes, AMD is the best gaming CPU. But if you’re looking for a balance between price and power, the line becomes a bit more blurred as you must consider other aspects like your existing system and the compatibility of more affordable parts like DDR4 RAM.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-music-player-software-for-android-for-2024/"><u>[New] Best Music Player Software for Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/new-making-funny-photos-no-fees-involved/"><u>[New] Making Funny Photos No Fees Involved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-eliminate-youtube-shorts-permanent-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Eliminate YouTube Shorts Permanent Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-instagram-video-speed-onlinemobile-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Instagram Video Speed Online/Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-dji-flight-aesthetics-start-with-free-trial-lutts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance DJI Flight Aesthetics – Start With Free Trial LUTTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reviewing-the-core-of-magix-photo-framework/"><u>2024 Approved Reviewing the Core of MAGIX Photo Framework</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/bypass-the-big-apples-social-hierarchy-with-these-tips/"><u>Bypass the Big Apple's Social Hierarchy with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/hidden-dangers-in-linkedins-latest-gaming-feature/"><u>Hidden Dangers in LinkedIn’s Latest Gaming Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/live-laugh-and-stream-with-twitch-app-on-the-go/"><u>Live, Laugh & Stream with Twitch App on the Go</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/overcoming-game-fatigue-6-coping-strategies/"><u>Overcoming Game Fatigue: 6 Coping Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719172972874-psp-reimagined-iphone-edition-now-available/"><u>PSP Reimagined: IPhone Edition Now Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/resolving-offline-friends-error-in-steam/"><u>Resolving Offline Friends Error in Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/testimonial-videos-the-social-proof-powerhouse-for-2024/"><u>Testimonial Videos The Social Proof Powerhouse for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-top-8-apps-for-handling-multiple-phone-ids/"><u>The Ultimate List of Top 8 Apps for Handling Multiple Phone IDs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-picks-discovering-apple-arcades-hidden-gems/"><u>Top Picks: Discovering Apple Arcade's Hidden Gems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-iphone-top-10-solutions-for-sms-not-sending-issues/"><u>Troubleshooting iPhone: Top 10 Solutions for SMS Not Sending Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/virtual-brawl-tech-console-vs-stick-battlegrounds/"><u>Virtual Brawl Tech: Console Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Supercharge-Your-Switch-with-These-Key-Settings"><a href="#Supercharge-Your-Switch-with-These-Key-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Supercharge Your Switch with These Key Settings"></a>Supercharge Your Switch with These Key Settings</h2><p> The Nintendo Switch is already a very user-friendly and convenient console, but there are several settings you might be sleeping on that could make your experience with it even better. None of these settings are activated by default, so if you don’t know about them, you are likely not using your Switch to its full potential.</p><p> If you want to learn how to extend your Switch’s battery life, get faster download speeds, and get better graphics while playing docked, you can find all of that and more below.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves"><a href="#1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Cloud Data Saves"></a>1. Enable Cloud Data Saves</h2><p> Have you ever spent hours on a game and lost all of your progress? This issue is more common than you would think. Whether your Switch gets stolen, you break your console accidentally, or maybe you lend your sibling your Switch, and they accidentally save over your save file. These things are unfortunate, but they can happen, and that can result in hours of progress down the drain.</p><p> If you’ve ever experienced this, you will understand the seven stages of grief that follow, usually culminating in you deciding to ditch the game for good rather than spend countless hours building back up to the point you were at before. All of this can be avoided, however, if you activate Cloud saves on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/save-data-cloud-settings-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Save Data Cloud Settings on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To do so, head to the settings and make your way to<strong>Data Management</strong> . From there, click<strong>Save Data Cloud</strong> and choose your<strong>user profile</strong> . Scroll down to<strong>Settings</strong> at the bottom and turn on<strong>Automatically Back Up Save Data</strong> . Once you have activated this setting, you will be able to retrieve any data you lose. This feature is only available if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</p><h2 id="2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life"><a href="#2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life"></a>2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life</h2><p> Putting your Nintendo Switch in Flight Mode limits your ability to connect to the internet. But if the game you’re currently playing doesn’t use internet, you can save a decent amount of battery life by putting your Switch in Flight Mode even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</p><p> Being connected to the internet and having your console constantly send and receive that signal uses energy. Putting your console in Flight Mode saves valuable resources that, if you’re not using them anyway, are better used elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/flight-mode-menu-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Flight Mode Menu on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To put your phone on Flight Mode. Simply open your settings and scroll down to<strong>Flight Mode</strong> . It’s the second option on the menu and will only take a moment to activate, but could save you precious moments in your game.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch"></a>3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch</h2><p> The Switch doesn’t have a lot of storage space. A Switch Lite, for example, only has 32GB of space available, and a portion of that is reserved for the system. 32GB may sound like a lot, but if you’re looking at downloading big games, even the Switch OLED’s improved 64 GB will quickly disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/quick-archive-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Quick Archive on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Your options here are to buy a large SD card to give your Switch more storage space or juggle your games. If your Switch is full, but you want to download a new game, don’t worry. You don’t have to delete all of your games to make space, you can quickly archive them instead.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-how-to-archive-software/" >Archiving software on your Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> still frees up storage space, but leaves an icon of the game on your home screen, so you can quickly and easily redownload it when you’re ready.</p><h2 id="4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio"><a href="#4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Enable Bluetooth Audio"></a>4. Enable Bluetooth Audio</h2><p> Bluetooth audio wasn’t something the Switch supported at launch, but it was later introduced in a system update. So Switch owners are now able to enjoy all the wonderful sounds of the Switch without the pesky wires.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/activate-bluetooth-audio-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Activate Bluetooth Audio on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Not everyone keeps up to date with the ins and outs of every Nintendo Switch update that comes out. So, if you, like many others, were still unaware of the fact that you could connect Bluetooth headphones to your Switch, this may come as a welcome surprise to you. Connecting and<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-bluetooth-headphones-nintendo-switch/" >using Bluetooth headphones on your Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a simple and easy process that could change the way you listen to your system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Tweak-Your-TV-Resolution-Settings-to-Get-Better-Graphics"><a href="#5-Tweak-Your-TV-Resolution-Settings-to-Get-Better-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="5. Tweak Your TV Resolution Settings to Get Better Graphics"></a>5. Tweak Your TV Resolution Settings to Get Better Graphics</h2><p> One of the most underrated Nintendo Switch settings can actually improve the graphics of your system when you’re playing in docked mode. But like many other settings on this list, it is buried in menus and not easy to find unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Thankfully, you have us to show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tv-resolution-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="TV Resolution on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If your TV is capable of displaying a 1080p image, so is your Nintendo Switch. In handheld mode, the Switch is only capable of 720p, but this can be improved in docked mode. You do have to change your<strong>TV Resolution</strong> setting, however.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/improve-nintendo-switch-docked-graphics/" >Improving your Nintendo Switch’s resolution in docked mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is as easy as heading to your settings, going to<strong>TV Output</strong> , and selecting<strong>1080p</strong> from your<strong>TV Resolution</strong> settings.</p><h2 id="6-Calibrate-Your-Nintendo-Switch-Controllers"><a href="#6-Calibrate-Your-Nintendo-Switch-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="6. Calibrate Your Nintendo Switch Controllers"></a>6. Calibrate Your Nintendo Switch Controllers</h2><p> The Achilles heel of the Nintendo Switch is Joy-Con drift. This is a phenomenon caused by a wearing down of the mechanisms inside the joystick that leads to false input in your controller and makes your character or camera start moving on its own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-calibrate-controller-on-nintendo-switch-calibrate-control-sticks.jpg"                      alt="How to calibrate controller on Nintendo Switch Calibrate Control Sticks"                ></p><p> This issue can cause some serious headaches in-game, but there is a way to fix it (if the case is mild enough.) That is by recalibrating your Joy-Cons or any other controller you may be having issues with. Simply head to your settings, select<strong>Controllers and Sensors</strong> , and press<strong>Calibrate Control Sticks</strong> . The Switch will guide you through the rest of the process, and you should finally experience some relief from drift for a little while, at least.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds"><a href="#7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds" class="headerlink" title="7.

From there, select the Wi-Fi you’re connected to and press<strong>Change Settings</strong> . Then scroll down and bump the<strong>MTU</strong> up from<strong>1400</strong> to<strong>1500</strong> .

There are, of course, some things that even Maintenance Mode cannot help you with, but many software issues can be resolved with a factory reset or even a soft reset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/img06-1.jpg"                      alt="A promotional image of the Maintanance Mode options for Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://www.nintendo.com/my/support/switch/data%5Fmanagement/initialization/index.html" >Nintendo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> To open Maintenance Mode, hold the<strong>volume up + volume down + power buttons</strong> down for a couple of seconds until the system boots up in Maintenance Mode, and you can troubleshoot your Switch from there.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Level-Up-Your-Switch-With-These-Helpful-Switch-Tips"><a href="#Level-Up-Your-Switch-With-These-Helpful-Switch-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Level Up Your Switch With These Helpful Switch Tips"></a>Level Up Your Switch With These Helpful Switch Tips</h2><p> The Switch is a great console already, but if you use any or all of these settings, your experience with your Switch could become even better.

While many are fun and absolutely worth your money, they come with some drawbacks that could prevent you from enjoying your time completely.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Early-Access"><a href="#What-Is-Early-Access" class="headerlink" title="What Is Early Access?"></a>What Is Early Access?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/early-access-section-on-steam-game.JPG"                      alt="Early Access section on Steam game"                ></p><p>Jhet Borja&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Early access games are games that are released before the publishers or developers think it is ready for its official release.</p><p> The reason for this is mostly to gain additional funding from interested players so that the game can continue to be developed. It’s also a great way for players to give feedback, test the game for bugs and problems, and have a hand in the transformation of the game as it approaches its official release.</p><p> Every game goes through a development process, through many versions that could be wildly different to the final version of the game. Some games will begin early access close to a finished state, while some you can play at very early stages with still a lot of work to do.</p><p> Steam is one of the most popular platforms to get early access to many games, but you can also get<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-participate-in-xbox-research-for-xbox-series-xs/" >early access for Xbox games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even Google Play.</p><h2 id="Pro-Contributing-to-the-Development-of-the-Game"><a href="#Pro-Contributing-to-the-Development-of-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Contributing to the Development of the Game"></a>Pro: Contributing to the Development of the Game</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dinkum-gameplay.jpg"                      alt="Dinkum gameplay"                ></p><p> Early access games usually allow players to have an active role in how the game transforms. Players can often join Discord servers where the developers are easily accessible and their concerns, feedback, bug reports, and suggestions can all be taken seriously.</p><p> My favorite example of this is Dinkum. It’s a farm builder similar to Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, but with a lot of Australian personality. It’s developed by one person and it has a busy and active Discord server where your concerns can be seen directly by the developer.</p><p> Dinkum has grown to be an awesome game and it is partially thanks to early access. It not only gained funding, but also real player testing and feedback.</p><h2 id="Con-The-Game-Might-Be-in-Early-Access-Limbo"><a href="#Con-The-Game-Might-Be-in-Early-Access-Limbo" class="headerlink" title="Con: The Game Might Be in Early Access Limbo"></a>Con: The Game Might Be in Early Access Limbo</h2><p> Some games take forever to reach their official release stage. BeamNG.drive is one example that’s been in early access since 2015. Of course, the game has transformed so much since its early days that it’s starting to be recognized as one of the best rally simulators, but the game itself is still very reliant on community-created mods, maps, cars, and plugins.</p><p> It’s more like a racing simulator sandbox than a standalone game that you can enjoy without downloading anything else.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148639/16836" target="_top" id="2148639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148639/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Buggy"><a href="#Con-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Buggy" class="headerlink" title="Con: Early Access Games Are Usually Buggy"></a>Con: Early Access Games Are Usually Buggy</h2><p> Of course, releasing a game that isn’t ready for official release is going to have problems. Depending on how far along the game is, you could experience game-breaking bugs, performance issues, and inconveniences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/valheim-store-page-on-steam.png"                      alt="valheim store page on steam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Valheim was released in a pretty early state. While you were able to complete the game, there were many features that the developers still wanted to implement. The building mechanics were frustrating and limiting, and the spider biome was still completely empty. My friends and I also faced frequent crashes and connection issues despite having no connection issues on any of our computers.</p><p> Despite those issues, it was still a wonderfully fun game that we put 90 hours into within just a week and we only looked forward to how the game would improve over time.</p><h2 id="Pro-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Cheaper"><a href="#Pro-Early-Access-Games-Are-Usually-Cheaper" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Early Access Games Are Usually Cheaper"></a>Pro: Early Access Games Are Usually Cheaper</h2><p> While it’s not always the case, there have been many times where early access prices are lower than the release price.</p><p> Developers often won’t justify putting up a high price for a game that’s still not complete, so in exchange for your early investment into their project, you’ll pay a lower price. Early access players will sometimes even be given special items or cosmetics to signify their support for the game before its release.</p><p> However, there are cases where the price goes down after release. This could be to gain more sales, or because early access players have given feedback about the price. Either way the price goes, you should only buy it if you think it’s worth it.</p><p> Thankfully<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-refund-a-game-on-steam/" >Steam refunds are pretty easy to do <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ; so long as your playtime is less than 2 hours or you’ve owned the game for less than 14 days, you can refund it.</p><h2 id="Con-Incomplete-Story-World-Mechanics"><a href="#Con-Incomplete-Story-World-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Con: Incomplete Story&#x2F;World&#x2F;Mechanics"></a>Con: Incomplete Story&#x2F;World&#x2F;Mechanics</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/wide-view-of-palworld-world.jpg"                      alt="Wide view of Palworld world"                ></p><p> If the game was ready to go, it wouldn’t be in early access now would it? You’re very likely to experience many features missing, from plots, places, or even whole mechanics.</p><p> Palworld is a great example of that. It was released and became a massive success, but only had the bare essentials. There were just a few small islands to roam around, repetitive elements, missing bosses, and a lot of in-progress features.</p><p> You’re often left waiting until the updates roll out to get more of what you were promised. This is usually why games like Palworld have a very steep drop in player count after a few weeks. Without many of the features that would’ve kept players busy and having fun, it’s easy to feel like there’s nothing more to the game except waiting for future updates.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pro-Experiencing-the-Game’s-Transformation"><a href="#Pro-Experiencing-the-Game’s-Transformation" class="headerlink" title="Pro: Experiencing the Game’s Transformation"></a>Pro: Experiencing the Game’s Transformation</h2><p> While you should know that you’re paying for something that’s incomplete, it should still be worth it if you enjoy it.</p><p> It’s always very exciting to hear about a huge update coming to the games you enjoy, adding whole new ways to play the game, story progression, or even whole new worlds. It’s almost as if you’re getting a new game without needing to pay anymore. It’s also partially thanks to your purchase and contribution that the game is able to progress.</p><p> Rust, Valheim, BeamNG.drive, Baldur’s Gate 3, and other games have transformed so much since their first early access release. Of course, games can still drastically change over time even after official release, but when it comes to early access, you get to see that on a faster time scale.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-The-Game-May-Become-Unrecognizable"><a href="#Con-The-Game-May-Become-Unrecognizable" class="headerlink" title="Con: The Game May Become Unrecognizable"></a>Con: The Game May Become Unrecognizable</h2><p> A game’s transformation may be a blessing or a curse depending on what you’re looking for and what the publishers and developers eventually decide to do. Some games may end up greedier than they started off, with way more microtransactions added to the game or even just a change in direction.</p><p> The game you used to enjoy playing might be completely different in a bad way and not what you paid for.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1013424/11832" target="_top" id="1013424">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1013424" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1013424/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Con-Risk-of-Abandonment"><a href="#Con-Risk-of-Abandonment" class="headerlink" title="Con: Risk of Abandonment"></a>Con: Risk of Abandonment</h2><p> While officially released games do get abandoned, the risk of abandonment for early access games is a bit higher. There are many reasons for this, but there are a few red flags to watch out for.</p><p> If a game releases in early access as a last-ditch effort to get funding, it’s already at a very high risk of getting abandoned, especially if not many buy the game. Indie releases with solo developers also get abandoned pretty often because it’s hard to live off of a game unless it’s a massive success.</p><p> However, there are also green flags to watch out for if you want to know if the risk is low: busy communities, developers constantly talking about and delivering updates, clear development roadmaps, and of course, popularity with lots of players buying the game.</p><p> With more and more games opting to go early access, you should always keep in mind if it’s worth its price or not. Ask yourself if you would pay the amount they’re asking for despite the game not being in its best state, whether it’s worth waiting for those updates, or if you can afford to lose what you spent. What matters the most is that you enjoy what you paid for.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-craft-the-perfect-stream-a-comprehensive-guide-to-youtubes-full-rotation-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Craft the Perfect Stream A Comprehensive Guide to YouTube’s Full-Rotation Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/elevate-your-play-establishing-a-4k-environment-on-xbox-series-x/"><u>Elevate Your Play: Establishing a 4K Environment on Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/embark-on-virtual-journeys-game-edition/"><u>Embark on Virtual Journeys - Game Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/exclusive-portable-power-stations-for-gaming/"><u>Exclusive Portable Power Stations for Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-do-you-play-mkv-files-on-samsung-galaxy-a05s-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/"><u>How do you play MKV files on Samsung Galaxy A05s?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-life360-on-windows-pc-for-infinix-smart-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Infinix Smart 8? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/immersive-cinematography-anchors-for-2024/"><u>Immersive Cinematography Anchors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-the-required-apple-store-verification-for-iphone-7-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass the Required Apple Store Verification For iPhone 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-best-of-both-worlds-top-split-screen-video-editing-apps-for-ios-and-android/"><u>New In 2024, The Best of Both Worlds Top Split-Screen Video Editing Apps for iOS & Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/1719577245493-the-fastest-way-to-learn-korean-at-home-choose-wisely/"><u>The Fastest Way to Learn Korean at Home – Choose Wisely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/top-screen-capture-contenders-a-comprehensive-review-for-2024/"><u>Top Screen Capture Contenders A Comprehensive Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/troubleshoot-and-fix-directx-glitches-in-fifa-19-without-hassle/"><u>Troubleshoot and Fix DirectX Glitches in FIFA 19 Without Hassle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/1719165858880-unleash-your-inner-hero-in-the-ultimate-free-game-collection/"><u>Unleash Your Inner Hero in The Ultimate Free Game Collection!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlock-hidden-gems-with-2p-minecraft-on-switch/"><u>Unlock Hidden Gems with 2P Minecraft on Switch</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Now you no longer have to leave the comfort of your seat to do it. That’s right, you can update your PS5 controller wirelessly, and we’re going to show you how to do it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Update-Your-PS5"><a href="#1-Update-Your-PS5" class="headerlink" title="1.

So, if you haven’t done so lately, make sure to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-ps5/" >update your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Go to the Controller Settings Screen</h2><p> Once you update your PS5, and it grabs the latest controller update from Sony’s servers, you should be able to update your controller right from the Home Screen when you boot up your console. Once the prompt comes up, all you have to do is select<strong>Update Now</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/10/prompt-to-update-dualsense-controller-on-ps5.jpg"                      alt="the prompt to update DualSense controller on PS5"                ></p><p> If someone else is using your console, or you weren’t paying attention, the<strong>Notify After 24 Hours</strong> option might have been selected.

Since this is not a full system software update, the process will only take a few seconds to complete. If you find that the<strong>Update</strong> option is grayed out, connect your PS5 controller to the console with a USB-C cable and update it the old way. The next time, your controller will be able to update wirelessly.</p><p> We recommend you install PS5 controller updates the moment they’re available or when you experience issues with your DualSense (it’s actually one of the ways to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-drifting-ps5-dualsense-controller/" >fix PS5 controller drift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Updating-Your-DualSense-Controller-Has-Never-Been-Easier"><a href="#Updating-Your-DualSense-Controller-Has-Never-Been-Easier" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your DualSense Controller Has Never Been Easier"></a>Updating Your DualSense Controller Has Never Been Easier</h2><p> It can be annoying to have to sit comfortably on your chair, boot up your PS5, and then have to get up again to plug your controller in just because you have been notified of an update.

But you might find persistent vibration features more abrasive than complimentary.</p><p> Luckily, with Xbox Series X|S, you can enable and disable controller vibration for your Xbox Wireless Controllers whenever you see fit. So even if a game requires vibration, and you disable the feature, you can always switch it back on. But how do you universally turn controller vibration on or off for Xbox Series X|S? Let’s take a look.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Turning-Off-Vibration-on-Xbox"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-Before-Turning-Off-Vibration-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know Before Turning Off Vibration on Xbox"></a>What You Need to Know Before Turning Off Vibration on Xbox</h2><p> Generally, turning off controller vibration for your Xbox controllers is quite simple, but it comes with a few caveats you should be aware of:</p><ul><li>By universally turning off controller vibration, any supported controller could be affected, even if you use a third-party controller. However, because of the variations of third-party controllers, you may not be able to alter and customize it in the same way as an Xbox Wireless Controller.</li><li>As mentioned, some games may rely on controller vibration for gameplay mechanics or even ways of solving puzzles. Because of this, you may need to retroactively alter controller vibration based on the game you are playing.</li><li>Universally turning off controller vibration affects your controller<strong>Profile</strong> . This means that vibration will remain off even if you replace your controller, as your Xbox will automatically utilize the same<strong>Profile</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/controller-profile.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of an Xbox Wireless Controller Profile on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But aside from the practical caveats of altering controller vibration, the most common way you might otherwise be hindered is due to physical issues with a controller.
