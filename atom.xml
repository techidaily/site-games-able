    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Testing-the-New-Switch-OLED-in-a-Classic-Gaming-Setup"><a href="#Testing-the-New-Switch-OLED-in-a-Classic-Gaming-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Testing the New Switch OLED in a Classic Gaming Setup"></a>Testing the New Switch OLED in a Classic Gaming Setup</h2><p> So you’ve made the decision to upgrade from the original Nintendo Switch to the Nintendo Switch OLED. It might be tempting to shove all your old Nintendo Switch accessories in the back of your closet and begin your new life with your Switch, but don’t throw your old dock away! It can still be useful to you.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Does-the-Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Work-With-the-Old-Dock"><a href="#Does-the-Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Work-With-the-Old-Dock" class="headerlink" title="Does the Nintendo Switch OLED Work With the Old Dock?"></a>Does the Nintendo Switch OLED Work With the Old Dock?</h2><p> The short answer is yes! You can still use your Nintendo Switch OLED with your old Nintendo Switch docking station. It might not have the shiny new white coat of paint or a LAN port, but it will still fulfill its duties of streaming your Nintendo Switch gameplay to your TV.</p><p> If you<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-vs-switch-oled-model/" >compare the Nintendo Switch OLED to the original Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the former holds many advantages. In terms of shape and size, however, they are almost identical. At first glance, both systems look the same, but the Nintendo Switch OLED is a fraction of an inch wider than its predecessor.</p><p> But apart from the size and obvious screen upgrade, that’s more-or-less where the physical differences between the two systems end. Both Switch models have the same charging port, which is how the Switch connects to the dock. That means that your old dock will still connect to your new OLED Switch without any problems, and vice versa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-In-Old-Dock.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch OLED In Old Dock"                ></p><p> The Nintendo Switch docking station has an open design, so the size difference doesn’t matter either. Your Nintendo Switch OLED will still fit snuggly inside your old dock.</p><p> The Nintendo Switch OLED’s upgraded screen makes gameplay look incredible when you’re playing handheld. There are, however, a few settings you can change to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/improve-nintendo-switch-docked-graphics/" >improve your Nintendo Switch graphics while docked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so your game can look just as good on your TV as it does in your hands.</p><p> All Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons are also compatible with both models, so you might want to refrain from throwing those into the depths of your closet as well. The white Joy-Cons that come with the Nintendo Switch OLED are exactly the same as those of the original Nintendo Switch. This means you can still mix and match your Joy-Cons to switch up your color scheme, or play multiplayer with a friend on a new OLED with your old Joy-Cons.</p><h2 id="Are-There-Any-Old-Switch-Accessories-I-Can’t-Use-With-the-Nintendo-Switch-OLED"><a href="#Are-There-Any-Old-Switch-Accessories-I-Can’t-Use-With-the-Nintendo-Switch-OLED" class="headerlink" title="Are There Any Old Switch Accessories I Can’t Use With the Nintendo Switch OLED?"></a>Are There Any Old Switch Accessories I Can’t Use With the Nintendo Switch OLED?</h2><p> While you can still use your old docking station and Joy-Cons, some other accessories might not work with the Nintendo Switch OLED. Aside from being 1cm larger, the buttons along the top of the Switch and game card slot have a slightly different layout.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nintendo-Switch-Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Comparison.jpg"                      alt="Nintendo Switch Nintendo Switch OLED Comparison"                ></p><p> This means that hardcover protective cases and grips that are made to fit the original Nintendo Switch will not be compatible with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. There are also some Nintendo LABO kits that won’t be able to accommodate the Nintendo OLED’s wider size.</p><h2 id="Keep-Hold-of-Your-Original-Nintendo-Switch-Dock"><a href="#Keep-Hold-of-Your-Original-Nintendo-Switch-Dock" class="headerlink" title="Keep Hold of Your Original Nintendo Switch Dock"></a>Keep Hold of Your Original Nintendo Switch Dock</h2><p> While the Nintendo Switch OLED docking station might have all the bells and whistles, you can still rely on your original dock to do the job.</p><p> To make the most out of your Nintendo Switch gaming sessions, set your old dock up in another room, so you don’t have to unplug and move it every time you want to game on the big screen.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-harmonizing-hues-3-swift-strategies-for-perfect-color-balance/"><u>[New] Harmonizing Hues 3 Swift Strategies for Perfect Color Balance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2023s-best-mobile-emulators-top-choices-for-your-classic-psp-adventures/"><u>2023'S Best Mobile Emulators Top Choices for Your Classic PSP Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-kinemaster-app-for-android-complete-review/"><u>2024 Approved KineMaster App for Android - Complete Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-mastering-ipogo-for-pokemon-go-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering iPogo for Pokémon GO On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/drive-efficiency-forward-hotkeys-for-fast-clicking/"><u>Drive Efficiency Forward: Hotkeys for Fast Clicking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-your-console-experience-with-nvidia-new-app/"><u>Enhance Your Console Experience With Nvidia New App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/from-steam-engines-to-ai-the-11-major-tech-milestnests-since-1844/"><u>From Steam Engines to AI: The 11 Major Tech Milestnests Since 1844</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/google-home-device-unpairing-tutorial-how-to-for-a-cleaner-smart-home-setup/"><u>Google Home Device Unpairing Tutorial: How-To for a Cleaner Smart Home Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-review-and-guide-to-techeligible-frp-bypass-and-more-for-nokia-c12-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Review & Guide to Techeligible FRP Bypass and More For Nokia C12 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/rally-the-friends-unveiling-the-most-exciting-sports-apps-iosandroid/"><u>Rally the Friends: Unveiling the Most Exciting Sports Apps (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-best-logitech-gaming-mice/"><u>The Best Logitech Gaming Mice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-experts-look-at-choosing-superior-discords/"><u>The Expert's Look at Choosing Superior Discords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-sound-journey-with-mmx-200/"><u>The Ultimate Sound Journey with MMX 200</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ultimate-oculus-gaming-guide-best-selling-choices/"><u>Ultimate Oculus Gaming Guide Best-Selling Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/uncover-chatgpts-hidden-game-treasures-the-best-6/"><u>Uncover ChatGPT's Hidden Game Treasures - The Best 6!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-game-controls-xbox-controller-for-pc-connection-147-chars/"><u>Unlocking Game Controls: Xbox Controller for PC Connection (147 Chars)</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123469/16836" target="_top" id="2123469">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123469" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123469/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Navigate-the-Price-Rise-on-Xbox-Gold-Membership-Swiftly"><a href="#Navigate-the-Price-Rise-on-Xbox-Gold-Membership-Swiftly" class="headerlink" title="Navigate the Price Rise on Xbox Gold Membership Swiftly"></a>Navigate the Price Rise on Xbox Gold Membership Swiftly</h2><p> Everyone loves a good deal. And as good of a deal as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate already is, it’s hard to say “no” to utilizing a loophole to unlock Game Pass Ultimate at an even cheaper rate. If you purchase and prepay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription and then upgrade that to an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you can end up paying just $8.20 per month instead of the usual $17.00 for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for up to 24 months.</p><p>Interested? Here is how you can take advantage of this epic deal.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-Does-This-Xbox-Live-Gold-Hack-Work"><a href="#How-Does-This-Xbox-Live-Gold-Hack-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does This Xbox Live Gold Hack Work?"></a>How Does This Xbox Live Gold Hack Work?</h2><p> So the gist of this deal is that if you already have an Xbox Live Gold subscription, you can upgrade and convert that into an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. You can prepay and convert up to 36 months max.</p><p> For example, if you prepaid for one year of Xbox Live Gold and purchase just one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the remaining 12 months will be upgraded to Ultimate. Xbox Live Gold is significantly cheaper than Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, yet your prepaid subscription will be upgraded free of charge.</p><p> This conversion used to be a 1:1 ratio, meaning you got the exact amount of prepaid time converted to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Since the price upgrades of Xbox Game Pass memberships, however, the ratio has now changed to 3:2, so you don’t get quite as many months of discounted Ultimate as you did before. This is a shame, but inevitable considering there are several<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-xbox-game-pass-will-get-more-expensive/" >reasons why Xbox Game Pass will get more expensive over time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/game-pass-core-announcement.jpg"                      alt="A hero image and headline for an Xbox announcement about Game Pass Core"                ></p><p> Xbox Live Gold’s days are limited, and it will be replaced with a new service called Xbox Game Pass Core on September 14, 2023. There is absolutely no guarantee that the conversion hack will still work when Xbox Game Pass Core is introduced, so make sure you jump on this offer as soon as you can to get the most out of it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Money-on-Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-With-the-Xbox-Live-Gold-Hack"><a href="#How-to-Save-Money-on-Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-With-the-Xbox-Live-Gold-Hack" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Money on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With the Xbox Live Gold Hack"></a>How to Save Money on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With the Xbox Live Gold Hack</h2><p> The key to making the most of this offer is prepaying for as much Xbox Live Gold as you possibly can. By default, you can only prepay for three months of Xbox Live Gold at once, but we have yet another loophole to share with you, and that is digital codes. As of 2020, you can no longer purchase digital codes for Xbox Live Gold directly from Microsoft’s website. You can, however, still find them on third-party websites such as Amazon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xbox-live-gold-memberships-for-sale-on-amazon.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Live Gold Memberships for Sale on Amazon"                ></p><p> If you want to take advantage of the maximum 36-month deal, purchase three 12-month digital codes for Xbox Live Gold. You can pick these up on Amazon for around $60.00 each, sometimes cheaper. Once you have your digital codes, head to<a class="link"   href="https://redeem.microsoft.com/" >redeem.microsoft.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to redeem them.</p><p> If you’re opting for the full 36-month hack, it’s important that you don’t choose to turn on recurring billing when you’re redeeming your codes. Sometimes Xbox offers an extra month as an incentive to continue your subscription, and since you need 36 months exactly, this can mess up your total and could lead to you not being able to redeem your final code.</p><p> After banking 36 months of Xbox Live Gold or however much you can afford, purchase one month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass/ultimate" >Xbox website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After entering your payment information, you will see a text box explaining that your remaining Xbox Live Gold months will be upgraded to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a 3:2 ratio. This means that if you had 36 months (or three years) of Xbox Live Gold in your bank, you will only get two years of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate in return.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-conversion-agreement.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Conversion Agreement"                ></p><p> This is a bit of a shame. But even with the new 3:2 conversion, you can still unlock a massive discount compared to paying for a standard Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for two years.</p><p> If you are keen to do this but already have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-cancel-your-xbox-game-pass-subscription/" >cancel your Xbox Game Pass subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , wait for your remaining month to run out, and then perform this hack. Make sure you act quickly, though, and get it done before Xbox Live Gold is gone.</p><h2 id="Jump-on-This-Offer-Before-It’s-Too-Late"><a href="#Jump-on-This-Offer-Before-It’s-Too-Late" class="headerlink" title="Jump on This Offer Before It’s Too Late"></a>Jump on This Offer Before It’s Too Late</h2><p> There is a high likelihood that this offer will die along with Xbox Live Gold on September 14th, 2023. If you want to enjoy all the newest Xbox-exclusive titles, like Starfield, as well as the hundreds of other games on offer at a heavy discount, go ahead and convert your Xbox Live Gold subscription to an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate one ASAP.</p><p> There is a slim chance you might still be able to utilize this offer with Xbox Game Pass Core, but that has not been confirmed in the slightest, so waiting is not worth the risk. Take this as your sign to secure your Xbox Game Pass Ultimate discount before September 14th!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximize-productivity-with-zoom-scheduling-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximize Productivity with Zoom Scheduling Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-30-affordable-and-robust-cloud-services-with-up-to-1tb-space/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top 30 Affordable & Robust Cloud Services with Up to 1TB Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-which-video-editor-wins-filmora-or-democreator-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Which Video Editor Wins?

With Xbox Series X, you can guarantee you can reach native 4K gaming with just a few steps. But how do you enable native 4K Xbox gaming? Let’s find out.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Check-if-You-Can-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#How-to-Check-if-You-Can-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Check if You Can Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X"></a>How to Check if You Can Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X</h2><p> To be able to game with native 4K visuals on Xbox Series X, your setup needs to meet a few specifications. In other words, you need 4K compatible devices to enable the feature on your Xbox. Specifically, your Xbox setup needs to include the following:</p><ul><li>An Xbox Series X console.</li><li>A TV that supports HDMI 2.1.</li><li>An HDMI 2.1 cable that connects your console to your TV.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/feature-1.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of someone holding an Xbox Wireless Controller in front of a monitor"                ></p><p> Luckily, the standard HDMI cable that comes with your Series X is HDMI 2.1, but if you have had to replace your cable, you will need to ensure you replace it with another HDMI 2.1 cable to guarantee 4K gaming. If you want to check whether your setup is correct, you can use your Xbox Series X to do so by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Press the<strong>Xbox button</strong> to open the Guide menu on your Xbox Series X.</li><li>Highlight<strong>Profile &amp; system</strong> , and select<strong>Settings</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xbox-guide-menu.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Guide menu on Xbox Series X with the options for Profile and System highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Under<strong>General</strong> , select<strong>TV &amp; display options</strong> .</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tv-and-display-options.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the General settings on Xbox Series X with TV and Display Options highlighted"                ></p><ul><li>Select<strong>4K TV details</strong> .</li></ul><p> From<strong>4K TV details</strong> , your Xbox will list every requisite your setup meets when it comes to 4K compatibility. From here you can tell whether your setup is capable of native 4K gaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-3179.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the 4K TV Details screen on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> Unfortunately, if you own an Xbox Series S, you will not be able to reach native 4K regardless of your setup. Alternatively, you can use one of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/xbox-series-s-features-all-users-should-use/" >the best features of the Xbox Series S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , upscaled graphics, and emulate 4K gaming, but it won’t be native.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#How-to-Enable-4K-Gaming-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X"></a>How to Enable 4K Gaming on Your Xbox Series X</h2><p> Irritatingly, 4K is sometimes not automatically enabled on your Xbox Series X, even if your setup meets all the requirements. This is especially true if you have just altered your setup in some way to meet the specifications of 4K gaming.</p><p> And with 4K gaming being one of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/first-things-to-do-with-xbox-series-x/" >the first things Xbox Series X gamers should take advantage of <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ensuring you have enabled 4K is a simple but essential step in improving your Xbox gaming experience.

If you want to push the boat even further, you can also select<strong>Refresh rate</strong> and set it to<strong>120Hz</strong> . This way, you are utilizing your Xbox’s visuals to the max, just as long as your setup supports it.</p><h2 id="Game-With-Native-4K-Visuals-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Game-With-Native-4K-Visuals-on-Your-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Game With Native 4K Visuals on Your Xbox Series X"></a>Game With Native 4K Visuals on Your Xbox Series X</h2><p> With your gaming setup and Xbox Series X optimized for native 4K gaming, and with the feature manually enabled, you should see a massive visual improvement in supported games you play.</p><p> And with consoles like the Xbox Series S still unable to reach native 4K visuals, optimizing your setup in such a way is a stand-out feature of the powerhouse consoles of the Xbox Series X’s generation. So, whether you want to make the most of your Xbox or the games you want to play, 4K will help to elevate your console experience.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-customizing-ae-title-designs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Customizing AE Title Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-tiktok-livestream-immersion-your-playbook-for-2024/"><u>[New] TikTok Livestream Immersion Your Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ogic-path-top-10-pioneers-in-virtual-practice-for-2024/"><u>[New] Yogic Path Top 10 Pioneers in Virtual Practice for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-perfect-planning-how-to-schedule-your-online-teams-virtual-gatherings-google/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Perfect Planning How to Schedule Your Online Team's Virtual Gatherings (Google)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-get-your-stream-on-point-with-these-top-webcams-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Get Your Stream on Point with These Top Webcams for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/discover-the-ease-of-connecting-your-xbox-controller-to-a-computer-156-chars/"><u>Discover the Ease of Connecting Your Xbox Controller to a Computer (156 Chars)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/enhance-gameplay-with-internationalized-rom-tweaks/"><u>Enhance Gameplay with Internationalized ROM Tweaks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-pictures-from-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How to recover deleted pictures from OnePlus Nord N30 5G.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-music-from-xiaomi-13t-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Music from Xiaomi 13T to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/is-ps5-a-smart-buy-consider-these-4-alternatives/"><u>Is PS5 a Smart Buy?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevating-the-Gaming-Experience-Four-Upgrades-for-Xbox-Points"><a href="#Elevating-the-Gaming-Experience-Four-Upgrades-for-Xbox-Points" class="headerlink" title="Elevating the Gaming Experience: Four Upgrades for Xbox Points"></a>Elevating the Gaming Experience: Four Upgrades for Xbox Points</h2><p> Microsoft Reward Points are supposed to be an added bonus if you decide to buy an Xbox console. And while the reward system is free, you might encounter a few frustrations when attempting to use the service on Xbox Series X|S.</p><p> And as time has passed, Microsoft Reward Points have worsened. However, if Microsoft was to address these issues, it could be a viable facet of your Xbox experience. But what issues with Microsoft Reward Points need addressing? Let’s take a look.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Earning-Microsoft-Reward-Points-Is-Painstakingly-Slow-on-Xbox"><a href="#1-Earning-Microsoft-Reward-Points-Is-Painstakingly-Slow-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="1. Earning Microsoft Reward Points Is Painstakingly Slow on Xbox"></a>1. Earning Microsoft Reward Points Is Painstakingly Slow on Xbox</h2><p> A vital flaw with Microsoft Reward Points is how the system progresses you towards a desired reward at a snail’s pace, especially on Xbox Series X|S.</p><p> Nearly all the ways you can earn Microsoft Reward Points on Xbox will only give you a couple of Reward Points. Even if you focus on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/earn-microsoft-reward-points-quickly/" >quickly earning Microsoft Reward Points <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , methods like completing activities usually only give you five or 15 Reward Points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/activities.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Your Activities section of Microsoft Rewards on Xbox with Activities highlighted"                ></p><p> And even if you complete the more substantial weekly and monthly activities on Xbox that can earn you 100 or 1000 Rewards Points, you’re capped at only being able to earn the points once every week or month. Take this into account with a single month of Xbox Live Gold costing 7000 points, and that’s a lot of weeks.</p><p> So while there may be ways to quickly earn Microsoft Reward Points, readily available rewards earn few points, while heavy-earners are time-capped. This combination creates a timely and frustrating cycle for the service where you can only redeem a reward after months and months of earning.</p><h2 id="2-Xbox-Monthly-and-Weekly-Rewards-Are-Getting-Worse"><a href="#2-Xbox-Monthly-and-Weekly-Rewards-Are-Getting-Worse" class="headerlink" title="2. Xbox Monthly and Weekly Rewards Are Getting Worse"></a>2. Xbox Monthly and Weekly Rewards Are Getting Worse</h2><p> While the monthly and weekly reward activities provide a substantial amount of points for you to earn, it’s not only the time restraints of these activities that hold back the service as a whole.</p><p> Historically, the monthly bonus activities for Microsoft Reward Points would provide you with 2000 points. This represented the best way for you to etch closer to being able to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-redeem-microsoft-reward-points-on-xbox-series-xs/" >redeem your Reward Points on Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a substantial reward. But from the<strong>July monthly bonus round</strong> in 2023, the rewarded points dropped to 1000.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monthly-rewards.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the July Monthly Bonus Round for Microsoft Rewards on Xbox"                ></p><p> The biggest issue associated with the monthly bonus activities was its capped time frame, forcing you to earn the associated points once a month. But now, with the rewarded points literally slashed in half, the feature becomes even more frustrating.</p><p> And with the slashing of points, existing issues are only exacerbated. Together with the sluggish rate you gather points, the unfortunate changes only give you further cause to ignore the feature altogether.</p><h2 id="3-Point-Values-Are-Worth-Less-When-Spending-Points-on-Xbox"><a href="#3-Point-Values-Are-Worth-Less-When-Spending-Points-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="3. Point Values Are Worth Less When Spending Points on Xbox"></a>3. Point Values Are Worth Less When Spending Points on Xbox</h2><p> Aside from how Microsoft Reward Points have adapted over time, some core features of the service represent glaring ways it could be fairer to gamers.</p><p> For instance, Xbox gives you one reward point per dollar you spend on the Xbox Store. If you were to buy a game digitally for $69.99 dollars, you would earn 69 Microsoft Reward Points. But while this system may seem useful at first glance, when compared to the points system as a whole a few problems arise.</p><p> The most consistent Xbox rewards through Microsoft Reward Points provide free months of Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass. But generally, these rewards cost well over 5000 points. So, you would need to purchase over 70 games at retail just to hit the 5000-point requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/point-messages.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of Xbox messages detailing earned Reward Points for purchases made on the Xbox Store"                ></p><p> To put it in plainer terms, if you go off Microsoft’s one-point-per-dollar system, 7000 points for a free month of Xbox Live Gold represents $7000 dollars worth of store purchases. And while this is slightly contrary, it would be ridiculous if points given were equivalent to store purchases, the system seems highly unfair.</p><p> If the ratio of earned points to store purchases were more substantial, the method would seem like a legitimate way for you to attain free rewards on Xbox. But as it is, the system seems almost frugal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134249/18498" target="_top" id="2134249">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134249" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134249/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-The-Best-Ways-to-Earn-Points-Involve-Purchasing-Xbox-Games"><a href="#4-The-Best-Ways-to-Earn-Points-Involve-Purchasing-Xbox-Games" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Best Ways to Earn Points Involve Purchasing Xbox Games</h2><p> Even if you look outside the traditional ways you earn Microsoft Reward Points, other methods involving specific titles can act as Xbox Game Pass advertisements or represent a game you may need to purchase.</p><p> Disregarding the weekly and monthly activities you can engage in, the section for<strong>Your offers</strong> on the Microsoft Rewards on Xbox app displays many other ways to earn points. Often this section will provide you with activities linked to a specific game. For these activities, you need to complete tasks within a game to earn points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/punch-card-rewards.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of a punch card within the Microsoft Rewards on Xbox application highlighting the rewards and requirements screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> This method of incentivizing playing games can be great if you already own the game or can access the title through Xbox Game Pass. But if the required game isn’t available, or you don’t have Game Pass, you have to purchase the game to earn points.</p><p> In terms of offering a useful way to earn points, game-specific activities are great on paper but quickly turn into a way for Microsoft Rewards Points to advertise store purchases or Xbox Game Pass.

It’s an excellent avenue for their imagination and a great way for them to develop certain mental and motor skills. That’s why they could be attracted to playing video games on the PS5.</p><p> However, just like every other means of entertainment, it might contain inappropriate content. But don’t let that stop you from letting them play on the PS5. Instead, you should establish some protective settings on the PS5 to shield your child and monitor their activities.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Create-and-Add-a-Child-Account"><a href="#1-Create-and-Add-a-Child-Account" class="headerlink" title="1. Create and Add a Child Account"></a>1. Create and Add a Child Account</h2><p> First, you should create a child account for your minor and add that account to the PS5. This account will set the default content restriction based on the age of the account user.</p><p> As an adult, you must first have your own PSN account. If you don’t have one, you can read our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-playstation-network-account/" >how to create a PSN account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for assistance. You’ll also need a valid credit or debit card and an email address for your child.</p><p>Here’s how to set up a child account:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings</strong> (the top-right gear icon) and choose<strong>Family and Parental Controls</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Family Management</strong> and log into your PSN account.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/add-family-member-page-on-the-ps5-with-a-qr-code.JPG"                      alt="Add Family Member page on the PS5 with a QR Code"                ></li><li>After you’re logged in, scan the QR code to add a family member using your phone. Alternatively, you can visit the<a class="link"   href="https://www.playstation.com/acct/family" >PSN family management page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer.</li><li>Choose<strong>Set Up Now</strong> and select<strong>Add a Child</strong> .</li><li>Enter the child’s birthday.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/add-a-child-sub-window-on-the-psn-website.jpeg"                      alt="Add a Child sub-window on the PSN website"                ></li><li>Sony will ask you to pay $0.50 to confirm you’re an adult. You need only pay this once—even for adding subsequent kids—and Sony will credit your PlayStation wallet with the $0.50. If you’ve never added a payment method to PSN, read our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/add-psn-wallet-funds-and-buy-games-on-ps5/" >adding funds and buying games on the PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Enter an email address and password for the account.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/add-a-child-sub-window-asking-for-an-email-address-and-password.jpeg"                      alt="Add a Child sub-window asking for an email address and password"                ></li><li>Choose<strong>Confirm</strong> on each page till you finish.</li></ol><p> You don’t need to worry about all the options you see while setting up the child account. You can always change it from the PSN Family panel or from the<strong>Family and Parental Controls</strong> section of the PS5’s settings.</p><p> Next, you have to add the child to your PS5. To do that, you must<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-a-new-ps5-user-and-guest-account/" >create an account on your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> using the email you provided for the child.</p><h2 id="2-Use-Preset-or-Custom-Content-Restriction-Levels"><a href="#2-Use-Preset-or-Custom-Content-Restriction-Levels" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Preset or Custom Content Restriction Levels"></a>2. Use Preset or Custom Content Restriction Levels</h2><p> Now you have a child account added to the PS5; you can set the restriction level you want.</p><p>Follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings &gt; Family and Parental Controls</strong> , choose your child’s account from the list, and select<strong>Parental Controls</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/family-management-page-for-a-child-account-on-the-ps5.JPG"                      alt="Family Management page for a child account on the PS5"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Restriction level</strong> and choose a preset from the list.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/parental-controls-page-with-restriction-level-dropdown-menu-on-the-ps5.JPG"                      alt="Parental Controls page with restriction level dropdown menu on the PS5"                ></li><li><strong>Optional</strong> : Customize the preset by adjusting the restriction level for all the other options on the page.</li><li>Choose<strong>Confirm</strong> when you’re finished.</li></ol><p>You can set age restrictions for the following options:</p><ul><li>PS5, PS4, and PS3 games and apps.</li><li>Blu-ray discs and DVDs.</li><li>PlayStation VR2 and PlayStation VR.</li><li>Web browsing (even though<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/access-web-browser-on-ps5/" >the PS5’s web browser is hidden and limited <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ).</li><li>Communication and user-generated content.</li><li>Online content.</li></ul><p> You’ll find the options to change the restriction levels for all of the above on that parental control page. You should adjust it based on your parenting preferences and the child’s age.</p><h2 id="3-Set-Up-Console-Restrictions-and-User-Passcodes"><a href="#3-Set-Up-Console-Restrictions-and-User-Passcodes" class="headerlink" title="3. Set Up Console Restrictions and User Passcodes"></a>3. Set Up Console Restrictions and User Passcodes</h2><p> Console restrictions are a group of features on the PS5 that allows you to control how users can create accounts on the PS5. A smart kid can bypass your content restrictions by simply creating a new account on the PS5 to use instead of the child account you created for them. Or they could log into an adult account if you haven’t set a passcode on it.</p><p> Therefore, the first thing you should do is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-ps5-passcode/" >set up user passcodes for your PS5 accounts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After that, you have to set up console restrictions, which use a separate passcode from your user passcode. In case your child gets access to your account, they still won’t be able to tinker with the restrictions you’ve set.</p><p>Here’s how to set up the console restrictions passcode:</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Family and Parental Controls &gt; PS5 Console Restrictions</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/family-and-parental-controls-page-on-the-ps5.JPG"                      alt="Family and Parental Controls page on the PS5"                ></li><li>Enter the default passcode:<strong>0000</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/console-restriction-passcode-on-the-ps5.JPG"                      alt="Console restriction passcode on the PS5"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Change Your Console Restriction Passcode</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ps5-console-restrictions-page.JPG"                      alt="PS5 Console Restrictions page"                ></li><li>Enter the new password twice.</li></ol><p> On the PS5 console restrictions page, apart from changing the console restrictions passcode, you have options to:</p><ul><li>Allow or disallow users from creating new users and logging in as guests (<strong>User Creation and Guest Login</strong>). This is useful for stopping the child from creating new accounts to bypass your restrictions</li><li>Establish default parental controls for new users (<strong>Parental Controls for New Users</strong>). It is useful for setting up age-appropriate content and feature restrictions if you want to let them create new users.</li><li>Disable console restrictions (<strong>Temporarily Disable PS5 Console Restrictions</strong>). You can use this to turn off console restrictions temporarily in case it’s too restrictive for you as an adult user.</li></ul><p> Don’t forget your console restriction passcode. As far as we know, there’s no way to recover it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Set-a-Checkout-Password-and-a-Monthly-Spending-Limit"><a href="#4-Set-a-Checkout-Password-and-a-Monthly-Spending-Limit" class="headerlink" title="4.

Set a Checkout Password and a Monthly Spending Limit</h2><p> There are internet horror stories of kids spending hundreds to thousands of dollars buying applications and video games with their parents’ cards. Avoid that by setting up spending limits and a checkout password.</p><p> Add a checkout password from <strong>Settings &gt; Users and Accounts &gt; Account &gt; Payment and Subscriptions &gt; Purchase Settings</strong> . Turn on the<strong>Require Password at Checkout</strong> toggle, and it’ll prompt you to enter your PSN password before making a purchase.</p><p> The next thing you want to do is place a spending limit. Here’s how to set a monthly spending limit on your child’s account:</p><ol><li>Go to<strong>Settings</strong> and choose<strong>Family and Parental Controls</strong> .</li><li>Choose your child’s account from the<strong>Applicable Users on This PS5</strong> section.</li><li>Select<strong>Parental Controls</strong> and scroll to the bottom to see<strong>Monthly Spending Limit</strong> .</li><li>Open<strong>Monthly Spending Limit</strong> to reveal the dropdown menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ps5-monthly-spending-limit-dropdown-menu-in-parental-controls-page.JPG"                      alt="PS5 Monthly Spending Limit dropdown menu in Parental Controls page"                ></li><li>Select<strong>Confirm</strong> after you’re finished.</li></ol><p> We’re unsure why Sony made the spending limit a dropdown preset menu.

If you want to maintain a stable gameplay experience, here are a few checks and fixes to try.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Perform-Some-Preliminary-Checks"><a href="#1-Perform-Some-Preliminary-Checks" class="headerlink" title="1. Perform Some Preliminary Checks"></a>1. Perform Some Preliminary Checks</h2><p> Perform the following preliminary checks before moving on to major fixes:</p><ul><li>Restart Rust after closing the error window.</li><li>Restart Steam to resolve potential problems with the gaming client.</li><li>Whitelist Rust from Windows Defender to ensure that your security does not interfere with the game’s connection. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/" >how to allow apps through Windows Defender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Opt out of the Steam beta programs you’re currently subscribed to. To do this, navigate to<strong>Steam &gt; Settings</strong> , go to the<strong>Account</strong> tab, then click the<strong>Change</strong> button. After that, click<strong>None - Opt. out of all beta programs</strong> .</li></ul><p> If none of the above checks resolve the problem, apply the remaining fixes.</p><h2 id="2-Ensure-the-Rust-and-Steam-Servers-Aren’t-Down"><a href="#2-Ensure-the-Rust-and-Steam-Servers-Aren’t-Down" class="headerlink" title="2. Ensure the Rust and Steam Servers Aren’t Down"></a>2. Ensure the Rust and Steam Servers Aren’t Down</h2><p> The “Steam Auth Timeout” error occurs when the connection between the Steam client and Rust servers encounters an issue. Therefore, it’s a good idea to double-check that both servers are operating normally before you start tweaking stuff on your computer.</p><p> Go to the<a class="link"   href="https://downoutages.com/" >Down Outages website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , search for**”Rust”** and**”Steam”** in the top right corner, and hit<strong>Enter</strong> . If there are numerous outages reported, there is probably a backend problem. In that case, you should only wait for the developers to resolve the issue. If you don’t see any reports suggesting this error is unique to you, it’s time to start tweaking settings on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-5.jpg"                      alt="Check the Status of Steam on the Down Outages Official Website"                ></p><p> Steam and Rust mostly announce maintenance downtimes on their Twitter accounts. So, take a peek at the<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Steam" >Steam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/playrust" >Rust Twitter accounts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for more information.</p><h2 id="3-Is-Your-Device-Connected-to-the-Internet"><a href="#3-Is-Your-Device-Connected-to-the-Internet" class="headerlink" title="3. Is Your Device Connected to the Internet?"></a>3. Is Your Device Connected to the Internet?</h2><p> The Steam client’s connection to the Rust servers can also go down if your device loses connection to the internet. If you’ve been kicked out of Rust in the middle of play, an internet connection disruption could be to blame. Therefore, before moving forward, it is imperative to check that.</p><p> Press the<strong>Windows key</strong> to minimize the game window, and then check if the internet connection is active. If the internet connection seems to be working, be sure to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/" >check the stability of your internet connection on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118304/7443" target="_top" id="2118304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118304/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Analyze-the-Stability-of-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#4-Analyze-the-Stability-of-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="4.

Your connection to the router must strong enough to maintain a stable connection with the client and Rust servers. If the connection weakens during gameplay, the connection can falter, triggering the “Steam Auth Timeout” error.</p><p> If this is your first time checking the stability of your internet connection, refer to our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-wifi-network-strength/" >how to check the strength of your internet connection on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for some helpful tips.

Check for Download Cache Corruption"></a>5. Check for Download Cache Corruption</h2><p> Coruption in Steam’s download cache can also prevent games from updating and cause connection-related errors. If Rust throws the “Steam Auth Timeout” error when you launch it, the download cache is most likely causing the issue. Therefore, you should clear the download cache by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Launch Steam.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Steam</strong> menu and select<strong>Settings</strong> .</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Downloads</strong> tab in the left sidebar.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Clear Download Cache</strong> button. Then, click<strong>OK</strong> to confirm your action.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/click-on-clear-download-cache-button-to-clear-outdated-cache.jpg"                      alt="Click on Clear Download Cache Button to Clear Outdated Cache"                ></li></ol><p> Restart Steam again, and the error under discussion should now disappear.

Check the Rust Game Files for Corruption"></a>6. Check the Rust Game Files for Corruption</h2><p> The corruption of game files can also interfere with the connection between Rust servers and your gaming client. You can rule out corruption issues by verifying the integrity of game files using Steam’s built-in feature. So, repair the game files to ensure they aren’t causing the problem. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Right-click the Rust game icon and select<strong>Properties</strong> .</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Local Files</strong> tab on the left.</li><li>Click the<strong>Verify integrity of game files</strong> button to repair the game files.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/verify-integrity-of-game-files-in-steam.jpg"                      alt="Verify Integrity of Game Files in Steam"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134495/18498" target="_top" id="2134495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134495/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Disable-the-Cheat-Software-and-Repair-the-Easy-Anti-Cheat-Program"><a href="#7-Disable-the-Cheat-Software-and-Repair-the-Easy-Anti-Cheat-Program" class="headerlink" title="7. Disable the Cheat Software and Repair the Easy Anti-Cheat Program"></a>7. Disable the Cheat Software and Repair the Easy Anti-Cheat Program</h2><p> Using cheat software can also cause Rust to crash and present the “Steam Auth Timeout” error. Therefore, if you currently use such software to gain an advantage in the game, you should turn it off or uninstall it. Also, you should turn off any other cheat software running on your device, even those unrelated to Rust.</p><p> Repairing the Easy Anti-Cheat software has also fixed the issue for some users who have encountered the error. Given the possibility that this step could resolve the issue, follow the below steps to repair the application:</p><ol><li>Go to the installation folder of the game.</li><li>Locate the EasyAntiCheat folder.</li><li>Open the folder and double-click<strong>EasyAntiCheat.exe</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Rust</strong> from the dropdown menu if it isn’t already selected.</li><li>Click<strong>Repair Service</strong> and let the software be fully repaired.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/easy-anticheat-software.jpg"                      alt="Repairing the Easy Anti-Cheat Service on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> If that doesn’t work, you can uninstall Rust and reinstall it from the ground up.</p><h2 id="8-Uninstall-Rust-and-Reinstall-It"><a href="#8-Uninstall-Rust-and-Reinstall-It" class="headerlink" title="8. Uninstall Rust and Reinstall It"></a>8. Uninstall Rust and Reinstall It</h2><p> If none of the above fixes work, the problem could be with the game’s installation itself. To make sure this isn’t the case, you should uninstall Rust and reinstall it from scratch. If you’re not familiar with the process, check out our guide on<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-uninstall-steam-games-reinstall/" >how to uninstall Steam games and reinstall them fresh <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Don’t worry; you won’t have to pay for the game again if you uninstall it.

Hopefully, you now better understand what causes this error and what fixes you can apply. If the problem persists, reinstall the game and Steam client from scratch.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mov-in-the-cloud-top-six-techniques-for-windows-11-users/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved .MOV in the Cloud - Top Six Techniques for Windows 11 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-deep-dive-into-competitive-ar-stickers-outside-google/"><u>2024 Approved A Deep Dive Into Competitive AR Stickers Outside Google</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/clipboxwindows-windows/"><u>ClipboxアプリケーションのWindowsバージョンを探す - Windows非互換時の解決策</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/comprehensive-tips-to-resolve-missing-xinput1ndll-files/"><u>Comprehensive Tips to Resolve Missing Xinput1_n.dll Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/decoding-the-secrets-of-nvidia-g-sync-in-gaming/"><u>Decoding the Secrets of Nvidia G-Sync in Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/find-the-ultimate-elgato-stream-deck-model/"><u>Find the Ultimate Elgato Stream Deck Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/1722900762008-investigating-aol-mail-problems-how-to-tell-if-its-a-general-downtvein-or-personal-internet-concern/"><u>Investigating AOL Mail Problems: How to Tell If It's a General Downtvein or Personal Internet Concern</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/making-friends-across-platforms-bedrock-java-via-geysermc-server/"><u>Making Friends Across Platforms: Bedrock-Java via GeyserMC Server</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/overcoming-launch-issues-with-diablo-ii-resurrected-a-comprehhrenous-guide/"><u>Overcoming Launch Issues with Diablo II: Resurrected – A Comprehhrenous Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/past-price-points-of-games-on-steam/"><u>Past Price Points of Games on Steam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/performance-testing-of-seatechs-external-blu-ray-with-usb-writers-does-quality-meet-expectations-in-our-detailed-review/"><u>Performance Testing of SeaTech's External Blu-Ray with USB Writers: Does Quality Meet Expectations in Our Detailed Review?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/regain-social-media-ground-bypassing-lost-phones-on-fb/"><u>Regain Social Media Ground: Bypassing Lost Phones on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/screen-and-sanctuary-packing-essentials-for-travel-gamers/"><u>Screen & Sanctuary: Packing Essentials for Travel Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/step-by-step-launching-games-via-emudeck-on-steam-deck/"><u>Step-by-Step: Launching Games via EmuDeck on Steam Deck</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/the-16-best-couch-co-op-games-for-xbox-series-xs/"><u>The 16 Best Couch Co-Op Games for Xbox Series X/S</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Tech-Lightened-Up-Tecno-Reveals-Reduced-Size-Gadgets"><a href="#Tech-Lightened-Up-Tecno-Reveals-Reduced-Size-Gadgets" class="headerlink" title="Tech Lightened Up: Tecno Reveals Reduced-Size Gadgets"></a>Tech Lightened Up: Tecno Reveals Reduced-Size Gadgets</h2><p> Looking to grab an increased share of the laptop market, Tecno is seeking to make a splash with its reveal of two new laptops the Tecno Megabook T1 2023 14-inch and the Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition. While we’ve seen more surprising and eye-catching releases from Tecno, including their recent Phantom V Fold, this year’s event in Berlin focuses on refreshing their popular laptop lineup with increased portability and personality.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Tecno is unveiling two new laptops, the Tecno Megabook T1 2023 14-inch and the Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition, with an emphasis on portability and personality.</li><li>The Tecno Megabook T1 14” offers a smaller form factor but manages to surprise with even more impressive battery life, with a larger battery and claims of up to 18.5 hours of runtime.</li><li>The Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition uses polychromatic photoisomer technology, revealing a pixel font pattern when exposed to UV light. Pricing and customization options have not been announced.</li></ul><h2 id="Tecno-Megabook-T1-14”-Smaller-Yet-Longer-Battery-Life"><a href="#Tecno-Megabook-T1-14”-Smaller-Yet-Longer-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Tecno Megabook T1 14”: Smaller, Yet Longer Battery Life"></a>Tecno Megabook T1 14”: Smaller, Yet Longer Battery Life</h2><p> Building off the success of their popular Megabook T1, Tecno wanted to make an even more portable version that still retained its excellent selection of I&#x2F;O and features. You’d think downsizing from a 15.6” chassis to a smaller 14” would also result in sacrificed battery capacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-t1.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook T1"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> While its thickness of 14.8mm remains unchanged from last year’s Megabook 15.6”, the new T1 14” is lighter at 1.39kg (vs 1.48kg) and manages to fit a larger 75Wh (vs 70Wh) battery which claims to provide 1 hour of extra runtime at up to 18.5 hours. For fast charging, you’ll find the same 65W GaN power adapter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-t1-2.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook T1-2"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Although the smaller 14” display may not seem as appealing if you prefer having extra screen real estate, the T1 14” has upgraded to a 16:10 aspect ratio with a screen-to-body ratio of 90%, and still provides 100%sRGB color and TUV eye protection. Rounding off this new model, it retains the Red Dot Design Award from last year with its “premium aluminum metallic body,” offering a great balance of portability, performance, and the largest battery in its price range.</p><h2 id="Tecno-Megabook-S1-Dazzling-Edition"><a href="#Tecno-Megabook-S1-Dazzling-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition"></a>Tecno Megabook S1 Dazzling Edition</h2><p> Rather than a complete redesign, TECNO showcased a concept special, “Dazzling” edition S1. While its chassis and internals remain unchanged, the S1 Dazzling’s top lid and wrist pad area get a subtle tech&#x2F;magic makeover.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-display.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Display"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> Using polychromatic photoisomer, in its White Moon color, the monochrome surface of the S1 can reveal colors when exposed to UV light. To demo this for us, they shined a UV flashlight over the surface for a few seconds to reveal “MEGABOOK S1” written in pixel font along the right side of the top lid. First seen on the Camon 19 Pro Mondrian Edition smartphone which launched last year, Tecno is expanding this technology to their other devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-keyboard-deck.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Keyboard Deck"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><p> While the effect wasn’t as pronounced inside during their booth presentation, I imagine longer exposure to the sun would really highlight this change in appearance. Additionally, while this remains a concept product and pricing hasn’t been announced, we suspect that Techno is looking to bring its unique technology in at a similar affordable starting price point as the standard Megabook S1. It’s unclear what customization users will have over the displayed text or designs, though just as with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 with its AniMe Matrix Display on its lid, the S1 Dazzling Edition will likely find its fan base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tecno-megabook-s1-top-lid.jpg"                      alt="TECNO MegaBook S1 - Top Lid"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Paul Antil&#x2F;MakeUseOf</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135402/19272" target="_top" id="2135402">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135402" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135402/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tecno’s-New-Laptops-Dazzle-at-IFA-2023"><a href="#Tecno’s-New-Laptops-Dazzle-at-IFA-2023" class="headerlink" title="Tecno’s New Laptops Dazzle at IFA 2023"></a>Tecno’s New Laptops Dazzle at IFA 2023</h2><p> IFA 2023 often reveals the best new laptops you’ll see throughout the next year, and this year’s edition was no different.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Digital-Duelist-Decisions-Controllers-Vs-Arcade-Sticks"><a href="#Digital-Duelist-Decisions-Controllers-Vs-Arcade-Sticks" class="headerlink" title="Digital Duelist Decisions: Controllers Vs. Arcade Sticks"></a>Digital Duelist Decisions: Controllers Vs. Arcade Sticks</h2><p> The fighting game community is one of the oldest competitive video game scenes. It began with meetups in local arcades and has since become much more accessible to players.</p><p> While the platform has changed, the drive for competition remains the same, and players are always looking for an edge. So, which of the two most common inputs in the Fighting Game Community (FGC) is better: controller or arcade stick?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Factors-to-Consider"><a href="#Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Factors-to-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Factors to Consider"></a>Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Factors to Consider</h2><p> Most fighting games were first ported to consoles before becoming available on PCs. The controllers that come with these consoles have changed significantly over the years, but the original design concept remains the same.</p><p> Controllers try to capture the magic of the arcade in a smaller form factor. Some of the best controllers currently on the market, like the Xbox Series X|S controller and the PS5’s DualSense controller, go above and beyond.</p><p> While these serve their intended purpose, portable arcade sticks are now readily available to fighting game enthusiasts. Both options have their merits, and here are a few factors to consider when deciding which is best for fighting games.</p><h3 id="1-Input-Precision"><a href="#1-Input-Precision" class="headerlink" title="1. Input Precision"></a>1. Input Precision</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/darts-g42b26ee2a_1920.jpg"                      alt="Darts on a dartboard"                ></p><p> It’s time to take a closer look at what is required to be competitive in a fighting game. There’s a reason the FGC is thriving after over 30 years of competition.</p><p> Every input matters when facing the best, creating a large skill ceiling for new players to explore. The sky is the limit, provided that your precision and speed of execution are on point. With this in mind, your controller of choice needs to support input precision.</p><p> First, let’s consider the controller. Controllers have varying buttons that can be assigned to different actions in-game. However, movement is usually restricted to two options. You could either use a joystick or a D-Pad. As freeing as both options can be, they do have their problems.</p><p> The joystick is pretty small and can be imprecise when used by a novice.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-joystick-drift/" >Joysticks are also prone to stick drift <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after prolonged use, which could cause your character to move unprompted. On the other hand, the D-Pad is a bit more precise but harder to use with a limited range of motion.</p><p> An arcade stick trumps a controller in terms of input precision. The stick is fairly large and combines the freedom of movement a joystick offers with the precision of a D-Pad. Most arcade sticks come with eight input buttons, which is typically sufficient for most games. However, players are forced to use button combinations for other in-game actions.</p><p> So, while an arcade stick is precise, it requires more skill than a controller.</p><h3 id="2-Durability"><a href="#2-Durability" class="headerlink" title="2. Durability"></a>2. Durability</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/broken-controller.jpg"                      alt="Broken controller"                ></p><p> Image Credit: soepratman&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/game-crash-icon-logo-design%5F44691241.htm" >Freepik <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Fighting games are input intense and push whatever controller is used to its limit. As such, it is important to consider the durability of your input of choice before purchasing one. So, let’s look at the build quality of most controllers.</p><p> There are two sides to this argument. Some users praise newer controllers for their ingenuity and solid build, while others feel they aren’t as good as they used to be.</p><p> The fact is, controllers degrade a lot quicker than before. However, this can also be attributed to the rise in competitive gaming. While we aren’t privy to the manufacturing processes of most mainstream controllers, we can see the process behind creating an arcade stick.</p><p> A few YouTube channels cover arcade stick customization, which displays how solid the build quality is. Ultimately, arcade sticks are specifically designed to take a lot of abuse and last a long time.</p><p> A high-quality arcade stick can last five to six years without maintenance and even longer when maintained periodically. Controllers, however, need to be changed more frequently and are costly to fix when damaged.</p><h3 id="3-Functional-Buttons"><a href="#3-Functional-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="3. Functional Buttons"></a>3. Functional Buttons</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/arcade-stick.jpg"                      alt="A yellow arcade stick with blue input buttons"                ></p><p> Input specifications are as unique as each fighting game. As such, it is important to research what your game of choice requires to get the best user experience.</p><p> Controllers typically have a lot more functional buttons than arcade sticks. They come with face and shoulder buttons which most modern fighting games incorporate into their control schemes.</p><p> However,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/why-gamers-swear-arcade-sticks/" >a reason some gamers swear by arcade sticks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is their customizability. You can take your arcade stick apart, change the layout and add whatever buttons you feel are necessary to compete in your game of choice.</p><p> One downside of this approach is the technical knowledge required to customize an arcade stick. Ultimately, a controller might be the better choice depending on how many functional buttons a fighting game requires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115935/19272" target="_top" id="2115935">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115935" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115935/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Feedback"><a href="#4-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most modern fighting game titles allow for varying degrees of feedback. It can be as small as a little vibration when your player gets hit.</p><p> However, not every professional player likes the distraction some of these vibrations could cause, so it isn’t often a factor to consider when choosing between arcade sticks and controllers. Regardless, it still boils down to choice.</p><p> A controller is the best option if you are the type of player that likes feedback when playing your fighting games. Arcade sticks do not come with vibrational feedback in any form.</p><p> However, some enthusiasts are playing around with the idea of introducing haptic feedback to arcade sticks. It is also worth noting that the DualSense controller, in particular, supports haptic feedback, which can<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/force-haptic-feedback-games/" >make your fighting games a bit more immersive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h3 id="5-Ergonomics"><a href="#5-Ergonomics" class="headerlink" title="5. Ergonomics"></a>5. Ergonomics</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ergonomics.jpg"                      alt="A father and his son playing video games on a couch"                ></p><p> Ergonomics as a concept has become increasingly important with the emergence of the competitive gaming scene. Assessing the best ways to optimize your environment for prolonged sitting is important, especially when you spend long hours playing your fighting game of choice.</p><p> Your controller of choice can contribute to the ergonomics of your setup, as surprising as that may sound. Here’s what I mean.</p><p> A controller allows for a more relaxed posture, as gamers can move their controllers as they please. Modern controllers are also designed to fit in many grip styles for prolonged periods. Also, a controller allows you to be further away from the screen and sit on as comfortable of a chair as you own.</p><p> An arcade stick, on the other hand, is large and clunky. One could rest the box on their lap or place it on a table. The first option promotes hunching over during gaming sessions and can be bad for your back.</p><p> You can limit the damage by placing your arcade stick on an adjustable table. An adjustable table allows you to experiment with different heights until you find the one that allows you to sit straight while using your arcade stick.</p><p> However, this is a lot of trouble just to game comfortably. Consequently, there’s no denying that a controller is better ergonomically than an arcade stick.</p><h3 id="6-Compatibility"><a href="#6-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="6. Compatibility"></a>6. Compatibility</h3><p> This is the ultimate factor when choosing between a controller and an arcade stick. Now, most fighting games are available both on console and PC. However, does your device support a controller or a fighting stick? Or does it support both? Also, how easily can you hook up your controller or fight stick to your device?</p><p> Well, both consoles and PCs support controllers to varying degrees. Controllers work well with their matching console and also on PC. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S controllers are plug-and-play compatible with Windows.</p><p> Most fighting games operate on Steam, which has facilities that support traditional controllers and arcade sticks. So, you shouldn’t have a problem with either option if you run your game on Steam.</p><p> On the other hand, consoles are very picky about the arcade sticks permitted to run on the platform. As such, you’ll need to research and discover what arcade sticks your console supports.</p><p> Long story short, compatibility is a limiting factor affecting console players more than their PC Counterparts. Both inputs work seamlessly on PC, while only a small selection of both work on consoles.</p><h2 id="Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Which-Is-the-Better-Option"><a href="#Controller-vs-Arcade-Stick-Which-Is-the-Better-Option" class="headerlink" title="Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Which Is the Better Option?"></a>Controller vs. Arcade Stick: Which Is the Better Option?</h2><p> After going over a few criteria integral to deciding what input you should choose, let’s come to a vrerdict. Well, if you intend to reach the peak of competitive fighting games, you will need an arcade stick. The precision and functionality are incomparable.</p><p> However, some top players in the fighting game scene use controllers. Albeit possible, it takes much more effort to be good on a controller consistently. If you have the extra time to put in, then it won’t be a problem. Otherwise, an arcade stick is the way to go.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Get-the-Best-Competitive-Advantage"><a href="#Get-the-Best-Competitive-Advantage" class="headerlink" title="Get the Best Competitive Advantage"></a>Get the Best Competitive Advantage</h2><p> The ultimate goal of any competitive fighting game player is to be the best.

These computers typically start at $2,000 with no upper limit. So, if that’s what you’re after, let’s compare the top processors from Intel and AMD.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>Cores (Threads)</th><th>Base Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>Turbo Clock Speed (GHz)</th><th>L3 Cache (MB)</th><th>Max TDP (W)</th><th>Price</th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td>P-Cores</td><td>E-Cores</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intel Core i9-14900K</strong></td><td>8 (16)</td><td>8 (16)</td><td>3.2</td><td>2.4</td><td>5.8</td><td>4.4</td><td>36</td><td>253</td><td>$589</td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</strong></td><td>16 (32)</td><td>4.2</td><td>5.7</td><td>32+96</td><td>120</td><td>$699</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</strong></td><td>12 (24)</td><td>4.4</td><td>5.6</td><td>32+96</td><td>120</td><td>$599</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p> When you look at the numbers on paper, the 14900K matches the 7950X3D based on core count. Both AMD chips have a higher base clock speed than Intel’s offering, but Intel beats them with its turbo clock speed. Despite this, the X3D’s massive L3 cache is known to give AMD an advantage in gaming.</p><p> Still, these numbers don’t mean anything in the real world. Unfortunately, we cannot find benchmark results that featured all three processors together, so let’s first see how the 7950X3D compares against the 14900K from<a class="link"   href="http://youtu.be/2MvvCr-thM8" >Gamer Nexus’ test <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>Intel Core i9-14900K</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rainbow Six Siege (1440p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>511.2</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td><strong>F1 23 (1440p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>392.8</td><td>400.1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 (1440p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>107.6</td><td>121.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Fantasy XIV (1440p &#x2F; Maximum)</strong></td><td>269</td><td>212.6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Starfield (1080p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>123</td><td>102.5</td></tr></tbody></table><p> As you can see, there are mixed results between the 14900K and the 7950X3D. While the latter usually performs better, the 14900K gains a massive advantage on a couple of titles.</p><p> Now, let’s see how the 7900X3D performs against its more powerful sibling. Again, we’re using Gamer Nexus’ results, which used the same PC configuration as the previous test.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rainbow Six Siege (1080p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>840.9</td><td>808.6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Final Fantasy XIV (1080p &#x2F; Maximum)</strong></td><td>255.9</td><td>250.5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shadow of the Tomb Raider (1080p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>382.6</td><td>334.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CSGO (1440p &#x2F; Very High)</strong></td><td>383.9</td><td>386.9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 (1080p &#x2F; Medium)</strong></td><td>267.6</td><td>255.7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Far Cry 6 (1080p &#x2F; High)</strong></td><td>198.2</td><td>194.7</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Given that the 7950X3D is the faster, more expensive model, it just makes sense that it will perform better than the 7900X3D. But how will the 7900X3D perform against the 14900K? This time, let’s look at the<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlDJfEWohpQ" >results of Mark PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><table><thead><tr><th>Average FPS</th><th>Intel Core i9-14900K</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>God of War (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>113</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cyberpunk 2077 (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>83</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>123</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Watch Dogs Legion (4K &#x2F; Ultra)</strong></td><td>114</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Red Dead Redemption II (4K &#x2F; Favor Quality)</strong></td><td>133</td><td>119</td></tr></tbody></table><p> According to the test results, the 7950X3D is the best performer, but by a small margin over the 14900K. On the other hand, the 14900K easily overcomes the 7900X3D.</p><p> This means AMD is the better option for high-end gaming because of its raw horsepower. However, if you consider the prices of these chips, you might want to choose Intel’s processor instead because it’s the cheapest of the bunch.

Based on the results, there’s no clear winner between both CPU makers. While AMD and Intel are neck-and-neck at the top end of the market, the former demolishes the latter in mid-range gaming—so much so that some high-end gaming PCs use the 7800X3D instead. But when it comes to budget processors, Intel remains king.</p><p> If you’re on a no-holds-barred mission to build the most powerful gaming PC, then yes, AMD is the best gaming CPU. But if you’re looking for a balance between price and power, the line becomes a bit more blurred as you must consider other aspects like your existing system and the compatibility of more affordable parts like DDR4 RAM.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2023-how-to-fix-live-video-interrupted-on-facebook-in-2024/"><u>[New] 2023 | How to Fix Live Video Interrupted on Facebook, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-mobile-screen-snatching-androids-leading-eight/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Free Mobile Screen Snatching - Android's Leading Eight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-guide-deleting-items-from-your-youtubeumbers-list-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Guide Deleting Items From Your YouTube'umbers List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-applications-share-videos-on-twitter/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Applications Share Videos on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-uncharted-territory-in-facebooks-meme-landscape-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Uncharted Territory in Facebook's Meme Landscape for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/decoding-the-best-elgato-stream-deck-features/"><u>Decoding the Best Elgato Stream Deck Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/explore-the-heart-of-palworld/"><u>Explore the Heart of PalWorld</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/here-are-some-of-the-best-pokemon-discord-servers-to-join-on-honor-90-lite-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Here are Some of the Best Pokemon Discord Servers to Join On Honor 90 Lite | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/high-end-games-and-the-debate-on-mt-integration/"><u>High-End Games and the Debate on MT Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/how-to-disable-and-restrict-xbox-game-bar-background-activity-in-windows-10-and-11/"><u>How to Disable and Restrict Xbox Game Bar Background Activity in Windows 10 and 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-device-icloud-dns-bypass-explained-and-tested-plus-easy-alternatives-on-apple-iphone-13-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Device iCloud DNS Bypass Explained and Tested, Plus Easy Alternatives On Apple iPhone 13</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/playing-fortnite-on-iphone-using-geforce-cloud-gaming/"><u>Playing Fortnite on iPhone Using GeForce Cloud Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/revive-lost-memories-secure-and-reliable-ways-to-restore-deleted-iphone-pictures/"><u>Revive Lost Memories: Secure and Reliable Ways to Restore Deleted iPhone Pictures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/taking-back-your-xbox-wireless-update/"><u>Taking Back Your Xbox Wireless Update</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unveiling-twitch-engaging-with-video-content-online/"><u>Unveiling Twitch: Engaging with Video Content Online</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

None of these settings are activated by default, so if you don’t know about them, you are likely not using your Switch to its full potential.</p><p> If you want to learn how to extend your Switch’s battery life, get faster download speeds, and get better graphics while playing docked, you can find all of that and more below.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves"><a href="#1-Enable-Cloud-Data-Saves" class="headerlink" title="1. Enable Cloud Data Saves"></a>1. Enable Cloud Data Saves</h2><p> Have you ever spent hours on a game and lost all of your progress? This issue is more common than you would think. Whether your Switch gets stolen, you break your console accidentally, or maybe you lend your sibling your Switch, and they accidentally save over your save file. These things are unfortunate, but they can happen, and that can result in hours of progress down the drain.</p><p> If you’ve ever experienced this, you will understand the seven stages of grief that follow, usually culminating in you deciding to ditch the game for good rather than spend countless hours building back up to the point you were at before. All of this can be avoided, however, if you activate Cloud saves on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/save-data-cloud-settings-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Save Data Cloud Settings on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To do so, head to the settings and make your way to<strong>Data Management</strong> . From there, click<strong>Save Data Cloud</strong> and choose your<strong>user profile</strong> . Scroll down to<strong>Settings</strong> at the bottom and turn on<strong>Automatically Back Up Save Data</strong> . Once you have activated this setting, you will be able to retrieve any data you lose. This feature is only available if you have a Nintendo Switch Online Membership.</p><h2 id="2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life"><a href="#2-Use-Flight-Mode-to-Extend-Your-Switch’s-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life"></a>2. Use Flight Mode to Extend Your Switch’s Battery Life</h2><p> Putting your Nintendo Switch in Flight Mode limits your ability to connect to the internet. But if the game you’re currently playing doesn’t use internet, you can save a decent amount of battery life by putting your Switch in Flight Mode even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</p><p> Being connected to the internet and having your console constantly send and receive that signal uses energy. Putting your console in Flight Mode saves valuable resources that, if you’re not using them anyway, are better used elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/flight-mode-menu-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Flight Mode Menu on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> To put your phone on Flight Mode. Simply open your settings and scroll down to<strong>Flight Mode</strong> . It’s the second option on the menu and will only take a moment to activate, but could save you precious moments in your game.</p><h2 id="3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#3-Use-Quick-Archive-to-Free-Up-Space-on-Your-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch"></a>3. Use Quick Archive to Free Up Space on Your Nintendo Switch</h2><p> The Switch doesn’t have a lot of storage space. A Switch Lite, for example, only has 32GB of space available, and a portion of that is reserved for the system. 32GB may sound like a lot, but if you’re looking at downloading big games, even the Switch OLED’s improved 64 GB will quickly disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/quick-archive-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Quick Archive on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> Your options here are to buy a large SD card to give your Switch more storage space or juggle your games. If your Switch is full, but you want to download a new game, don’t worry. You don’t have to delete all of your games to make space, you can quickly archive them instead.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/nintendo-switch-how-to-archive-software/" >Archiving software on your Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> still frees up storage space, but leaves an icon of the game on your home screen, so you can quickly and easily redownload it when you’re ready.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio"><a href="#4-Enable-Bluetooth-Audio" class="headerlink" title="4.

So Switch owners are now able to enjoy all the wonderful sounds of the Switch without the pesky wires.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/activate-bluetooth-audio-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="Activate Bluetooth Audio on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123749/7443" target="_top" id="2123749">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123749" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123749/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Not everyone keeps up to date with the ins and outs of every Nintendo Switch update that comes out. So, if you, like many others, were still unaware of the fact that you could connect Bluetooth headphones to your Switch, this may come as a welcome surprise to you.

Tweak Your TV Resolution Settings to Get Better Graphics</h2><p> One of the most underrated Nintendo Switch settings can actually improve the graphics of your system when you’re playing in docked mode. But like many other settings on this list, it is buried in menus and not easy to find unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. Thankfully, you have us to show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tv-resolution-on-nintendo-switch.jpg"                      alt="TV Resolution on Nintendo Switch"                ></p><p> If your TV is capable of displaying a 1080p image, so is your Nintendo Switch. In handheld mode, the Switch is only capable of 720p, but this can be improved in docked mode.

This is a phenomenon caused by a wearing down of the mechanisms inside the joystick that leads to false input in your controller and makes your character or camera start moving on its own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-calibrate-controller-on-nintendo-switch-calibrate-control-sticks.jpg"                      alt="How to calibrate controller on Nintendo Switch Calibrate Control Sticks"                ></p><p> This issue can cause some serious headaches in-game, but there is a way to fix it (if the case is mild enough.) That is by recalibrating your Joy-Cons or any other controller you may be having issues with. Simply head to your settings, select<strong>Controllers and Sensors</strong> , and press<strong>Calibrate Control Sticks</strong> . The Switch will guide you through the rest of the process, and you should finally experience some relief from drift for a little while, at least.</p><h2 id="7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds"><a href="#7-Alter-the-MTU-Setting-to-Unlock-Faster-Download-Speeds" class="headerlink" title="7.

It also comes in two keycap themes: Blue Santorini and Pink Tokyo.</p><p> Akko sent us the MOD007B PC Tokyo for this review, which features pink and white keys with printed English and Japanese characters. The spacebar also features Mount Fuji with a torii and some cherry blossoms in the foreground to complete the theme.</p><p> All of these sit on a plain white plastic case with two-level adjustable feet. You also get a plain white knob for adjusting volume and RGB brightness. This keyboard would look great on any desk. Even if you aim for a minimalist gaming station, its design could be your PC’s focal point.</p><h2 id="Tokyo-Themed-Keys-and-Accessories-Included"><a href="#Tokyo-Themed-Keys-and-Accessories-Included" class="headerlink" title="Tokyo-Themed Keys and Accessories Included"></a>Tokyo-Themed Keys and Accessories Included</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-tokyo-themed-accessories.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Tokyo-themed Accessories"                ></p><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Beyond the keyboard, you also get several accessories matching the theme. You’ll find a coiled white USB-C cable with a thick matte rubber coating, a lavender keycap puller, a lavender switch remover, and 19 extra Tokyo-themed keycaps.</p><p> The extra keycaps contain Japanese icons, but installing them could potentially mix up the perfect pink-and-white combination on the stock keys already. But they’re still a great option if you want to customize your keyboard further and have memorized the placement of non-alphanumeric keys.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-keycap-accessories.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Keycap Accessories"                ></p><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115915/19272" target="_top" id="2115915">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115915" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115915/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Akko-MOD007B-Means-Serious-Business-Underneath"><a href="#The-Akko-MOD007B-Means-Serious-Business-Underneath" class="headerlink" title="The Akko MOD007B Means Serious Business Underneath"></a>The Akko MOD007B Means Serious Business Underneath</h2><p> What makes the Akko MOD007B different from most gaming keyboards is that it uses Hall Effect switches instead of mechanical keys.<a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mechanical-keyboard-work-technology-explained/" >Mechanical keyboards work by using springs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to control how much pressure you need to apply before it closes the switch.</p><p> On the other hand, Hall Effect switches have no moving parts. Instead, it uses the changing position of two magnets to determine a key’s position. Because of this, Hall Effect keyboards have a longer lifespan than traditional mechanical switches, just like<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-hall-effect-joysticks-can-they-cure-controller-drift/" >Hall Effect joysticks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-hall-effect-switch.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Hall-Effect Switch"                ></p><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> However, the most significant advantage of Hall Effect keyboards is that you can customize their actuation pressure. Unlike mechanical keyboards, where you have to replace the switches or brands to change how much pressure you need to apply before a key activates, you can set this to your desired distance on Hall Effect switches.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/keychron-q5-keyboard-different-switches.jpg" >keychron q5 keyboard different switches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](&#x2F;hall-effect-vs-optical-switches&#x2F;)</p><p>Related</p><h5 id="Hall-Effect-vs-Optical-What-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches-Should-You-Choose"><a href="#Hall-Effect-vs-Optical-What-Mechanical-Keyboard-Switches-Should-You-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Hall Effect vs. Optical: What Mechanical Keyboard Switches Should You Choose?"></a>Hall Effect vs. Optical: What Mechanical Keyboard Switches Should You Choose?</h5><p> Mechanical switches come in all shapes and sizes, but some are much better than others.</p><p> On the Akko MOD007B, you can pick between 0.2 and 3.8mm actuation distance, making your keyboard as light or heavy as you need. Furthermore, since you can accurately determine a Hall Effect key’s movement, you could assign multiple actions to a single keystroke. This means you can set various actions to each key that will only activate depending on its position.</p><p> The MOD007B is also compatible with three-pin mechanical switches. So, if you prefer using mechanical keys (or if you’re playing in a competition that requires mechanical switches), you can easily switch them out on your keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-three-pin-mechanical-switch-compatible-pcb.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Three-Pin Mechanical Switch-Compatible PCB"                ></p><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><h2 id="Typing-on-Cloud-Nine"><a href="#Typing-on-Cloud-Nine" class="headerlink" title="Typing on Cloud Nine"></a>Typing on Cloud Nine</h2><p> Aside from the advantages of Hall Effect keys, the Akko MOD007B also delivers an excellent typing feel. The keyboard itself uses a gasket mount for a soft and relaxed typing experience. And when you press on the keys hard, you’ll notice them sink into the case, especially for keys near the edges.</p><p> Even when you bottom out the keys, you’ll feel as if it’s cushioned, reducing the stress on your fingertips. And although it doesn’t have the bassy, thocky sound some keyboard enthusiasts look for, it still delivers excellent audible feedback for each keypress you make.</p><h2 id="Extensive-Customization-With-the-Akko-Cloud-Driver"><a href="#Extensive-Customization-With-the-Akko-Cloud-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Extensive Customization With the Akko Cloud Driver"></a>Extensive Customization With the Akko Cloud Driver</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-cloud-driver-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Cloud Driver Screenshot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134493/18498" target="_top" id="2134493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134493/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Of course, hardware is no good if you don’t pair it with great software. Thankfully, the Akko MOD007B comes with an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand driver. On thge Main tab you can remap your keyboard, change its Dynamic Keystroke settings, and set custom actuation distances for the entire keyboard or each key.</p><p> You can also create up to two function layers to map more than 100 keys and shortcuts in just two presses. Finally, there’s the Macro menu for recording macros and the Light menu to change the keyboard’s RGB lighting as you see fit.</p><p> But best of all, any changes you make to the keyboard are stored on it. So, even if you switch PCs or upgrade to a newer device, you don’t have to download the driver and recreate your saved keyboard settings.</p><h2 id="Confusing-Multi-Mode-Pairing"><a href="#Confusing-Multi-Mode-Pairing" class="headerlink" title="Confusing Multi-Mode Pairing"></a>Confusing Multi-Mode Pairing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-mode-switch-slider-under-the-caps-lock-key.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE mode switch slider under the caps lock key"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> However, the Akko MOD007B isn’t all rainbows and sunshine. The Hall Effect keyboard has a few drawbacks—particularly when using it wirelessly.</p><p> My biggest concern is the confusing Bluetooth and 2.4GHz pairing modes. Instead of the usual Fn+Q&#x2F;W&#x2F;E&#x2F;R key combinations for pairing the keyboard wirelessly, it uses Fn+E&#x2F;R&#x2F;T&#x2F;Y&#x2F;U. And you wouldn’t even know what mode you’re using unless there’s no connected device (where the concerned key would start flashing). Furthermore, the included 2.4GHz dongle does not have a slot on the keyboard. So, you have to keep it in a separate plastic bag and hope you don’t lose it.</p><p> It gets a bit worse if you use both Mac and Windows. You need to toggle a slider to switch between these operating systems, which, unfortunately, sits under the caps lock key. So, if you’re like me and use both macOS and Windows, you constantly need the keycap puller (for pulling out the caps lock keycap) and switch puller (for gingerly moving the slider to the proper mode) with you.</p><p> It would’ve been better if Akko included at least a single color-changing LED bulb to indicate the mode the keyboard is currently on. And maybe they could put the OS mode switch on an easily reachable surface.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137216/26400" target="_top" id="2137216">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137216" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137216/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Questionable-Battery-Life"><a href="#Questionable-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Questionable Battery Life"></a>Questionable Battery Life</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/01/akko-mod007b-he-battery-level-check.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B HE Battery-Level Check"                ></p><p> Jowi Morales &#x2F; MakeUseOf</p><p> Another issue I faced with the Akko MOD007B is its battery life. I’ve never run out of power when reviewing other keyboards, but it’s the first time I did with this keyboard. Even with the RGB lights off, I need to charge more frequently. You also cannot check the power state while you’re charging—you have to unplug it to see how much power is left by pressing Fn+Spacebar.</p><p> Furthermore, the keyboard’s off switch sits on the OS mode slider (top for macOS and on battery power, center for Windows and power supply off, and bottom for Windows with the power turned on) under the caps lock keycap, making it inconvenient to turn off.</p><p> Granted that this keyboard will most likely sit on your desk in wired mode, it’s still better to allow the user to switch off the keyboard when not using it. This will help save power, especially if you transport the keyboard in your bag (like when going to a LAN party or an on-site competition) and want to use it wirelessly.</p><h2 id="Your-Keyboard-for-Gaming-Victory"><a href="#Your-Keyboard-for-Gaming-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Your Keyboard for Gaming Victory"></a>Your Keyboard for Gaming Victory</h2><p> Although these couple of issues will negatively impact niche users like me, they won’t affect most users. You can’t ignore the benefits of a Hall Effect keyboard, especially if you take your matches seriously.</p><p> The level of customization you get with the Akko MOD007B is unprecedented, especially if you’re transitioning from a mechanical keyboard. And while some professional matches might ban the Dynamic Keyboard feature, just the ability to set a custom actuation pressure makes this keyboard worth it.</p><p> So, if you are or plan to be a serious gamer, the Akko MOD007B is an excellent choice for a primary keyboard. And, as long as you don’t frequently switch between Windows and Mac, it’s a great all-around keyboard, too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/world-tour-tokyo-mod007b-pc-3-600x600.jpg"                      alt="Akko MOD007B PC eCommerce Image"                ></p><h5 id="AKKO-MOD007B-PC-1"><a href="#AKKO-MOD007B-PC-1" class="headerlink" title="AKKO MOD007B PC"></a>AKKO MOD007B PC</h5><p> 7&#x2F; 10</p><p> The Akko MOD007B HE PC uses Hall Effect switches to give you a gaming advantage.

However, this small sacrifice allows someone to play and enjoy games they love with more accessibility.</li></ul><p> Using an assist controller on your PS5 allows you to connect two controllers that act like one. If you want to make use of this handy accessibility feature on your PS5 but you’re not sure how to, we’ve got you covered.</p><h2 id="What-Does-an-Assist-Controller-Do-on-the-PS5"><a href="#What-Does-an-Assist-Controller-Do-on-the-PS5" class="headerlink" title="What Does an Assist Controller Do on the PS5?"></a>What Does an Assist Controller Do on the PS5?</h2><p> Being able to connect an assist controller to your PS5 is Sony’s answer to the copilot feature on Xbox. Using an assist controller is a far different experience than simply connecting two DualSense controllers and calling it a day.</p><p> Adding a second controller adds another player, who becomes a player two. An assist controller, however, allows two different controllers to operate the same user profile, so the two controllers behave as one single controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/person-holding-dualsense-controller-with-ps4-controller-on-a-red-background.jpg"                      alt="Person holding DualSense Controller with PS4 controller on a red background"                ></p><p> This accessibility feature is particularly helpful for those with decreased mobility. One player can control the direction an avatar is moving or attacking, while the other can take control of the camera, for example.</p><p> It’s also useful for young gamers who need a little extra assistance from a parent to beat a particularly formidable final boss. There are plenty of scenarios where an assist controller could be helpful. So if you want to learn how to use this feature on your PS5, follow the instructions below.</p><h2 id="How-Do-I-Set-Up-an-Assist-Controller-on-My-PS5"><a href="#How-Do-I-Set-Up-an-Assist-Controller-on-My-PS5" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Set Up an Assist Controller on My PS5?"></a>How Do I Set Up an Assist Controller on My PS5?</h2><p> There are a few things to note before getting started. Firstly, the ability to connect an assist controller to your PS5 was introduced in an update. So, if you haven’t<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-ps5-auto-updates/" >enabled auto-updates on your PS5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> yet, go ahead and update your PS5 manually to the latest version.</p><p> You also can’t use any controller as an assist controller. You can only connect a DualSense controller or another supported third-party controller. If you have the DualSense Edge controller, it can only be used as the main controller and cannot be used as an assist controller.</p><p> Once you have ticked the boxes above, you are ready to begin. The process is very similar to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-and-use-co-pilot-on-xbox-series-xs/" >setting up and using the copilot feature on Xbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , so if you have experience with that, it should be intuitive.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/settings-gear-icon-ps5-home-screen.jpg"                      alt="Settings Gear Icon PS5 Home Screen"                ></p><p> Start by connecting a controller and logging into a user profile. From there, open the settings by pressing the<strong>gear icon</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ps5-settings-accessibility-section.jpg"                      alt="PS5 Settings Accessibility Section"                ></p><p> Head to the<strong>Accessibility</strong> settings and scroll down to<strong>Controllers</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ps5-settings-use-second-controller-for-assistance.jpg"                      alt="PS5 Settings Use Second Controller for Assistance"                ></p><p> Tap<strong>Use Second Controller for Assistance</strong> , and make sure the<strong>Use Assist Controller</strong> switch is on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ps5-settings-use-assist-controller-switch.jpg"                      alt="PS5 Settings with Use Assist Controller toggle"                ></p><p> Take your second controller, turn it on, and select the same<strong>user profile</strong> that the main controller is connected to. It’s very important that both controllers are connected to the same user profile. If not, the process will not be successful.

They have small button inputs that require very tight movements and a claw-like grip. This kind of setup just doesn’t work for many people, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be able to enjoy or experience gaming.</p><p> There are many accessibility controllers on the market, but they are often expensive and also have limits to the number of people they can work for. Adding an assist controller to your PS5 is a cheap and effective way to make gaming more accessible on a budget, particularly if you have two controllers already.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-discreet-downloaders-ranked-2023s-best-8-selections/"><u>[New] Discreet Downloaders Ranked 2023'S Best 8 Selections</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-efficient-tiktok-twitter-crossposting-guide/"><u>[New] Efficient TikTok-Twitter Crossposting Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-masterful-techniques-to-alter-facial-gender-in-instagram-snapchat-and-facebook-pictures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Masterful Techniques to Alter Facial Gender in Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook Pictures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-pioneers-guide-to-documenting-private-whatsapp-discussions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Pioneer's Guide to Documenting Private WhatsApp Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/expert-networking-for-epic-games-and-steam-connection/"><u>Expert Networking for Epic Games & Steam Connection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/flip-it-like-a-pro-reversed-snaps-technique-for-2024/"><u>Flip It Like a Pro Reversed Snaps Technique for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-can-i-catch-the-regional-pokemon-without-traveling-on-infinix-smart-7-hd-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Infinix Smart 7 HD | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/roblox-fps-mod-unlocking-secrets-and-safety/"><u>Roblox FPS Mod: Unlocking Secrets and Safety</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/sharpen-your-stream-top-5-video-improvement-tech/"><u>Sharpen Your Stream Top 5 Video Improvement Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/tackling-non-display-issues-in-epic-games-libraries/"><u>Tackling Non-Display Issues in Epic Games Libraries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/transform-your-brain-power-with-nyts-latest-intellectual-puzzle-strands/"><u>Transform Your Brain Power with NYT’s Latest Intellectual Puzzle - 'Strands'</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-mid-range-1440p-gaming-screens-in-town/"><u>Unveiling the Best Mid-Range 1440P Gaming Screens in Town</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As the name suggests, idle games require less direct input than a typical first-person shooter or precision platformer. They let you make progress simply by having the game running, potentially alongside other games, videos, or—whisper it quietly—work.</p><p> Idle games often start by being anything but idle, though, requiring constant interaction. This is often in the form of simple, repetitive mouse clicking which is about as fun as it sounds. However, a typical idle game soon ramps up the fun. By offering upgrades to automate the manual work, idle games scale your abilities in tandem with your objective.</p><h2 id="Which-Idle-Games-Can-I-Play"><a href="#Which-Idle-Games-Can-I-Play" class="headerlink" title="Which Idle Games Can I Play?"></a>Which Idle Games Can I Play?</h2><p> There are many idle games you can play for free, and most of them are available in your web browser.

You may need to just switch to them very briefly to make meaningful advances, so the temptation to do so is strong. Pretty soon, you might find you are switching more and more frequently,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/context-switching-sabotaging-productivity-what-you-can-do/" >sabotaging your productivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Idle games are often also incremental games, so progress occurs—or, at least, appears to occur—exponentially. This aspect helps to create a sense of achievement beyond a typical linear scale, so playing an idle game can be more rewarding.</p><h2 id="Are-Idle-Games-Ruining-the-Industry"><a href="#Are-Idle-Games-Ruining-the-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Are Idle Games Ruining the Industry?"></a>Are Idle Games Ruining the Industry?</h2><p> Idle games have possibly reached the peak of their popularity, representing a significant fad that has since waned. But their influence has been far and wide, and many share business models and techniques with other mobile and web-based games.</p><p> Some idle games<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/examples-of-gaming-microtransactions/" >offer microtransactions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to speed up their gameplay. These incentives can be tricky to resist when a small amount of money has a great impact on progress. Idle games are very often free to play, so need to find alternative revenue sources, including in-game advertising.</p><p> Meanwhile, many people dismiss idle games as simple, low-quality efforts.

At times, your Windows 10 or 11 PC may fail to detect the gaming controller or register its inputs.</p><p> Don’t worry, there’s no need to purchase a new controller just yet. Here are some fixes that should get your controller working again on Windows.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Check-if-Windows-Recognizes-Your-Controller"><a href="#1-Check-if-Windows-Recognizes-Your-Controller" class="headerlink" title="1. Check if Windows Recognizes Your Controller"></a>1. Check if Windows Recognizes Your Controller</h2><p> The first thing you need to do is check if Windows recognizes your controller. For that, you will need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-launch-game-controllers-settings-windows-11/" >open the Game Controller Settings on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Here’s how to do that.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + R</strong> to open the Run dialog box.</li><li>Type<strong>joy.cpl</strong> in the box and press<strong>Enter</strong> .</li><li>In the Game Controllers window, read the status of your controller.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/controller-status-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Controller Status on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> If your controller does not show up in the Game Controllers window or the status does not say<strong>OK</strong> , you may be experiencing a connection problem.</p><h2 id="2-Disconnect-and-Reconnect-the-Controller"><a href="#2-Disconnect-and-Reconnect-the-Controller" class="headerlink" title="2.

This may seem like a simple solution, but it is often effective.</p><p> If it is a wired controller, try connecting it to a different USB port. For a wireless controller, you need to make sure it has enough battery. If it does, try unpairing and pairing it again.</p><h2 id="3-Scan-for-Hardware-Changes"><a href="#3-Scan-for-Hardware-Changes" class="headerlink" title="3. Scan for Hardware Changes"></a>3. Scan for Hardware Changes</h2><p> If unplugging and plugging the controller proves ineffective, you can scan your system for hardware changes using Device Manager. To do so, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the<strong>Start icon</strong> and select<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list.</li><li>Right-click anywhere on an empty spot within the Device Manager window and select<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scan-for-hardware-changes-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Scan for Hardware Changes on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> Following that, your controller should appear in the Device Manager window and work as expected.</p><h2 id="4-Run-the-Relevant-Window-Troubleshooters"><a href="#4-Run-the-Relevant-Window-Troubleshooters" class="headerlink" title="4. Run the Relevant Window Troubleshooters"></a>4. Run the Relevant Window Troubleshooters</h2><p> If your gaming controller is recognized by Windows but refuses to work, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This tool will try to fix any common problems and get your gaming controller to work on Windows.</p><p>To run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, use these steps:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + R</strong> to open the Run dialog box.</li><li>Type<strong>msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic</strong> in the box and press<strong>Enter</strong> .</li><li>In the Hardware and Devices window, click<strong>Advanced</strong> .</li><li>Tick the checkbox that reads<strong>Apply repairs automatically</strong> and click<strong>Next</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hardware-and-Devices-Troubleshooter-Window.jpg"                      alt="Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter Window"                ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135397/19272" target="_top" id="2135397">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135397" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135397/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Allow the troubleshooter to find and fix any issues.

If that’s the case, updating the problematic driver should help fix the issue. Here’s how to do that.</p><ol><li>Open Device Manager using the search menu.</li><li>Locate your controller on the list of devices. Right-click on it and select<strong>Update driver</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> .</li><li>Select the<strong>Search for updated drivers on Windows Update</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/update-controller-driver-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Update Controller Driver on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> Wait for Windows to check for any pending updates for the driver and install them.</p><p> If the controller still does not work after that, the controller driver may be corrupted. In that case, you will need to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-uninstall-drivers/" >uninstall the faulty driver from your Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

So, if none of the above tips help, open your controller manufacturer’s app or program and install any available updates.</p><p> This step will vary depending on what controller model you own and which company made it. As such, refer to your manufacturer’s manual or online help service for more information.</p><h2 id="Fixing-Controller-Issues-on-Windows-Made-Easy"><a href="#Fixing-Controller-Issues-on-Windows-Made-Easy" class="headerlink" title="Fixing Controller Issues on Windows Made Easy"></a>Fixing Controller Issues on Windows Made Easy</h2><p> Unless your controller is faulty or damaged, one of the above tips should get it to work again.

Consider using open-back headphones for the best directionality.</li></ul><p> HRTF has the potential to greatly improve your awareness in Valorant. We’re here to help you find out if it’s right for you and how to use it properly.</p><h2 id="What-Is-HRTF-in-Valorant"><a href="#What-Is-HRTF-in-Valorant" class="headerlink" title="What Is HRTF in Valorant?"></a>What Is HRTF in Valorant?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/valorant-on-riot-client.JPG"                      alt="valorant on riot client"                ></p><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> HRTF stands for Head-Related Transfer Function, and it transforms the incoming audio into how sound would hit your head depending on where it’s coming from. HRTF is an audio processing setting in Valorant released in patch 2.06.</p><p> Because of how our heads and ears are shaped, things sound differently from different directions. HRTF simulates this change in sound through mathematics, so it’s not just a “surround sound” filter that makes things sound hollow like those pesky 7.1 surround sound features on gaming headphones.</p><p> HRTF transforms the sound based on a model head and ear shape. While your head may not match the Valorant HRTF model perfectly, in most cases, having it close enough will provide you with that directional detail.</p><h2 id="How-Does-HRTF-Help-Valorant-Players"><a href="#How-Does-HRTF-Help-Valorant-Players" class="headerlink" title="How Does HRTF Help Valorant Players?"></a>How Does HRTF Help Valorant Players?</h2><p> Headphones only have two drivers, left and right. That makes sense since we only have two ears, right? Absolutely not. While we only have two ears, our whole head does the hearing, and it can perceive sound horizontally, vertically, and everywhere in between.</p><p> Traditional stereo headphones can only ever communicate left, right, and a mix of those two channels—a two-dimensional image of sound. You’ll know that the enemy’s footsteps are coming from the left, right, or somewhere in between, but it’s just a flat plane. Stereo sound without HRTF is like watching TV; the screen’s image may provide good information, but it’s still on a 2D screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/meta-quest-pro-on-table.jpg"                      alt="Black or Space Gray Meta Quest Pro With Joystick on Table"                ></p><p> Image Credit:<a class="link"   href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/meta-quest-pro-social-vr-connect-2022/" >Meta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> HRTF is like VR for your ears Your brain is still getting 2D input, but it simulates how your senses would receive the information in 3D. Take a listen to the Vandal at the end of this short HRTF demo below. With HRTF off, it sounds like the Vandal at the end is right next to you—with it on, you can clearly hear that it’s slightly above you.</p><p> HRTF tricks your brain into thinking that a sound came from a certain direction by sounding just like how your ears would hear it if the sound actually came from that direction in real life. If the demo above didn’t have that effect for you, it’s most likely you didn’t notice it, or you may be better off without it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Enable-HRTF-in-Valorant-and-Use-it-Properly"><a href="#How-to-Enable-HRTF-in-Valorant-and-Use-it-Properly" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable HRTF in Valorant and Use it Properly"></a>How to Enable HRTF in Valorant and Use it Properly</h2><p> To enable HRTF in Valorant, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Audio</strong> and click on the empty box on<strong>Enable HRTF</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/enabling-hrtf-in-valorant.jpg"                      alt="Enabling HRTF in Valorant"                ></p><p> Once it’s on, test it out in Deathmatch or in a private match with a friend. Try to check if the directionality is accurate for you or not, so you can find out if it’s worth turning on.</p><p> If you do decide to use HRTF and it sounds off, you might think that the HRTF model doesn’t match you. That could be a possible case, but we urge you to try out these quick fixes to make sure it’s running right.</p><p> HRTF can sound inaccurate and even terrible if other HRTF sound processing software like Windows Sonic, DTS Headphone:X, or Dolby Atmos is turned on. You should also avoid turning on those virtual 7.1 surround sound features on gaming headphones, which don’t even get close to HRTF’s accuracy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/08/sennheiser-hd599-se-on-brown-mousepad.JPG"                      alt="Sennheiser HD599 SE on brown mousepad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image Credit: Jhet Borja</p><p> If you really want the best directionality, you might also want to try some alternatives to gaming headphones, like open-back headphones, which are excellent for 3D sound.

However, it can’t run every game flawlessly. In those situations, you may want to stream a game from another device within your home.</p><p> Let’s have a look at how to use Steam Remote Play to stream games to your Steam Deck.</p><h2 id="Steam-Remote-Play-and-Streaming"><a href="#Steam-Remote-Play-and-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Steam Remote Play and Streaming"></a>Steam Remote Play and Streaming</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_steam_temtem_stream_option_available-1.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of a game in Steam with the stream option available"                ></p><p> You may have used Steam Remote Play before. It’s actually been a feature in Steam’s tool set long before the Steam Deck was ever announced.</p><p> This service depends heavily on a decent router and a strong connection to your Wi-Fi. These points should be considered before diving in, as the remote play experience can be negatively affected otherwise.</p><p> If you run into any problems, consider some<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-steam-remote-play-not-working/" >basic Steam Remote Play troubleshooting steps on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and then consider if your router needs an upgrade.</p><h2 id="How-to-Enable-and-Use-Steam-Remote-Play"><a href="#How-to-Enable-and-Use-Steam-Remote-Play" class="headerlink" title="How to Enable and Use Steam Remote Play"></a>How to Enable and Use Steam Remote Play</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_steam_remote_play_option.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of steam remote play enabled in options"                ></p><p> Steam Remote Play is enabled with a simple toggle in the settings. Open up Steam on your main computer, and then hit the<strong>Steam</strong> button in the top left-hand corner. Then click into<strong>Settings</strong> and finally<strong>Remote Play.</strong></p><p> Toggle<strong>Enable Remote Play</strong> on. You’ll also want to do this on your Steam Deck, which has the setting in the same menu. The only difference is that you’ll hit the physical Steam button to find the settings menu.</p><p> Once this setting is enabled on both your main computer and your Steam Deck, you’ll notice that games now have a drop-down menu available next to the<strong>Install&#x2F;Play</strong> button. If you can’t see it, try restarting your Steam Deck.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_remote_play_options_on_steam_deck.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of remote play options on steam on deck steam"                ></p><p> All you have to do now is click on this drop-down menu and select the name of your PC. This will prompt you whether you’d like to stream the game from the PC or play it from your current device. Be careful you don’t accidentally initiate the installation process for the game you’re trying to stream.</p><p> Keep in mind that certain games will require you to change the controller configuration before you get to playing. This is because Remote Play, by default, uses a touchscreen interface if one is available. While the Steam Deck has a touch screen, you’ll probably prefer to use the actual controller attached to your device.</p><h2 id="Tips-to-Reduce-Latency-While-Streaming-to-Steam-Deck"><a href="#Tips-to-Reduce-Latency-While-Streaming-to-Steam-Deck" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Reduce Latency While Streaming to Steam Deck"></a>Tips to Reduce Latency While Streaming to Steam Deck</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_of_steam_remote_play_advanced_options.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of steam remote play advanced options"                ></p><p> First and foremost, a wired connection to your PC is a must. While there have been success stories about streaming your game entirely over Wi-Fi, having at least a wired connection to your PC will clear up many common issues.</p><p> The Steam Deck has an entirely serviceable, but not perfect, Wi-Fi experience. This means your PC really has to pick up the slack in terms of connection speeds, and even then, you may experience the occasional jitter or frame that hangs for just too long.</p><p> All the common<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-reduce-latency-speed-up-cloud-gaming/" >tips to reduce latency for cloud-based gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apply here, so do your research to make sure you can maintain a robust connection before you jump into any high-action games.</p><p> Another thing to consider is<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-you-should-buy-a-steam-deck-dock/" >using the Steam Deck dock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , or similar product. While this may restrict the Steam Deck in a way that diminishes the purpose of Remote Play, it ensures that you’ll be able to use a wired connection there as well. With two wired connections, you can have an almost perfect streaming experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1444782">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1444782">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1444782.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1444782%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1444782/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Remote-Play-Unshackles-Your-Games"><a href="#Remote-Play-Unshackles-Your-Games" class="headerlink" title="Remote Play Unshackles Your Games"></a>Remote Play Unshackles Your Games</h2><p> With the Steam Deck already prioritizing a portable gaming experience, having the ability to run bigger games off your PC while relaxing on the Steam Deck really enhances its value.

They require you to think tactically as you lead your troops into battle and hopefully toward victory. And they all help immerse you in World War II.</p><p> From squad-based combat to continental-scale strategy, you can step into some of the most famous battles of all time to test your strategic mettle. Here are the best WW2 strategy games, both old and new, that are worth playing.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Company-of-Heroes-3"><a href="#1-Company-of-Heroes-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Company of Heroes 3"></a>1. Company of Heroes 3</h2><p> The original Company of Heroes is one of the best examples of real-time strategy games period, let alone in the war genre. The third entry is equally impressive.</p><p> Company of Heroes 3 offers campaign and skirmish modes in single player as well as online multiplayer fun. It looks great too, with an impressive sandbox that lets you blow up buildings to create dynamic cover.</p><p> If you’ve never played a Company of Heroes game before, it’s easy to jump in here thanks to the Full Tactical Pause feature available in single-player, which lets you pause the action and plan an attack at your own pace.</p><h2 id="2-Steel-Division-2"><a href="#2-Steel-Division-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Steel Division 2"></a>2. Steel Division 2</h2><p> Steel Division 2 is set during Operation Bagration, across a great single-player campaign that puts you in the roles of General, Colonel, and Weapons Expert. It aims to be historically accurate, with more than 600 units to control across 25 huge maps.</p><p> One awesome thing about Steel Division 2 is that you can either fight in the fun real-time tactical combat, or you can automatically resolve them if you just want the pure strategic experience.</p><p> On top of all that, the game looks great. So much attention has been paid to the vehicles and environments that you’ll feel totally immersed in the World War II experience.</p><h2 id="3-Hearts-of-Iron-IV"><a href="#3-Hearts-of-Iron-IV" class="headerlink" title="3. Hearts of Iron IV"></a>3. Hearts of Iron IV</h2><p> Instead of controlling individual units, Hearts of Iron IV puts you in command of the highest-level strategy in the war. You develop technology, build and outfit armies, control forces on land, sea, and air, and launch invasions that will change the tide of the war.</p><p> You also handle negotiations, trade, and politics. By appointing ministers and generals, you can use the game’s AI to help you ensure victory. Plus, you can do it with any country involved in the war, from the major players to the smaller nations just trying to survive.</p><p> This is a complex game, and it requires a monumental amount of strategic thinking. If you want to see what World War II must have looked from the highest level of command, this is the game for you.</p><h2 id="4-Order-of-Battle-World-War-II"><a href="#4-Order-of-Battle-World-War-II" class="headerlink" title="4. Order of Battle: World War II"></a>4. Order of Battle: World War II</h2><p> Order of Battle: World War II may seem like a free-to-play game, but you actually buy each campaign individually. It’s very expensive if you buy them all, so instead it’s better to pick and choose from those that interest you the most.</p><p> Thankfully, you can play the first chapter of each campaign pack for free to get a taste of the action. You’ll find a slick and detailed game packed full of content—with over 700 units, including infantry, tanks, ships, and aircraft.</p><p> If you like traditional turn-based hex gameplay, this is the game for you. It’s easy to pick up, but packs a lot of depth, and has some nice animations and effects to keep things interesting.</p><h2 id="5-Panzer-Corps-2"><a href="#5-Panzer-Corps-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzer Corps 2"></a>5. Panzer Corps 2</h2><p> Panzer Corps is a beloved WW2 strategy game, and this sequel takes what worked in the original and improves upon it.</p><p> According to the developers, no other game has as many authentic World War II vehicles. There are over 1,000 unique units, each modeled with incredible detail and realistic animations. You can take charge of them in the single-player campaign or online.</p><p> Once you’re done with the game’s main content, you can use the powerful scenario editor to build your own campaigns and maps with ease. Panzer Corps 2 is so deep that you may never need to buy another WW2 game again.</p><h2 id="6-Codename-Panzers"><a href="#6-Codename-Panzers" class="headerlink" title="6. Codename: Panzers"></a>6. Codename: Panzers</h2><p> Codename: Panzers was first released in 2004, but it has since been remastered to work with modern systems and support larger resolutions. Despite its age, this is a game that is still worth playing thanks to its timeless tactical fun.</p><p> Across landscapes like small towns, bleak mountains, and murky swamps, Codename: Panzers plunges you into the depths of war and lets you control lots of units like a battle tank, a flame-throwing squad, an organ rocket launcher, and more.</p><p> While there is an online multiplayer mode to keep you happy, you should definitely check out the story mode, which is engrossing and supported by great voice acting.</p><h2 id="7-War-in-the-East"><a href="#7-War-in-the-East" class="headerlink" title="7. War in the East"></a>7. War in the East</h2><p> War in the East is a different type of WW2 strategy game. It descends from a long line of tabletop war games, and it shows; it captures the look of cardboard pieces on paper maps.</p><p> Despite that, it packs a huge amount of strategic heft. You wage war along the entire Eastern front, and you can play through five different campaigns. You have access to a wide variety of units, including ski troopers, engineers, pioneers, and tank destroyers.</p><p> Beyond combat, you also manage production, supply lines, weather, and fog of war effects. This is a complicated, challenging strategy game that you can sink hundreds of hours into.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Men-of-War-Assault-Squad-2"><a href="#8-Men-of-War-Assault-Squad-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Men of War: Assault Squad 2"></a>8. Men of War: Assault Squad 2</h2><p> If you’re looking for a WW2 strategy game that has a lot to offer, you can’t go wrong with Assault Squad 2. It’s a top-down real-time strategy game that lets you control every unit in your squad. 200 soldiers with unique loadouts, 250 vehicles, and five different factions make for a huge amount of variety.</p><p> There’s a realistic and gritty feel here that few games manage to capture—it’s almost like starring in one of<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/world-war-ii-movies-watch-netflix/" >the best World War II movies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The graphics are great and help immerse in the action. You face off against other armored units, engage in sniper battles, and pit groups of infantry against the enemy in massive engagements.</p><p> Be warned that this game won’t hold your hand and you will find it very difficult. Welcome to World War II.</p><h2 id="9-Sudden-Strike-4"><a href="#9-Sudden-Strike-4" class="headerlink" title="9. Sudden Strike 4"></a>9. Sudden Strike 4</h2><p> There’s one thing that sets Sudden Strike 4 apart from many of its contemporaries: it’s one of the few WW2 strategy games available on PS4 and Xbox One, as well as on PC.</p><p> Beyond that, it has a lot of what you’d expect from a typical WW2 RTS game: 100 units to command, zoned damage areas on tanks, building occupations, and so on. It’s a great-looking game that lets you take on three campaigns from three different sides of the war.</p><p> If you’re looking for a console-based WW2 strategy experience, Sudden Strike 4 is the way to go.</p><h2 id="10-Unity-of-Command-II"><a href="#10-Unity-of-Command-II" class="headerlink" title="10. Unity of Command II"></a>10. Unity of Command II</h2><p> If you only decide to buy one WW2 strategy game, you can’t go wrong with Unity of Command II. It’s a follow-up to the 2011 cult classic, putting you in command of the Western Allies as you manage their supply and logistics.</p><p> No two play sessions are the same thanks to dynamic campaigns that branch out with your decisions, meaning you can alter the course of history. Despite that, there’s still a keen attention to detail in the units that will please history buffs.</p><p> There’s also a scenario editor with Steam Workshop support, so you can build your own campaigns and download other people’s with ease.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="11-Close-Combat"><a href="#11-Close-Combat" class="headerlink" title="11.

It’s a top-down strategy series that puts the focus on realism. Your troops have changing mental and physical conditions, you need to scavenge for ammunition, and a troop’s experience on the battlefield impacts how they react to a situation.</p><p> Each game in the Close Combat series focuses on a different, real-life key event from WWII, with grand campaigns playing out on large maps, so choose the one which interests you the most. 2019’s Close Combat: The Bloody First was the first 3D entry, though reviews for that are mixed.</p><p> Don’t let the old-school graphics put you off; it’s the gameplay that matters.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Evaluating-Fast-Resume-Feature-for-Xbox-S-X"><a href="#Evaluating-Fast-Resume-Feature-for-Xbox-S-X" class="headerlink" title="Evaluating Fast Résumé Feature for Xbox S&#x2F;X"></a>Evaluating Fast Résumé Feature for Xbox S&#x2F;X</h2><p> Most next-gen gaming consoles have unique features to convince you to buy one platform over the other. But some of these features are forgotten by the time consoles progress to the next generation. The Xbox One and its TV gimmicks are a perfect example of this.</p><p> However, the Quick Resume feature for Xbox offers you lighting fast load times if you’re an Xbox Series X|S owner. But it isn’t without fault. So are the benefits of Quick Resume worth some of the restrictions that come with it, or will it end up like some of the Xbox gimmicks of the past? Let’s find out.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-Quick-Resume-Benefits-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S-Gaming-Experience"><a href="#How-Quick-Resume-Benefits-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S-Gaming-Experience" class="headerlink" title="How Quick Resume Benefits Your Xbox Series X|S Gaming Experience"></a>How Quick Resume Benefits Your Xbox Series X|S Gaming Experience</h2><p> With Quick Resume allowing you to pick up a game from exactly where you left it, even if you unplug your Xbox Series X|S from its power supply, there are obvious benefits to the feature. Let’s take a look at some:</p><h3 id="1-Quick-Resume-Guarantees-Your-Progress-in-Supported-Games"><a href="#1-Quick-Resume-Guarantees-Your-Progress-in-Supported-Games" class="headerlink" title="1. Quick Resume Guarantees Your Progress in Supported Games"></a>1. Quick Resume Guarantees Your Progress in Supported Games</h3><p> Perhaps the most obvious benefit, and the most useful to you, is how Quick Resume can guarantee your progress in games that use it. By this, even if you turn your Xbox Series X|S off, you can resume your game when you next turn it on to the last auto-save, cloud save, or save state.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/stock-gaming.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of someone playing Fortnite on a gaming console"                ></p><p> While this is still slightly limited, it certainly beats relying on manual saves only or an in-game auto-save function, which in the event of something like a power cut, wouldn’t work anyway. But with Quick Resume, you have an in-built function on your Xbox working to help preserve your progress at all times.</p><p> If you already<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-xbox-series-x-quick-resume/" >use Quick Resume on your Xbox Series X|S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and rely on it for saves, just be mindful that the feature can only support up to three save states at once. So as long as you don’t have more than three games running through Quick Resume you should be fine.</p><h3 id="2-You-Can-Shorten-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S-Load-Times-With-Quick-Resume"><a href="#2-You-Can-Shorten-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S-Load-Times-With-Quick-Resume" class="headerlink" title="2. You Can Shorten Your Xbox Series X|S Load Times With Quick Resume"></a>2. You Can Shorten Your Xbox Series X|S Load Times With Quick Resume</h3><p> Aside from the most useful feature of Quick Resume, the most consistently beneficial aspect is how it allows you to almost instantly resume supported games, making load times feel like a thing of the past.</p><p> There are many<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tips-get-more-xbox-series-x-s/" >tips you can use to get more from your Xbox Series X|S <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but being able to jump past initial loading screens by resuming your games right where you left them completely changes how you play on Xbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/loading.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of wall art depicting a typical loading screen"                ></p><p> This is especially prevalent when playing games notorious for bad load times. The first time you inevitably replay The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim but jump past the barrage of loading with Quick Resume will almost completely sell the feature’s worth.</p><p> But while this feature is undoubtedly beneficial, it’s not perfect, and even the benefits of shortening load times come with caveats.</p><h2 id="The-Problems-With-Quick-Resume-on-Xbox-Series-X-S"><a href="#The-Problems-With-Quick-Resume-on-Xbox-Series-X-S" class="headerlink" title="The Problems With Quick Resume on Xbox Series X|S"></a>The Problems With Quick Resume on Xbox Series X|S</h2><p> Quick Resume may provide huge leaps forward when it comes to game preservation and altering the way loading times work on consoles, but the feature is in dire need of fine-tuning. As it is, Quick Resume has a fair share of problems. Let’s take a look at some of the biggest offenders:</p><h3 id="1-Quick-Resume-Has-Created-New-Issues-for-Multiplayer-Gaming"><a href="#1-Quick-Resume-Has-Created-New-Issues-for-Multiplayer-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="1. Quick Resume Has Created New Issues for Multiplayer Gaming"></a>1. Quick Resume Has Created New Issues for Multiplayer Gaming</h3><p> Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues with Quick Resume on your Xbox Series X|S is caused by one of its main benefits: reducing loading times.</p><p> For multiplayer or<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/live-service-games-what-how-work/" >live-service-based gaming <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Quick Resume will nearly always load you into the main menu, not where you last left off. Not only does this go against the whole purpose of Quick Resume, but it can also mean needing to restart your entire game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2602.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the Multiplayer screen for Halo Infinite after loading with Quick Resume"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977006">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977006">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977006%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977006/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> If you play games like Halo Infinite or backwards compatible titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Quick Resume puts you in the main menu while disconnecting you from the online server. In these cases, you’ll need to reconnect or restart your game before you can play online.</p><p> If this happens, you could see Quick Resume as prolonging the time it takes to enter a game, and with online-only multiplayer experiences taking control of the gaming industry, this problem will only get worse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115940/19272" target="_top" id="2115940">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115940" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115940/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Quick-Resume-Is-a-Mandatory-Feature-of-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S"><a href="#2-Quick-Resume-Is-a-Mandatory-Feature-of-Your-Xbox-Series-X-S" class="headerlink" title="2. Quick Resume Is a Mandatory Feature of Your Xbox Series X|S"></a>2. Quick Resume Is a Mandatory Feature of Your Xbox Series X|S</h3><p> A further complication of Quick Resume on Xbox Series X|S is that if you find yourself affected by some of its issues, like disconnecting from servers or being locked in a main menu, there is no way to disable it.</p><p> Quick Resume is baked into Xbox Series X|S consoles and turning the feature off isn’t an available option if you have problems with the feature. Instead, you can use the<strong>Quick Resume</strong> tab under<strong>My games &amp; apps</strong> in the Guide menu of your Xbox to individually select<strong>Remove from Quick Resume</strong> before loading a game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/screenshot-2584.jpg"                      alt="A screenshot of the option to Remove From Quick Resume on Xbox Series X"                ></p><p> But even with this function, Quick Resume adds unnecessary steps to loading a game you want to play. And without a way to universally deactivate the feature or, better yet, disable it for online games only, it remains an unreliable and sometimes irritating feature of your Xbox Series X|S.</p><h2 id="Quick-Resume-Needs-to-Accommodate-for-Online-Gaming"><a href="#Quick-Resume-Needs-to-Accommodate-for-Online-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Quick Resume Needs to Accommodate for Online Gaming"></a>Quick Resume Needs to Accommodate for Online Gaming</h2><p> While Quick Resume is a huge leap forward on paper and in practice for some games, the feature doesn’t accommodate all your gaming needs and is far from reliable.</p><p> Unfortunately, until Xbox releases a way for you to remove the feature for online gaming or even correct some of the issues with online gaming, it may become an even bigger hindrance than it already is.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/yellow-xbox-one-controller.jpg"                      alt="A photograph of an Xbox One controller in front of a bright yellow background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> And without changes, you could find Quick Resume going down the same avenue as Xbox features of the past. Luckily, Xbox has stated that it will address this issue at some point, as reported by<a class="link"   href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-says-xbox-will-look-at-letting-players-disable-quick-resume/" >Video Games Chronicle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Hopefully, Xbox actually works on a fix soon, and don’t hold off until it’s too late.</p><h2 id="Quick-Resume-Is-a-Great-Idea-With-Irritating-Issues"><a href="#Quick-Resume-Is-a-Great-Idea-With-Irritating-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Quick Resume Is a Great Idea With Irritating Issues"></a>Quick Resume Is a Great Idea With Irritating Issues</h2><p> The ideas behind Quick Resume are sound, and the feature is amazing when it works, making it a legitimate reason you may look to get an Xbox Series X|S over a PlayStation 5—in theory.</p><p> Until the irritating issues with online games, which make up a large portion of the industry, are fixed, Quick Resume will remain frustrating. Even when the feature works, you’ll likely find it more surprising than consistent.</p><p> So, unless Quick Resume is fine-tuned, it and the unique features of Xbox Series X|S consoles will be held back.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-blueprint-for-traffic-boost-masterful-techniques-for-effective-fb-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Blueprint for Traffic Boost Masterful Techniques for Effective FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-cut-cost-unlock-creativity-step-by-step-guide-to-professional-green-screen-effects-from-top-4-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cut Cost, Unlock Creativity Step-by-Step Guide to Professional Green Screen Effects From Top 4 Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-watch-twitter-videos-in-full-hd/"><u>[Updated] How To Watch Twitter Videos in Full HD?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-magic-voice-transformation-is-this-app-feasible-discover-other-solutions/"><u>2024 Approved Magic Voice Transformation Is This App Feasible?

Both the RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti deliver marginal performance improvements over their previous-gen counterparts while also suffering from a restrained memory capacity and absolute bandwidth.</p><p> To make matters worse, the company released a 16GB variant of the RTX 4060 Ti with the same underlying specifications as the 8GB model but at a steep $100 price premium. Given the atrocious pricing structure for Nvidia’s current-gen GPU lineup, here are three alternatives that you might prefer buying instead of the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB.</p><h2 id="Nvidia-RTX-4060-Ti-16GB-Specifications-and-Overview"><a href="#Nvidia-RTX-4060-Ti-16GB-Specifications-and-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB: Specifications and Overview"></a>Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB: Specifications and Overview</h2><p> Before delving into our RTX 4060 Ti 16GB GPU alternatives list, let’s look at the specs to determine why this graphics card is such a poor contender in terms of performance and overall value.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>AD106</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manufacturing Process</strong></td><td>TSMC 5nm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CUDA Cores</strong></td><td>4,352</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Texture Units</strong></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RT Cores</strong></td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tensor Cores</strong></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Boost Clock</strong></td><td>2,535MHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory Bus Width</strong></td><td>128-bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory Speed</strong></td><td>18 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory Bandwidth</strong></td><td>288GB&#x2F;s</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TDP</strong></td><td>165W</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MSRP</strong></td><td>$500</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Similar to the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB, the 16GB variant is essentially a trimmed-down AD106 GPU (as seen previously in Nvidia’s RTX 4070 Mobile) based on the Ada Lovelace microarchitecture and built using TSMC’s N5 process node. It boasts a maximum of 4,352 CUDA Cores, 34 SMs, 136 Tensor Cores, 34 RT Cores, 136 TMUs, 48 ROPs, and an advertised Boost Clock of 2,535MHz respectively.</p><p> Despite retaining the same core specifications as its 8GB sibling on an identical 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant benefits from an additional 8GB VRAM by utilizing a clamshell configuration. For those uninitiated, GDDR6 memory chips require a 32-bit controller, and with a narrower 128-bit bus, only four of these chips can be accommodated.</p><p> Since GDDR6 chips are usually available in capacities ranging from 1GB to 2GB, the base model has been equipped with four double-density 2GB memory chips to facilitate an 8GB frame buffer. Meanwhile, the clamshell arrangement on Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB enables two memory modules to share a single 32-bit channel by positioning a total of eight GDDR6 chips on both sides of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-does-pcb-stand-for/" >PCB (Printed Circuit Board) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Owing to these adjustments, the 16GB variant ships with a TDP of 165W, making it slightly less efficient than the 8GB model in gaming and other productivity-focused workloads. Regardless, both GPUs take advantage of all the latest and greatest features associated with Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture, including the much-touted<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dlss-3-can-you-use-on-existing-hardware/" >DLSS 3 Frame Generation technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , AV1 encoding and decoding,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-nvidia-rtx-vsr/" >RTX Video Super Resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Reflex, and more.</p><p> Now, one of the glaring issues that discouraged most users from upgrading to the RTX 4060 Ti is its measly 8GB frame buffer. In an era where modern AAA titles typically consume more than 8GB of VRAM, even at 1080p Ultra settings (along with advanced ray tracing effects), mainstream $400 GPUs should arrive with at least 12GB of VRAM—16GB being the gold standard.</p><p> Although Nvidia tried to mitigate this limitation by launching a 16GB variant of the RTX 4060 Ti, the performance potential of this graphics card is somewhat affected by an already compromised 128-bit memory subsystem. Even the RTX 3060 Ti, a mid-range $400 GPU released way back in 2020, shipped with 8GB of VRAM on a much wider 256-bit memory bus—not to mention the substantial improvements to shader count and raw bandwidth.</p><p> As is evident from the benchmarking results, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB offers a modest 3-4% improvement to average FPS over the 8GB model in the vast majority of AAA games. However, the augmented VRAM capacity can certainly help boost the 1% and 0.1% lows by as much as 30%, at 1440p, in memory-intensive titles such as The Last of Us Part I, The Callisto Protocol, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p><p> Perhaps the most contentious aspect of this GPU launch is the $100 price increase for an additional 8GB frame buffer. At $500, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant, even with its beefed-up L2 cache (32MB), represents the worst cost per frame among all other mid-range graphics cards released in the last couple of generations.</p><h2 id="The-3-Best-RTX-4060-Ti-16GB-Alternatives-You-Should-Consider"><a href="#The-3-Best-RTX-4060-Ti-16GB-Alternatives-You-Should-Consider" class="headerlink" title="The 3 Best RTX 4060 Ti 16GB Alternatives You Should Consider"></a>The 3 Best RTX 4060 Ti 16GB Alternatives You Should Consider</h2><p> Given the lackluster performance of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant at resolutions above 1080p, here are three compelling GPU options that you should consider for your next upgrade, especially when gaming at 1440p or 4K.</p><h3 id="1-AMD-Radeon-RX-7800-XT"><a href="#1-AMD-Radeon-RX-7800-XT" class="headerlink" title="1.

Both variants stand favorably against the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, with the RX 7800 XT outperforming the latter considerably.</p><p> The benchmarks show that the RX 7800 XT secures a 30-45% rasterization lead over the RTX 4060 Ti in recent AAA titles, all while maintaining a 16GB frame buffer on a 256-bit memory interface. Although Nvidia has the upper hand in its RT implementation, the performance difference is now closer than you might have expected in the first place.</p><p> What’s even more surprising is that the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB received a $50 price discount right before the launch of these new Radeon graphics cards. This makes for an interesting comparison against AMD’s current-gen offerings, as the 16GB variant is now priced similarly to the Radeon RX 7700 XT at $449.</p><p> Nevertheless, if you plan to buy a mainstream $500 graphics card capable of running most modern AAA titles at resolutions above 1080p, look no further than the RX 7800 XT. For a 10% price premium, you should be able to get your hands on a much more powerful GPU with rasterization performance that aligns closely with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4070.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-AMD-Radeon-RX-6800"><a href="#2-AMD-Radeon-RX-6800" class="headerlink" title="2.

Based on the RDNA 2 microarchitecture, this GPU has also been equipped with 16GB of GDDR6 memory on a 256-bit bus, producing an effective bandwidth of around 512GB&#x2F;s.</p><p> Like before, the RX 6800 pulls off a comfortable lead over the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB by about 15-25% in rasterization performance while exhibiting a 5-8% deficit in games that implement advanced RT effects. However, when we compare the current pricing of both GPUs, the RX 6800, at $429, offers a better price-to-performance ratio than the competing RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant on multiple occasions.</p><h3 id="3-Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4070"><a href="#3-Nvidia-GeForce-RTX-4070" class="headerlink" title="3.

At a discounted price of $549, this GPU packs 12GB of GDDR6 memory on a 192-bit memory bus, almost doubling the absolute bandwidth of the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant.</p><p> Although the RX 7800 XT takes the crown for the best value GPU under $600, Nvidia’s recent pricing adjustments for its upper mid-range offering put it in a formidable position against the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB. On average, the RTX 4070 is 30% faster than the 16GB variant, and in select titles, the performance gap can widen to as much as 45%, making it a better value option for an extra $100.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Specifications</th><th>Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB</th><th>Nvidia RTX 4070</th><th>AMD RX 6800</th><th>AMD RX 7800 XT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AD106</td><td>AD104</td><td>Navi 21</td><td>Navi 32</td></tr><tr><td>Architecture</td><td>Ada Lovelace</td><td>Ada Lovelace</td><td>RDNA 2</td><td>RDNA 3</td></tr><tr><td>Process Node</td><td>TSMC N5</td><td>TSMC N5</td><td>TSMC 7nm</td><td>TSMC N5&#x2F;N6 FinFET</td></tr><tr><td>Transistor Count</td><td>22.9 Billion</td><td>35.8 Billion</td><td>26.8 Billion</td><td>28.1 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>Die Size</td><td>188 mm²</td><td>294 mm²</td><td>520 mm²</td><td>346mm²</td></tr><tr><td>CUs&#x2F;SMs</td><td>34</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tensor Cores&#x2F;AI Accelerators</td><td>136</td><td>184</td><td>N&#x2F;A</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>RT Cores&#x2F;Ray Accelerators</td><td>34</td><td>46</td><td>60</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Base Clock</td><td>2,310MHz</td><td>1,920MHz</td><td>1,700MHz</td><td>1,295MHz</td></tr><tr><td>Boost Clock</td><td>2,535MHz</td><td>2,475MHz</td><td>2,105MHz</td><td>2,430MHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Clock</td><td>2,250MHz</td><td>1,313MHz</td><td>2,000MHz</td><td>2,438MHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>18Gbps</td><td>21Gbps</td><td>16Gbps</td><td>19.5Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Capacity (VRAM)</td><td>16GB GDDR6</td><td>12GB GDDR6X</td><td>16GB GDDR6</td><td>16GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Bus Width</td><td>128-bit</td><td>192-bit</td><td>256-bit</td><td>256-bit</td></tr><tr><td>Infinity&#x2F;L2 Cache</td><td>32MB</td><td>36MB</td><td>128MB</td><td>64MB</td></tr><tr><td>TMUs</td><td>136</td><td>184</td><td>240</td><td>240</td></tr><tr><td>ROPs</td><td>48</td><td>64</td><td>96</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>FP32 (Single Precision) Performance</td><td>22.06 TFLOPS</td><td>29.15 TFLOPS</td><td>16.17 TFLOPS</td><td>37.32 TFLOPS</td></tr><tr><td>FP16 (Half Precision) Performance</td><td>22.06 TFLOPS (1:1)</td><td>29.15 TFLOPS (1:1)</td><td>32.33 TFLOPS (2:1)</td><td>74.65 TFLOPS (2:1)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>288GB&#x2F;s</td><td>504GB&#x2F;s</td><td>512GB&#x2F;s</td><td>624GB&#x2F;s</td></tr><tr><td>TBP&#x2F;TGP</td><td>165W</td><td>200W</td><td>250W</td><td>263W</td></tr><tr><td>Current Pricing</td><td>$449</td><td>$549</td><td>$429</td><td>$499</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115928/19272" target="_top" id="2115928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Another-Nail-in-the-Coffin"><a href="#Another-Nail-in-the-Coffin" class="headerlink" title="Another Nail in the Coffin"></a>Another Nail in the Coffin</h2><p> It’s worth pondering why Nvidia made such limited improvements to the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB variant. Unlike the 8GB model, the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB could have been a decent choice for budget-oriented consumers if its pricing was adjusted down by a tier or two.</p><p> While Frame Generation is certainly impressive from a technical standpoint, the feature loses quite a bit of its appeal at 1080p due to the limited pixel count of a lower resolution. As it currently stands, the RTX 4060 Ti is burdened by an unreasonably high price tag, one that you can safely bypass.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-complete-hulu-recording-manual-for-pc-mac-and-mobile-users/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Complete Hulu Recording Manual for PC, Mac & Mobile Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-live-recording-via-logitech-camera-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Live Recording via Logitech Camera Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-smart-strategies-achieving-advertising-excellence/"><u>[New] Smart Strategies Achieving Advertising Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-tailoring-your-video-content-through-youtube-studio-editing-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Tailoring Your Video Content Through YouTube Studio Editing Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleash-potential-ae-templates-for-aspiring-artists/"><u>2024 Approved Unleash Potential AE Templates for Aspiring Artists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/aerial-sovereign-unpacking-the-gopro-karma-system-for-2024/"><u>Aerial Sovereign Unpacking the GoPro Karma System for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/device-decisions-in-the-world-of-portable-games/"><u>Device Decisions in the World of Portable Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/dive-into-vr-streamlining-steam-gameplay-with-meta-quest-xperience/"><u>Dive Into VR: Streamlining Steam Gameplay with Meta Quest Xperience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/gaming-in-transition-evaluating-steams-rules-on-ai-integration/"><u>Gaming in Transition: Evaluating Steam’s Rules on AI Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-motorola-edge-40-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock a Network Locked Motorola Edge 40 Pro Phone?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-leading-meaningful-conversations-an-interviewers-journey/"><u>In 2024, Leading Meaningful Conversations An Interviewer's Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/mastering-ryujinx-controller-functions-for-ps4switch/"><u>Mastering Ryujinx Controller Functions for PS4/Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/modernize-nintendos-legacy-for-players/"><u>Modernize Nintendo's Legacy for Players</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/perfecting-the-steam-deck-experience-epic-and-gog/"><u>Perfecting the Steam Deck Experience: Epic and GOG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/stick-and-button-showdown-best-gaming-tool/"><u>Stick & Button Showdown: Best Gaming Tool?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/unexpected-tricks-to-refuel-your-cellphone-battery-no-standard-charger-involved/"><u>Unexpected Tricks to Refuel Your Cellphone Battery: No Standard Charger Involved</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
